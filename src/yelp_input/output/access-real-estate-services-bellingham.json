      "review": "Wish I could give zero stars. Never had an issue with a property management company before this one (call me lucky I suppose). However, this company finds sneaky ways to charge you fees (not small ones), and their customer service team will deflect and ignore any concerns you have regarding the clarity or legitimacy of said fees. Reaching out to the owner, Rachel, was also not helpful as she never answered any emails and the rest of her team would not ever put me in touch with her. Above all, Access's customer service was the worst I've ever dealt with. Customer service is hard work but they were consistently beyond rude any time we called, acting like it was a massive inconvenience to deal with anything.",

      "review": "Access has good people that seem to mean well but some are incompetent at their job. If you decide to move forward with them, expect poor service on weekends, independently check on your property after the tenant moves out, and most importantly, check their math! \n\nDuring my experience, I had rude customer service when I called on a Saturday, my property smelled of wet dog after the tenant moved out, and I was overcharged on multiple occasions. Access was quick to correct their accounting mistakes when I pointed them out so I would highly encourage anyone who uses their services to double check their invoices and challenge them as necessary - I was overcharged multiple times during my ~6 months with access.\n\nThe aforementioned inconveniences make the overall experience unpleasant. To the access team, I recommend double checking invoices before sending them out and maintaining an open line of communication with owners.",

      "review": "ATTENTION BELLINGHAM STUDENTS,\nACCESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE COMCAST OF RENTAL AGENCIES\n\nThis is the first business that has ever been so thoroughly unethical, that I felt compelled to warn the public about them.\n\nThese people are scam artists through and through; preying on the young and financially challenged. Their business seems to generate a significant portion of its income from fines, fees and extravagant move out charges. \n\nThey are very good at making it abundantly clear that their only goal is to generate profit and any expense. \n\nAdditionally, it seems that their business is very disorganized. They can not seem to keep track of any maintenance requests or documentation. After several written requests for repairs to features that were damaged upon move-in, we eventually gave up and just accepted that we were going to have to live with the pre-existing damage. Little did we know they would attempt to hold us financially responsible for said damage upon move-out.  \n\nThese people are not to be trusted and will take any action necessary to exert their power over the young and under privileged. If you attempt to dispute any of their actions or charges they will NOT hesitate to block youfrom contacting them, or even go as far as to take preemptive legal action against you.\n\n\nYou have been warned.",

Closed minded, unwilling to consider any suggestions. Forgets who she is working for.  She is going to do what benefits her and at her convienence only, and that is that!\n\nI gave this service 2 stars because she has some very nice, intelligent and personable employees.  Otherwise, she personally, gets zero stars from me.",

      "review": "Access refused our request to do the inspection walk through for check-out. I had never come across a company so uncooperative. Then I found out why- they took almost $600 from out deposit ! I had NEVER experienced such a huge amount taken out. We cleaned! The checkout notes said we damaged things that were already damaged. The damages even showed in their rental advertisements. When confronted with the advertisement pictures showing the damages, Access then changed their story and said all $600 was for 10 hours of cleaning. They also charged us $60 for changing a battery in the smoke detector when we already changed it. They did not listen, just took our money like some god damn robber. This family owned business is a family of thieves who prey on especially young inexperienced rentors. I'm considering taking them to small claims court to get our money back!",

They cancelled a showing 30 minutes prior and then as a consolation said that I could show up at a group showing to get involved with a circus.  I am inclined to never do business with them.  I hate the fact that it is a landlords market where they can treat everyone like they are in the hunger games.",

Another house we looked at had rotting beams under the raised parking and overall disrepair and uncleanliness, exposed pipes, garbage under the home, etc. One prospective tenant described the beams as \"rickety\" and was immediately snapped at by an employee who insisted that the overhanging platform was a part of the road (it wasn't).",

      "review": "If you enjoy renting from a company that actively steals from you, tries to upcharge without checking info, and doesn't care about their tenants than access is right for you! While renting from them for one year we experienced water coming up from the floor boards and were told this was a normal and ongoing issue and they would \"look into it\", they did not. We experienced plumbing issues, including waste leaking in from the upstairs unit, and Access was unhelpful and unconcerned. After an attempted break in we had to threaten them, as they kept hanging up, in order to have basic security measures enforced such as nailing the windows so no one could sneak in again. Additionally we were repeatedly \"charged\" for utilities and bills that were not in our name but in the last tenants information. This billing issue took over three months to fix and because of their speedy turnover in personnel we never talked to the same person twice. This company will take full advantage of anyone and especially college renters who may not be familiar with renters rights, an issue I now know by heart. I would give them negative stars if I could. Please avoid this godawful agency at all costs. I wish I had seen a review like this before I had signed a lease.",

This business is in the habit of taking advantage of college students who trust them. After working with Alex on a matter pertaining to my son's lease, I requested to speak with his supervisor. FIVE times. I was never given the information. I feel like the supervisor was aware of the situation and chose not to speak with me.\nDECEPTIVE. DISHONEST. SNEAKY.
