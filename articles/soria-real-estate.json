        "review": "Amber was extremely rude and condescending when we met. She was sent as \"An appraiser\" from Piazza Realty Property Mgmt, and low & behold, she was with another agent with the last name of Piazza! (No appraisal was done, just a lie to get them on the property and in my home. LOL\n She basically told me, we are going to start bringing people through your house whenever we please, even if nobody is home!\nI told her I would rather move out than face that type of invasion of my privacy.\nShe snidely replied (SEVERAL TIMES) You better get busy and move then!\nAfter about the 4th or 5th repetition of this statement, I used my outside voice and told her I heard her the 1st time & invited her to leave my property.\nUpon signing the papers at my new residence, I relayed this info to my realtor & when I told him what her name was, he rolled his eyes.. Apparently she has a reputation..\nI will never do business with them or recommend them.",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>    <heading><h2>Disclaimer</h2></heading>    <p>This article is generated by ChatGPT and is intended solely to assist individuals in finding a property management company or rental property. The summary below combines user reviews and does not reflect the personal experiences of the author of this article. It is a synthesized summary meant to provide a balanced perspective on Soria Real Estate based on the available user reviews.</p>  </section>    <section>    <heading><h2>Good</h2></heading>    <p>Based on the available data, there is currently limited positive feedback to highlight for Soria Real Estate. This lack of substantial good reviews may suggest that clients have not had sufficiently positive experiences worth sharing publicly, or that they are outnumbered by those who have had less favorable encounters. In the case that positive experiences exist, they have not been prominently shared in the user reviews available for this article.</p>    <p>In an effort to present a well-rounded view, it should be noted that this company is part of the local business landscape and has hence interacted with numerous clients. While specific user reviews may not showcase the company in a good light, it is possible that not all positive experiences have been recorded in user reviews.</p>  </section>    <section>    <heading><h2>Great</h2></heading>    <p>Despite the limited data, it can be worthwhile to consider that there may be unshared accounts of great service from Soria Real Estate. These instances could be reflected in repeat business or word-of-mouth recommendations that are not necessarily captured in online user reviews. It is conceivable that such occurrences simply have not been translated into written reviews, which can sometimes happen.</p>    <p>To maintain a balanced article, it should be said that any potential great services provided by Soria Real Estate may just be underrepresented online, and there could be instances where their performance met or even exceeded expectations in ways not detailed in the available user reviews.</p>  </section>    <section>    <heading><h2>Bad</h2></heading>    <p>The user review for Soria Real Estate indicates a negative experience with one of the company's representatives, who was described as rude and condescending. The reviewer expressed significant discontent with the approach taken by the representative during a particular visit, feeling that their privacy was threatened by the intention to bring people through the home arbitrarily. This reflection suggests a disregard for customer comfort and a possible pattern of miscommunication between the company and its clients.</p>    <p>Furthermore, the company's representative reportedly reiterated a dismissive comment multiple times in response to the customer's concerns, contributing to an unpleasant interaction that ultimately led the reviewer to find alternative accommodation. This behavior is a cause for potential concern, hinting at an underlying issue with the company\u2019s customer service approach and professionalism.</p>  </section>    <section>    <heading><h2>Ugly</h2></heading>    <p>The situation described in the review becomes further disconcerting with the alleged revelation that the visit was under false pretenses, claiming an appraisal that apparently was not performed. Such an accusation, if accurate, would expose unethical practices by Soria Real Estate and raise serious questions about their business integrity. Given that other local professionals are implied to be aware of a negative reputation associated with the representative involved, this could suggest broader professional repercussions for the company within the industry.</p>    <p>In this article's aim to provide detail, it is crucial to mention that the company has not responded to the user review. The lack of owner response could indicate a missed opportunity to address and potentially rectify the situation, or at the very least provide their perspective. This absence of engagement with feedback might influence prospective clients' perceptions of the company's dedication to customer satisfaction and reputation management.</p>  </section></article>"
