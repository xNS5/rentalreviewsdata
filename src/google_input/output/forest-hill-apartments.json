Theyre awful people and will try to scam you.\n\nThis apartment complex is over 100 years old. Maintanence staff told me that there's so much wrong with the building, that it needs to be completely rennovated. All drainage is slow, hot water doesn't last long. Units are in awful condition and are falling apart.\n\nI've met a couple of my neighbors, they all got a unit that was completely different from the listing photos. All of them said they'll never rent from PLTA again.",

        "review": "I just moved out so I feel safe writing a review without PTLA retaliating against me. They're a filthy bunch of rats in human skin.\nThe rent is cheaper here for a reason... This place is AWFUL! Do not rent here. This building is so neglected, it should be condemned, salted, and burned to the ground.\n\nMy 1 bed 1 bath looked nothing like the photos on PLTA's website. It was run-down, dirty, had a giant, ugly water pipe running through my entire unit. They had me pay deposit and sign the lease before seeing the place...what a mistake.\nI tried to get a refund - they refused and ignored me.\nI tried to put in maintenance requests and asked for the place to be cleaned before I moved in - they ignored me.\nThey don't respond to any of my emails or phone calls - they know who I am and they try to hide from me. Cowards.\n\nThey're nothing but dirty dog scammers. How can anyone work for this company!? Am I expecting to get my deposit back? Nope. I expect them to take every cent because they're greedy sons of Lucifer.\n\nI will never rent from then AGAIN. And you, person who is reading this review, take my advice. Hide yo kids, hide yo money from PLTA. Find a better place to live. Don't rent from them no matter how desperate you are. I'd rather be HOMELESS then rent with PLTA. Best of luck with your apartment searching ~ ",
