        "review": "We rented a 3-bedroom 2nd floor apartment for 5 months while house-hunting. It was great to find a unit that we could rent by the month; also it was cat-friendly. We were the first occupants of the unit, after construction of the building. Having all solid surface flooring was nice, but there appeared to be no noise insulation at all behind the walls or between the floors. We could hear the showers running and toilets flushing from the 3rd floor apartment above us with amazing clarity. The neighbors above us had a dog and we could hear his claws scratching the floor when they played with him (we assume) inside. (We didn't hear all his \"pawsteps\" though.) The owners/residents had heavy footfalls and we *could* hear them walking. We tried our best to walk softly so we wouldn't bother the people below us but we don't know if we were successful. We didn't have any issues with maintenance, and the property management company (Landmark) was fine, with professional and helpful staff. No surprises with fees, etc. CenturyLink is pre-wired into the units for Internet/cable; as of the time we stayed there, no other provider was available in this building. We have no regrets about staying here but wouldn't want to be long-term residents.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>User reviews of Sophia Place Apartments recognize the pet-friendly environment as a major plus, highlighting that many residents have pets which contributes to a lively and animal-loving community. The availability of units on a month-to-month basis offers great flexibility, especially for those in transitional periods such as house hunting, making it an ideal temporary housing solution for some tenants.</p><p>The property's newness is also noted in reviews; some tenants have expressed satisfaction with being the first occupants in their units post-construction. Having solid surface flooring throughout the apartments is another attribute that has been appreciated for aesthetic reasons and ease of maintenance.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>The staff at the property management company, Landmark, is described by a user review as professional and helpful, which points to a well-managed property. Fee structures were transparent with no hidden charges, which provided a measure of trust and confidence in the management company.</p><p>Another advantage mentioned is the pre-wiring for CenturyLink Internet and cable services, which allows new residents to quickly set up these amenities without the hassle of extensive installations.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>One concern noted in user reviews is the issue of soundproofing. Residents have reported being able to clearly hear noises from neighboring units, including showers running, toilets flushing, and pet activities. Despite having a pet-friendly policy, the noise made by the animals in the building can be disruptive for some residents, showing a need for better noise insulation.</p><p>The absence of onsite personnel to address immediate concerns has also been highlighted as a downside. For instance, problems like overflowing garbage have been left unattended, causing inconvenience for residents and possibly affecting the overall cleanliness of the complex.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>This article could not supply detailed experiences under this section due to the limited number of reviews available. However, the frequency and degree of the mentioned issues, such as noise complaints and maintenance neglect, could be significant enough to escalate them to the 'ugly' category if they persist without appropriate addressal by the property management.</p></section>"
