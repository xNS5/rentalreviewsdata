        "review": "Amazing agent. Joell worked with me and my family for about a year helping us find the perfect home. She was always available no matter the time of day. She answered all my questions,( even the ridiculous ones) and if she didn't have the answer she had the resources to get the answers and she used them. Joell always treated me and my family as a priority which made the whole experience priceless. It's not often you find someone so willing to fight for you especially when there's not much in it for them. Joell was and is a true blessing for me and my family. She steared me in all the right directions from building my credit to the right lending company. We thank her for all her dedication and hard work and all her knowledge. *****",

        "review": "My Fiance and I had been looking for a house for close to 3 years without any luck. Once we were introduced to JoEll we now had an agent that had our best interests in mind as well as not trying to push us into something that wouldn't work. Because of everything JoEll did we were able to find something that fit us as well as close on it faster than our loan agent said we could. If you want honest answers and a person who does everything in her skill set to get you where you want, look no further then JoEll!",

        "review": "She is awesome!!! Extremely nice, very relatable and genuinely cares. I was first time buyer and decided not to buy in the area but still talk to her. Most agents are very robotic and just care about money, this gal does what she can to make sure everyone gets to complete their home buying dreams. She helped my grandparents get into a home they never even thought was possible for them to get. If you are a first time buyer in this area, this gal will do what she can with her heart of gold",
