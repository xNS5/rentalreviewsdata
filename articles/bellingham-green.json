        "review": "We lived at Bellingham Green for one year (it was transitional for us after a move from out of the area until we purchased a house). Our experience was great! The townhouse was beautiful, tons of natural light from windows on 3 sides. A beautiful wooded area is to one side of the property, with a family of resident deer. Neighbors were friendly and respectful. Danny and Samantha are the owner and property manager, respectively, and were super easy to work with, very responsive and worked with us on our home buying timeline. This is one of very few pet friendly complexes in the area, so there are a lot of dogs (we have one too, that's one reason we chose to live there). There are dog waste stations located on the property and it's close to a couple walking trails. Community garden area is very nice amenity. The one drawback is the proximity to Bakerview Rd - it can get pretty noisy at times.\nWe love our new house, but if we found ourselves in need of an apartment, we would definitely call Samantha!",

        "review": "I wanted to share my pleasurable experience of living at Bellingham Green for the past year. Samantha and Danny were easy to work with and always responsive to any needs or concerns I had which were few if any. I appreciated the fact that they were dog friendly especially with a 76 lb lab which was not easy to find in Bellingham.nowadays The majority of places had so many restrictions but not them they worked with me and had no issue with my request. Also, their rental rates were fair and reasonable for such a nice apartment complex. I highly recommend Bellingham Green as a place to stay.",

However, the absence of diverse reviews means that potential issues may not have been publicly documented, leaving a gap in information that future tenants might find critical.</p><p>Furthermore, without any concrete negative feedback, it is difficult to ascertain the underlying issues that might exist. Tenants are encouraged to approach with realistic expectations and to conduct thorough research to ensure their needs will be met based on their unique lifestyle. This absence of heavy criticism can be seen as a positive, but it's equally essential to acknowledge that every property has room for improvement.</p></section>"
