        "review": "I don't wanna make a long review so here's a bullet list somewhat in order of worst to least worst parts of my experience here: \n- SO HOT. no ac with floor to ceiling windows. ac in the hallways tho???\n- parking is SO expensive. for what? i thought this was student housing \n- bad experiences w/ the ppl I have talked to on the phone \n- terribly built - random gaps in the cupboards where cats heads can get stuck. also, random paint splatters all over the floor. not that big of a deal but so annoying \n- i lived in a 4 bedroom, and one of them is wayyyyy bigger than the other three (almost 3x) and this was not advertised when we toured/signed lease. the person doesn't pay more rent \n- i lived in the smaller building, at least one washer/dryer was out of order almost always \n- stove and microwave suckkkkk\ndon't get me wrong, this place is beautiful and i was super grateful to be able to live there, but these are the things that gave me difficulties and think that stateside could improve! i would rather my expensive rent go to ac so my pets and I aren't roasting, rather than activities that I can't even attend due to my school or work schedule",

          "text": "Than you for your evaluation and ultimate appreciation of the community, Abbi. We do our best to help residents find cooling options as we're not built with central A/C, and we apologize this was a breaking point for you. Parking in downtown is very expensive at any complex accommodating a garage, and we do what we can to keep it competitive while also bearing in mind student budgets. Your note about the room sizes will definitely be taken into account for our team, as well as addressing phone call courtesy. We'd also be happy to help repair any downed appliance if notified. If there's anything else you'd like to share with our team, we're always available to you. Thanks again, Abbi."

        "review": "The employees were very friendly and the common areas were well-maintained. The bedrooms are very small, but there is a lot of storage space throughout the apartments. The windows only open about 6 inches from the bottom and there is no ventilation. It was unlivable in the summer and I had to couch surf because it was consistently at 95 degrees inside. There was also horrible chemical smells from high-VOC building materials. \n\nThe offsite parking is far away, expensive, and dangerous. I was put in quite a few bad situations while parking there, and my car was vandalized...twice. \n\nUpon moving out I spent days cleaning and left the apartment spotless.  Days later they sent everyone I know who was moving out a threatening email demanding at least $200. They managed to swindle over $1000 for carpet cleaning and a little repainting from me and my roommates. However, carpet cleaning is a move-in fee!",

          "text": "Thank you so much for providing us with your feedback about living at Stateside, Wren. When residents move out, we have to ensure that apartments are given to the next resident in a condition theyre comfortable moving into. This is often a higher level of cleanliness than the apartments are left to us in, and we saw this primarily with paint and carpet cleaning this turn. Photos and final account statement insight were emailed to you in October related to your concerns about the charges, but if you need to discuss further we are happy to do so over the phone. Stateside does not have any move-in fees that would include any kind of cleaning, so unsure as to what you're referencing there. We have not heard any complaints about chemical smells from the building materials, so please clarify where this odor was represented most if you could. Our off-site parking is managed by the City of Bellingham and they provide 24/7 security and monitoring. Any concerns or circumstances involved with that amenity should be properly reported so that the proper authorities can conduct an investigation. As this merely serves as a review response, we do hope that you understand we're trying to communicate effectively about the elements of your review, though would love for any further discourse to occur over the phone or in-office if the opportunity allows. Thank you again for your time, Wren."

        "review": "I (tried) living here but quickly found it to be 80% a total money scheme directed at pet owners and students / 20% an actual space to rent equitably. \n\nThis place is largely geared towards a demographic of people who haven't rented before and simply do not know any better in terms of how the process gives and takes; it's an exchange between tenant and landlord.\n\nIn the case with Stateside, the narrative handed down from day 1 is that \"we are your dystopian overlords until your lease is up.\" \n\nI moved there because it was the only dog friendly, affordable option in Bellingham, sight unseen from NY because I wanted to start a new life there. Everything seemed nice and the staff seemed willing to help and communicate well throughout the whole process...so long as the concerns didn't in any way actually translate to addressing a real issue. That's because the people running the show here are under qualified, underpaid, and overworked, in conjunction with a business model that slightly resembles a pyramid scheme.\n\nThings seemed fine until a sprinkler system busted in the neighboring apartment, flooding the whole hallway at 3am and evacuating the building. According to a press release emailed to the residents, it was because a student had placed lights near the sprinkler head but upon asked my neighbor about it who lived in the same apartment, I was informed that there were actually no lights present on her ceiling and that she was receiving some form of compensation for keeping it on the hush. IE THEY CHEAPED OUT ON THE FIRE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND THEN BLAMED A STUDENT SCAPEGOAT WHEN IT FAILED\n\nI come home from work the next day, no communication, no warning that my apartment was going to be entered, to 150 decibel air fans and dehumidifiers strewn throughout the place (6 total) and took them out. \n\nYou can't sign the lease without them having the explicit right to relocate you at any time, and for me, after I took the fans out, they threatened me with just that if I didn't just be a good little boy and capitulate to terrible landlord practices that make the idea of having a piece of mind obsolete in this scenario. \n\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE NOT LANDLORDS, THEY ARE DYSTOPIAN ALGORITHMS TRYING TO VACUUM YOUR MONEY.\n\nI left 6 months ago because I couldn't get a response to replace my door handle that my dog had figured out how to open when I was at work, making the apartment no long feasible since my roommates were uninterested in allowing him to roam the common area or properly storing trash so he can't get to it. The apartment was no longer feasibly dog friendly at that point. \n\nA few days ago I got a bill from a collections agency for the rest of the sum of rent for AFTER they wouldn't address my dog's concerns! 7k\n\nThis was after PLEADING with the manager to let me out of my lease because it was completely shady.\n\nI urge anybody considering this place as a living option to keep looking in your search and to try to find the least built up organization possible to rent from. \n\nUnscrupulous, predatory, business model.",

          "text": "Maxwell, unfortunately, due to vacating your apartment before the lease was over, we had no other choice but to send your account to collections as required by Washington state law. As you know, we reached out a number of times to discuss matters, including the door handle issue, but you left before it could be addressed in a timely manner. Regarding the fire sprinkler incident, this was due to a plant hanging from it, and to accommodate residents affected by the minor flooding, not only did our maintenance team act swiftly, we also provided gifts cards for the inconvenience, of which you received. If you would like to discuss this further, our management team is happy to provide whatever details you need."

        "review": "Stateside overcharges college students. parking went from less than $100/mo for the first year of leases to $350/month for the upcoming year. I live in a 4 bedroom and the rent will increase to $1000/mo after I leave. Absolute trash. The furniture is cheap, the online rent pay has a $20 charge (which is why i use cashier's checks). \n\nThe most frustrating of all is Stateside does raffles, giveaways, \"workshops\" and events for residents that NOBODY ASKED FOR. This is why they charge so much in rent, to give a handful of residents a smoothie or a plant every single month. I'm one of the many residents who would rather be charged less in rent and just live in my own space and not get bothered by stupid raffles every month. No, I don't give two shits about a \"pool party\" for dogs or a coffee bar where the machine craps out every week. Stop spending our rent money that way you unprofessional greedy idiots !",

We are truly sorry that the combined elements mentioned in your review have resulted in an overall negative sentiment, especially in regards to pricing fluctuations and events onsite. As a downtown Bellingham property, we are very limited to our currently sold-out parking spaces as we only have 90 spaces available in an area where, as you know, parking is extremely sparse. The events we offer have been well-received by most, as it's our effort to help build community within the walls we all inhabit, but we'd love more feedback from you or others on how we can best improve them to match your needs or better influence your lifestyle. We can also advise a way for you to avoid the larger charging fee for online payments moving forward. We know this only serves as a response online, so if we could, let's talk this week in-office about your review and any other components maybe unmentioned. Thank you again, Kiersten."

        "review": "Beware of off-site parking! \nMy daughter (Junior at WWU) signed a lease in May, 2021 for the 2021-2022 school year. At that time, the apartment building was not yet completely built and there were very few specifics available from Stateside (didn't know who roommates would be, etc.). She added an off-site parking space to her lease not knowing anything about it - but assuming it would be a reasonable distance away within a couple of blocks and it would be easier than having to constantly find street parking. \nThey did not provide complete information about the parking space (or cancellation policy) until move-in weekend in September. At that time she was told it was in an underground parking garage downtown (.6 miles away - and in the complete opposite direction of campus) and that she would have to move her car every 3 days. She does not feel safe in the parking garage when she's by herself - especially in the dark. \nShe immediately asked to cancel the space - and Stateside would not let her unless she can find another apartment resident to take the space over.  None of this information was spelled out in the lease at all, and once they had specific information they did not give her the option to opt out of that part of the contract. \nVery deceptive and very poor service especially for students who are likely signing a lease for the first time. \nMost other aspects of the apartment have gone well, but this is not unacceptible.",

        "review": "Stateside apartments has been extremely frustrating. Not really sure where to start. First of all, they have been terrible as far as the process of renewing goes. They have repeatedly threatened that our room isn't going to be available for the next leasing cycle (which is 6 months away) if we don't renew ASAP. Many of us are unsure about whether to renew, and these threats over email about taking our room away from us a half a year from the next lease don't help. They have been extremely shady overall about this stuff, claiming that they told us that our rent would go up, and then in turn raising our rent for the next leasing cycle over $100 a month, even though they never told us specifically that this rate would increase, and never contacted our guarantor about it. I am expected to pay $200 more than my roommate, for a smaller room in the same apartment, just because stateside feels like raising our rate because I haven't renewed yet, when again, the next lease isn't for MONTHS, and we had been planning on renewing. Stateside has also been awful about maintenance. They have now postponed their maintenance scheduled dates 3 or 4 times, on late notice, so we've been waiting around for them to do their inspections for weeks now, with little communication on when it'll actually happen. Stateside has also sent other threatening emails about fining their tenants for silly things that are not included in the leasing agreement. They have said that noise, not wearing masks, skateboarding inside and other small things will warrant a $100 fine from them, which is ridiculous. Overall a very vague, shady group that doesn't care about their tenants needs or opinions. If you're going to rent at stateside, keep all of the above in mind, and expect it to happen to you.",

The location is super convenient, especially for students, with easy access to campus and local amenities. The building is well-maintained, and the staff has always been friendly and responsive to any concerns or maintenance requests.\n\nThe amenities, like the gym and study lounges, are a nice touch, making it easy to balance work and relaxation. The apartments themselves are modern and spacious, with plenty of natural light, and Ive found the noise level to be pretty manageable, even in a busy student area. Fully-furnished apartments are quite nice as well. The only minus was the apartment was not fully cleaned upon move-in, so that took a bit of effort to get it really nice. And definitely recommend getting a 2 in.+ mattress topper as well, it is a lifesaver for a comfy bed.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid place to stay thats close to campus and has everything you need, Id definitely recommend Stateside!",

        "review": "Feels very corporate and pushy when it comes to leases. They started pushing renewing leasing in December which is slimy because everyone only just got settled. The longer you wait the more the lease rises. Horrible. The fact that you have to pay a ridiculous amount of money to use the parking garage when there is limited parking on the streets is absurd. They are just sucking people dry because they know peoples parents are paying for their college rooming. Sickening. The washers and dryers didnt work well. Never felt clean or they didnt drain properly so my stuff would be soaking, had to wring it out in the sink. I always had to add extra time to my dry time even after adding additional time to start the load. These loads ranged from big ones to small ones. There is also no wheelchair button on the laundry door which makes it inaccessible to those who need additional assistance or people with a big load. The mini market they put in was just another way to get peoples money which feels disgusting. Then they raised rent for next years people and I have a feeling thats got something to do with it. The quarterly room checks are crazy. This is an apartment, not a dorm. There is no reason that someone should be coming into my apartment without an invitation. No ac makes it really hard to live in during the summer. The building is so new that its stupid there is no ac except in the hallways. The location of the building makes it inconvenient for those that go to WWU. There is no bus that comes to that end of town so its inconvenient to go anywhere.\n\nI do not recommend living here.",

We do start renewal season early as the spots tend to fill up rather quickly at Stateside, and we'd like to give those living here the best chance at securing another year with us before opening it up to those who don't yet reside here. Understandably, that decision is not always easy to make so far out and there is nothing wrong with declining the renewal offers. This area as any local will tell you is extremely limited in parking, and we have to be both competitive and fair in our pricing for residents when it comes to what we have available. We do apologize for this inconvenience as we know it can be a hassle. If you're experiencing any issues with the washers/dryers, we can have a vendor look into this but want to follow process there and help you get a clean, dry load on the first time every time. For the micro market: we do not receive any revenue from that and the prices and revenue are set by the vendor. Our closest bus stop is 1 block away -  to campus, the bus stop is 4 blocks away. We can review the routes with you or anyone curious if need be as well. We know this serves as answers to some, but should prompt conversation for others and are happy to do so over the phone, in-office, via email - whatever works best.

Painting over a mark on the wall does require the whole unit to be repainted per your lease agreement.

The amenities are amazing- great gym, huge laundry rooms, kind staff, ect. The only critique I have is that when you first move in you are told that the apartment has been cleaned before you arrive, but when I moved in it was very clear what they meant by cleaning is just sweeping the floors.

We were charged the wrong amount of money on several occasions, and even though my son vacated his room two months before the end of the lease, we still had to pay for the full 12 months (which was expected).

        "review": "I lived here for a year and loved it...HOWEVER...I moved out in June and its now October and they are just now doing their move out walkthroughs and charging me $300+. When I moved in the place was DISGUSTING and I had to spend a full day scrubbing each inch of the place. The bathroom reeked of pee and the kitchen was so so gross with food waste. Now, they are charging me for the toilet being slightly dirty (Mind you it sat for 2 months...) the bathroom fan being dusty (it would get like that after a few weeks) and UNDER the oven being dirty (they literary pulled out the oven drawer which I never used because it was so gross from the previous tennant). They are also charging me for small holes left in the wall, some of which were there when I moved in, and this is after I even asked if I could put nails in the wall and they said yes just dont be excessive about it. Really really disapointed with how they are charging me so much money for things that happen when you wait this long to do walk throughs, especially given the condition of the place when I moved in...because I highly doubt they actually use my money to clean the place.",

        "review": "Stateside has no AC. This is normal for single-family homes in the PNW, and Im relatively used to it. However, this did not prepare me whatsoever for stateside in summer. Especially on the upper floors, add 10-15 degrees to the heat outside and thats what it will be in your apartment, at least. Most air conditioners are also not comparable with statesides windows, you will need a floor-standing one. Essentially: it gets dangerously hot here in summer, i really cant recommend this building to anyone but especially not those with any chronic health concerns like me. I could not stay here during the hottest days of the year without endangering my health, and in my opinion building a new place like this with no temp control while summers get hotter every year was a mistake. I also know of many other residents who have couch surfed or gone home for summers only because of the heat. its basically unlivable.",

          "text": "Thank you for your insight, Nico. We definitely can experience some hotter summers in the PNW, and would be happy to share some in-unit A/C models that would fit your space best since some of our staff has also purchased them for their own occupancy. If there is ever a threat heath-wise based on the heat, we would be happy to discuss this with you as we're not aware of any situation like that until it's brought to our attention. We do appreciate your feedback and perspective on this matter, and invite you to continue this chat with us this weekend or next week if you'd like. "

Several users cited frustration over being charged excessively for everyday amenities like parking, which reached up to $350 monthly\u2014a steep increase from previous rates. Other users pointed out that while the apartments are beautiful, the building issues such as thin walls and inadequate ventilation have been problematic, particularly during the hotter months without AC.</p><p>Difficulty with communication and cumbersome management practices have also been a source of discontent for several residents. Some users reported feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to renew leases with substantial price hikes without adequate notice or clarity. Additionally, instances where users were charged hefty fees for minor damages or uncleanliness that pre-existed their tenancy were highlighted, casting doubt on the fairness and transparency of these charges.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>In the more severe user reviews, there are accounts of mismanagement and unsettling experiences that have deeply affected certain tenants' views of Stateside. One former resident alleged that the management\u2019s primary focus seemed to be monetary, often imposing unreasonable fines for what they deemed were trivial infractions. The lack of proper handling of maintenance issues, particularly elevator malfunctions that were only temporarily addressed, added to the residents\u2019 frustration.</p><p>Reports of exploitation through unexpected bills and unauthorized entries into apartments have also surfaced, leading to significant mistrust. Residents who felt their complaints were not adequately addressed, or those who felt financially tuned were particularly disillusioned, suggesting a culture of poor communication and customer service. These experiences, unfortunately, overshadow the potential benefits and have resulted in stern warnings from past residents to potential newcomers about the management practices at Stateside.</p></section>"
