Claimed a screen was missing when it was in the garage. Handed me the Without cleaning it and now wants to bill me seven hours for cleaning it at the end. No one is in their office on the weekends and they expect Im supposed to wait until Monday to return the keys. The bare minimum contact I had was with Kashia DeMerice who provided zero support.",

        "review": "Do not rent from Optimus. They work with a verbally abusive and threatening property owner named Iva Smetana who lives in Ferndale. She owns the apartments at Eagle Pkwy in Ferndale, under the name Smetana 1 LLC, which is publicly available information on the assessors website. At least several former tenants have witnessed her be cruel to a disabled person, and yell at a mother in front of her children, and Iva calls the cops on tenants if they put too much in the dumpster. She will be looking through the dumpster with a flashlight late at night to find out who it was. Optimus has always done her bidding, posting notes on doors when shed get mad and tell them to. They probably dont stand up to her because theyre afraid of her too. Do not rent from Optimus. Anyone who cant stand up to Iva shouldnt be operating a property management business. And, if you value your safety, DO NOT MOVE TO EAGLE PKWY.",

        "review": "They are a-holes, lack social skills when dealing with tenants. They don't solve simple problems that take very little effort. The trash is constantly everywhere can't even walk in that area to toss it, very hazardous. Take long time to respond to time sensitive problems or basic maintenance. They are running out the long time tenants with rent increases every year and a ton of legal paperwork just to maintain a lease, but you will never hear from them unless it's a mean text talking down on tenants like we're children.",

After move out, they charged me $175 for 4 electric stove drip pans, and an $80 cleaning fee when the place was spotless. There were two tiny spots on the wall that needed touch ups. Stay away from these people and avoid the headache. Kashia was my property manager.",

Keisha is the worst person to work with she is very unprofessional she doesn't have any communication skills. I have been sending in request for repairs for over three years and they tried to make it seem like it was our fault. Never rent from Optimus Property Solutions. They wrongfully evicted us we our disabled and we were behind on rent. I refuse to pay rent for filth and black mold. We our now homeless because of Optimus Property Solutions. They should be called Optimus Property destroyers .",

They sync up with our team like a dream. And kindness? Double check. When tech gremlins attacked, they didn't just stand by; they dove into the trenches with us, showing patience and support that would make your grandma proud.\n\nBut it's not all serious business. Their team has a way of making even the driest property management talk feel like a chat over coffee. They've mastered the art of being pros while keeping it light and human, which in my book, makes them property management rockstars. If you're on the hunt for a property management crew that brings both brains and heart to the table, along with a few laughs, look no further than Optimus Property Solutions. They're not just managing properties; they're elevating the game.\"",

        "review": "Response time is considerably slow once you become a tenant.  Almost as if you are intentionally being ignored.  However, when washer and dryer didn't work to complete a single load, service was contacted immediately.  When the dryer was identified as non-repairable, a new one of a similar model was ordered and delivered within 3 days.  Housekeeping/ cleaning service hired to clean the home prior to move-in date did a horrible job.  They should find a different cleaning company.",

        "review": "We've had our ups and down  (who hasn't with property management at a mobile home park?) but when it comes down to it, Julia has been an understanding and reasonable property manager, and not to mention, kind. She is always calm and clear with her expectations and that is vital as sometimes emotions can run a little high if issues arise! She is definitely very good at her job in that way, I can truly attest to that. I think lots of the issues we've dealt with in our park have been outside of the scope of Optimus' management of the park. While that's been hard to navigate, it's not their fault. She has shown that she cares and is willing to work with people, especially us. We know that she didn't need to be as understanding and patient as she has been with us over the years, and since our livelihood literally depends on it, we are grateful to her for sure.",

        "review": "Be careful if you rent a property through Optimus. They charged us $315 of our security deposit for \"general cleaning\" despite that we left the property spotless. The lease allowed cleaning only if we left the property dirty and we provided an extensive number of photos proving the property did not need cleaning (we spent hours scrubbing the house and leaving it clean). We asked them what needed to be cleaned by them and they were unable to answer that and said that since the cleaners were already paid there is no way to refund us. I would not rent through them again given what feels like a deceptive and dishonest business practice.",

I'll say as soon as that happened my rent went up $200 and I'll say Julia was the worst person you can ever communicate with. We finally found a house we bought and gave them a notice of vacancy. Recently Julia came by  and was taking pictures of the house and my wife asked what's going on thinking it was the HOA. Unfortunately the reply my wife gets is \" mind your own f@#$ business\". So my wife takes a few pictures of her just in case and Julia stops her truck, sticks her head out and rudely shouts \"you want me to get  out and pose?\"  I then called and headed to the office to have a conversation with Gary I believe..by the time I arrived office was closed and no one was there @1pm.. interesting how 10 minutes was a hard time to wait for me to arrive? Since then I haven't had a phone call back or no answers of why Julias actions were so unprofessional and rude.",
