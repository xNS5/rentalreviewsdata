      "review": "Awful management.  Just look at high numbers of 1 and 2 star reviews.  The concern I had was so poorly managed I wonder if the property owner know or care about the renters' dissatisfaction?  Or perhaps the same ownership.  If you manage student housing where many remote parents send monthly payments, why not offer ACH direct bank deposit instead of expensive 2.85% credit card payment method?  RPM also accepts Bill Pay but that's not always reliable as physical mail can, and do get lost.  Why make it so difficult to make payments while charging 10% late fee?  The payment method is antiquated at best, but the real issue is how the RPM manages concerns.",

      "review": "I lived here for the 2019-2020 school year and in that time our apartment flooded twice. My roommate and I had to hound them to take action, and never gave us a confirmation that there was no mold damage. The apartments themselves are look worn in and not worth the price, they took 1/2 of our deposit and up-charged us for cleaning and replacements. Like the other reviews say, Gustavo is truly the best part of this place always reliable and went above and beyond to help us with our flooding.",

      "review": "Been living in the New England Apartments for about 5 months, and I know we will not be returning next year. The apartments aren't bad, for factoring in price and proximity to campus (as I am a student). But there have been multiple incidents with the staff at RPM being unorganized (like forgetting that we had paid our rent and going as far as sending us emails that we would be charged late fees, for example). The parking is an ABSOLUTE FRICKIN NIGHTMARE, and is the primary reason as to why we are leaving. 80% of the spots are so small that you can only park in if you don't expect to get out of your car - and on top of that, it's not regulated, so it's cool that it's free, but I'd honestly rather pay to have a guaranteed spot for my car. On top of that, when cars are parked incorrectly (e.g. taking up multiple spots) for several days, they will usually get called in to RPM, someone will come tape a sign saying that they've taken your information and need to move your car or it will be towed, basically. This happened to someone in my time here. You know how long it took RPM to tow their car after they put the sign on it? LONGER THAN A MONTH. (It deserved to be towed because at this point it had been there at least a week before someone called it in, and had the sign on the car for a very long time. The only reason they get 2 stars is for the okay-ness of the apartments and the AWESOME maintenance guy, Gustavo. If anything ever breaks, or sometimes is even just old, Gus will just go ahead and replace it for you. RPM - I hope you give him a raise, he's very kind and is great at what he does.",

      "review": "Best place Ive rented in Bellingham. Clean and spacious apartments, maintence is prompt and the staff in the office are very helpful. I recently broke my foot and they were quick to accommodate me with parking to make my life 10000% easier, which they did not have to do (Bev you are the best!!). I am extremely grateful and so happy that Im renting with a company that is so helpful to its tenants. Everything is simple when dealing with the office when it comes to things such as lease transfers, maintence requests, and anything else really. Always been happy with the company. Only negatives is that the complex Im renting out has tight parking- however this is almost entirely due to college students not knowing how to park between the lines, and limited office hours.",

      "review": "In my experience, RPM consistently missed any expectations or standards a realty company should be held to. The company knows they can charge asinine fees to unknowing college students and not suffer any consequences, outside of their universally poor public image. In my year with them we encountered false police/noise reports with $100 fees tacked on, water damage from a burst water heater, (which was much more catastrophic to other units in our building and without any compensation or apology on the part of RPM.) As well as a general lack of responsiveness to basic maintenance issues. The rent prices are exorbitant for the quality of service and housing provided and I would highly suggest taking business elsewhere.",
