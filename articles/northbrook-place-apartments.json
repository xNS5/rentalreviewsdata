I waited over a year for a maintenance request on a garage and some kids kicked a hole through the wall because it was fun. The garage cost me $100 a month versus the with apartment as advertised. My rooms were stolen and my vehicle towed by the city parking in the overflow where advised by property management. If you own pets expect blanket notification saying you were seeing not picking up your dog's waste regardless of whether you do or do not. They're trying to do everything they can to polish it up but attitude and community are still reflective of being directly across from a homeless community..",

The pet policy here is very good. You can only have two, but who needs more in an apartment? If you're looking for a place to live and you have pets, kids, come here. (There may be weight/breed restrictions on certain dogs I'm not sure.)",

        "review": "I have lived at Northbrook for 25 years. It's not a bad place. Very quiet despite fact that Bennett Drive is  the road right in front. It's close to the airport but very little nose. The manager Joy is great. Friendly and upbeat. If you have the attitude that you want to work with her things will get done. Maint         guy is good and reliable. He gets repairs done quickly. (He even unclogs my bathroom sink. I have very long hair.) My neighbors are  nice and friendly.  Less than a mile from Fred Meyer and close to Bellis Fair and the freeway on ramp going both north and south.",
