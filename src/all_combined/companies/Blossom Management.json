      "review": "When I first found an art studio in Bellingham, it was downtown, right on Holly Street, across from the YMCA. That space worked well for a few months yet ended up not quite fitting my needs. So I looked for a new place to establish my studio. \n\nLow and behold I discovered Workstudios! What a wonderful space to setup an art and design studio! Clean, well lit, newer fixtures, excellent location, customer parking lot and separate tenant lot, and a whole slew of perks such as a very well maintained conference room one can rent when needed. Most importantly, they lease high quality units at reasonable rates.\n\nWhat a friendly team of people managing it too! Thank you Debbie Turk and everyone else for being such awesome people to work with. I highly recommend Blossom Management to anyone else looking to set up a small business in Bellingham.",
