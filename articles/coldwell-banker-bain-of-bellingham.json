        "review": "Erika Smith is the most professional and kind realtor Ive ever met. She helped me to sell my beloved home of 26 years and purchase my new home while grieving the recent loss of my spouse. I was confused about many steps of the process, but she gently and kindly assisted me throughout with genuine care, spot on professional advice and understanding. She went above and beyond checking in with me and offering assistance with the complicated decisions of downsizing my home and preparing my home for sale. My family and I are very grateful to her for working so diligently to get the best prices for both my old and new homes. Erika is an excellent realtor who gracefully knows how to navigate the complex realty business while demonstrating care and respect for clients complicated needs. My family and I highly recommend Ms Erika Smith of Coldwell Banker Bain.",

        "review": "Working with Max Kwiatkowski and Matia Schwartz was an absolute dream come true. As a first-time homebuyer, I was completely lost - but they held my hand through every step of the process with patience, kindness, and a level of expertise that put my mind at ease. No matter how many questions my family threw their way, Max and Matia were always there with clear, comforting answers.\n\nBut their support went far beyond just explaining the process. They were our fierce advocates, using their magic touch to secure us an unbeatable deal on our move-in ready home - a staggering $16,000 off the asking price, practically unheard of in Whatcom! At every turn, they had our backs, working tirelessly to ensure we got the absolute best possible outcome.\n\nThe impact of Max and Matia's help cannot be overstated. With their guidance and our lender's support, they literally changed our lives for the better. We wouldn't be in our new home without them. I can't recommend Max and Matia enough - if we ever move or sell in the future, I wouldn't dream of working with anyone else. From the bottom of my heart, thank you both for everything you do.",

        "review": "Our realtor went way, way above and beyond his responsibilities to provide us with excellent first class service! He took care of all our needs and made it a real pleasure, even when things went sideways, and we were worried about the sale. He stepped up and took care of everything! I would recommend Chuck Occhigrosso to everyone to sell their home, in a heartbeat. He is truly a man of honor and great integrity!",

        "review": "We worked with Ann Cantrell and Derek Buse to sell our home in Bellingham.  While they are both kind and friendly people, we were very disappointed with the sale overall.  In the initial listing, they made some errors, including the amount of rent charged for our lower unit and the type of heating in the home.\n\nWe were impressed by their marketing reach, but found that we had many questions along the way that went unanswered.  After receiving an offer, we found that Derek advised us to continue lowering the price again and again even in the final stages of negotiation.  He was less and less responsive the closer it got to closing; it almost seemed like the brokers were doing all the negotiating without our being included in the conversation.\n\nWhen they were courting our business, Derek and Ann gave the impression we might get close to our initial listing price, but ultimately we ended up receiving a significantly lower amount.  We wish we had gone with Monte Young, who helped us buy our home originally, because he always took the time to answer questions and he gave us a realistic idea of what to expect every step of the way.",

        "review": "I can't imagine a better realtor than Coldwell Banker's Jeff Braimes. He has that great combination of professionalism and sincere friendliness. His ethics through a myriad of selling and buying situations were impeccable. He dealt collaboratively with other realtors, banks, builders, inspectors, etc. He clearly has experience and exceptional skill in all of the challenging turns that occur in real estate transactions. He helped us find the right buyer at the right price for our home, and then spent endless hours exploring a very wide and constantly changing variety of buy options for us. We learned a lot and by the time the right home came up, we were prepared to move. We are moving in this week, and still Jeff stays in direct contact to help keep things moving smoothly. Couldn't be more pleased and grateful for having met Jeff.",

I have owned 12 parcels of land over the years, and I know what agents are like.  She is light-years above the average and/or median.   Proactive, aggressive in getting the fest deal financially, immediate follow-up on any unresolved issues, and committed to client satisfaction.  She is a thorough professional and a credit to BainCB.",

My primary concern was that my personal relationship with the seller would be preserved and the utmost of respect would be provided for maintaining the integrity of this relationship.  Charly did a fantastic job earning the trust of the seller and at the same time protecting me as the buyer.  Great diplomacy!  I would recommend Charly to anyone.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Coldwell Banker Bain of Bellingham has garnered positive feedback from a number of users who highlight the professionalism and dedication of their realtors. For example, one tenant praised an agent for her ability to guide them through the complexities of selling their home after a significant personal loss, demonstrating exceptional care and kindness throughout the process. This sentiment of proactive support can be seen across multiple reviews, where agents are recognized for being knowledgeable and going the extra mile to ensure clients feel comfortable and informed.</p><p>Another theme evident in the user reviews is the willingness of agents to provide continuous support even after the sale. Several reviewers noted that their agents maintained contact and provided assistance after transactions were completed, reassuring clients that they were there for them during the entire journey. Overall, this consistent professionalism and the courteous approach of the staff contribute greatly to the positive perception of Coldwell Banker Bain in the local community.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The experiences shared by users regarding their real estate transactions with Coldwell Banker Bain are overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding the capabilities of individual agents. For instance, multiple users expressed immense gratitude toward their realtors for securing great deals, such as significantly below asking prices. One user specifically noted receiving $16,000 off their first home, which showcases the agents' dedication to not just facilitating sales but also advocating strongly for their clients' financial interests.</p><pMoreover, agents have been commended for their excellent communication. First-time homebuyers spoke highly of the patience exhibited by their agents, who guided them through each step of the often daunting process. This level of engagement and support plays a crucial role in fostering trust and satisfaction among clients, which has made Coldwell Banker Bain a reputable choice for real estate services in the area.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><pWhile there are numerous commendations for Coldwell Banker Bain, some users have expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of their experiences. One user recounted a challenging encounter when they felt that important questions about the sale of their home went unanswered, indicating a perceived lack of responsiveness from the agents involved. Despite the friendly demeanor of the agents, this review raised concerns about errors in the initial listing and communication issues during negotiations.</p><pAdditionally, another reviewer reflected on their overall disappointment in the transaction process, feeling that they were excluded from negotiations and misled about pricing expectations. These moments of disconnect can certainly impact the overall perception of the company, highlighting the need for improvement in communication and engagement with clients throughout the sales process.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pA particularly troubling instance arose when a user reported their experience with an agent, leading the company to respond defensively. The company asserted that the dissatisfaction expressed in the review did not correlate with any of their agents' actions and requested that the review be retracted. This situation underscores a potential issue with customer service in handling grievances, as the reviewer felt invalidated and unsupported in their feedback.</p><pSuch defensiveness may cast a shadow over Coldwell Banker Bain\u2019s otherwise strong reputation, as it implies a reluctance to acknowledge and rectify problematic situations that clients may encounter. This reaction could deter potential clients who seek a property management company that is willing to address complaints transparently and constructively, highlighting the importance of consistent and empathetic communication even in challenging reviews.</p></section>"
