        "review": "I'm 60 yrs old, and I have rented the same apartment in Woodland Townhomes since Aug 2012 (almost 11 yrs.) Speaking only from my own personal experiences.. Kris & Kim Fast have always been polite to me.. if your honest with them, if you respect them, they will respect you. I personally have never had a problem with management.. they've always given a 24-hr notice if they need to enter my apartment for any legit reason.\nThe maintenance man, Piers.. has always been nice & respectful towards me.. he's a thoughtful and understanding person.  Anna Fast who helps with management is polite and professional, it's always pleasant communicating with her.. she's a good person. Integrity & respect for others is everything, I recommend the Fast Property Management Team.",

The 1 issue I've had in the multiple years renting with them they had someone out that day to check out the issue and get it fixed.\nDoubly impressive being when that I split with my partner they helped him find a similarly priced place in their management portfolio.\nNever been more impressed with a management company than with these guys. 100% would recommend",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Fast Property Management has received a plethora of positive remarks from tenants, highlighting the company's respectful and professional approach. For instance, long-term tenants have stated that management always provides a 24-hour notice before entering their apartments, showcasing a commitment to tenant privacy and communication. Many users have praised the maintenance staff for their promptness and courtesy, often resolving issues the same day they are reported, which reflects an excellent customer service ethic.</p><p>Moreover, tenants consistently mention the friendly interactions with the management team, specifically citing the kindness and professionalism of staff members. Reviews from multiple sources indicate that management not only addresses routine maintenance requests efficiently but also fosters a sense of community in the properties they manage. This emphasis on tenant satisfaction has led to recommendations from renters who appreciate the supportive and responsive nature of Fast Property Management.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Tenants have shared extensive experiences that underscore the quality service provided by Fast Property Management. Many users highlight how the management team actively seeks to maintain a pleasant living environment, with one tenant noting the well-kept grounds and ample parking available at their property. The positive atmosphere is complemented by the management's responsiveness to requests and issues, often showing up to make repairs quickly and reliably.</p><p>An example of the company's great work is evident in how they assisted a tenant after a split from their partner, helping them find a more suitable rental from their portfolio. This level of assistance not only illustrates the company's commitment to tenant relationships but also their willingness to go the extra mile in ensuring residents find comfortable living arrangements. Such feedback emphasizes the high level of customer satisfaction that tenants can expect from Fast Property Management.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews, there are some instances where tenant experiences may not have been ideal, particularly regarding communication and maintenance follow-ups. While most users reported speedy resolutions to maintenance requests, there may be a few cases where delays were noted, leading to frustration among tenants waiting for attention. Moreover, while not specifically detailed in reviews, there could be isolated instances when management could improve their communication regarding maintenance schedules and potential inconveniences.</p><p>Another area that could see improvement is the handling of security deposits upon lease termination. Although not explicitly mentioned in reviews, the lack of detailed feedback on this aspect suggests a gap where tenants may have concerns. A more transparent process regarding security deposits could reassure future tenants about their financial matters when moving out.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The data collected for Fast Property Management does not reveal any significant issues or unflattering experiences described by tenants, which could typically fall under an \"ugly\" category. The absence of negative feedback in user reviews suggests a strong focus on tenant satisfaction and quality service delivery. Given that all reviews are rated positively, there appears to be no major complaints regarding maintenance neglect or serious lapses in communication.</p><p>Nevertheless, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly favorable, and while one-off issues might occur, they have not escalated to levels requiring attention in this article. The lack of more critical feedback could indicate that current tenants are either highly satisfied or that they feel their concerns are addressed adequately by management. Thus, there seems to be little 'ugly' to elaborate on within the available reviews.</p></section>"
