        "review": "Tullwood is not a bad place to live. It's quieter than most apts as it's away from roads and cinder block construction lessens any noise from common walls. Neighbors are friendly and helpful if you make an effort and reciprocate. Management is responsive and fair minded. It's a bargain given the square footage and amenities compared to most apartments in the area. And the security is good. Never saw the nearby homeless inside the complex. If you can live with occasional smoke from them and less than pristine hallways/stairways (all apts struggle to keep common areas clean) it is a nice place to live. Minor inconveniences given the advantage of Walmart next door.",

Amy who goes beyond her daily duties to make sure the tenants are well taken care of and safe. She's very strong with her job and holds the ground to keep her tenants safe. Honest and reliable. She Works very well in a timely matter to address any problems that may arise. For the price and how nice these apartments are and the wonderful people who live there I would recommend.",

(carrying up large packages,  watching out for my daughter, answering my questions quickly and helping us resolve leasing and key issues quickly)  I feel so much better knowing I can reach out to him.  I visited recently and while there could be some improvements in some areas I felt much better and at ease knowing Dan was there to help!  Thank you for doing all you can and fighting for the residents!",

        "review": "Love living here. Amy is the sweetest most awesome building manager ever. They are incredibly nice and work with you about pets. The buildings are armed so you have to buzz in. The walls are super thick so you almost never hear your side neighbors a little noise from upstairs but thats to be expected. There is a homeless camp behind this building but they keep adding more security to keep us safe which I appreciate. Not to pricey for the size either.",

        "review": "There is a homeless community right outside the fences of the apartments. They never interfere physically with the activities of those living inside, but nearly EVERY NIGHT, you can hear them arguing, screaming, and sometimes even SHOOTING GUNS while those inside try to live their normal day to day lives. Then, once you get past that, there's the fog, the faulty fire alarms, the dirty and poorly kept stairs and elevators, and a locked \"bathroom\" that is in the ground floor hallway, for whatever reason. (Even though all of the apartments have actual bathrooms.)\n\nThe streets around it are filled with boring malls, a complete lack of sidewalks, and the occasional road kill. At least the food close by is affordable. But even then, it's not worth going out for a walk unless you like forests full of trash. Or boring parking lots. Literally, these apartments are here solely to crash in if you can't afford to live closer to the center of the city.\n\nThis part of town probably used to be a beautiful forest a few decades ago, but now it's just the wastebin of snobby capitalists and starving hobos. I would give Tullwood Apartments a 3 normally, but the boring gray shopping \"district\" and the constant yelling from homeless (including as I write this right now) makes this barely a 2. I'd probably give it a 1.5 if I could. There's literally a car stuffed full of an old homeless ladies' junk in the parking lot, and nobody cares. I am very tired.",

I have plenty of space in my unit; a washer and dryer in an actual laundry room, a large bathroom, etc. Plus it's pet friendly! I like that any store I need is just a couple minute drive. Any complaints I have, don't have anything to do with the unit or the management. Amy is making sure the area is safe and walks the property often, and I appreciate what she does for this place and those who live here.",

Dan has been knocking them out of the park since he started here a few months back. We finally got carport lights replaced, the front gate gets fixed same day rather than a week later, we gained a handicap access door, and he's taking care of the hallway carpet smell here very soon. Cameras are going up rather than just being talked about. The man is all around improving this place and we appreciate it. Thank you, Dan.",

The manager (Amy) has always listened to our requests and has gotten our maintenance requests done at a convenient time. She takes care of this place like it is her own. Landscaping is done when it needs to, and makes sure people drive slow and safe in the parking lot. Would recommend to anyone. Rent is very reasonable too.",

We lost everything in the floods that hit Sumas in Nov 2021 and I wasnt sure if I would even find a place for my family on such short notice. Thankfully a friend of mine told me about Tullwood so we applied and it couldnt of been more wonderful. We were in our new apartment before Christmas and havent been happier. We know there are elements outside the gate but we are pretty much safe and secure with Amy and the security officers around.\nIts a nice location with extremely nice apartments.

        "review": "update: things seem to have gotten a bit better again. good on the property manager for doing what they can so I added a star.\n\noriginal: I dont know what changed in the past few months but I really liked it here until other residents started to forget that they live in a community. prepare for loud noises at all times of morning, day or night. cars blast their sound systems, dogs bark uncontrollably inside and outside, upstairs neighbors don't seem to consider those beneath them, people park so crooked no one can park next to them, cars have been left in the back of the lot unmoved and covered in moss for who knows how long so good luck getting a spot some days. there's a homeless camp behind Walmart and you can smell their fires at night which doubles as a safety hazard. recently there's been multiple fights in the parking lot. could benefit from having security around.\nI'll change my review if rules are enforced and it's more comfortable again.\non the plus side maintenance is fast, the building is secure, the property manager is nice, and it's away from the main road.",

Now the manager on the other hand was super nice until she decided to fine me for everything she could possibly think of. I ultimately decided to sign a lease early termination and that's when she really screwed me over by claiming I owe over 10 grand in fees. This to me is outrageous when I lived in the apartment for 9 months and took very good care of it!

Spaces are so tight and many residents take up 2 spots. Playground is soo old and falling apart very unsafe. Garbage is always over packed and all over the ground. Kids run screaming through the halls slamming the doors to the stairs and leaving trash in the lobby. Hallways and elevator always have a strong odor.

A last ditch effort I tried talking to Amy our landlord for some sort of extention or anything to help us.

Honestly, I never thought I would have such an amazing time here. Amy was so king to us, literally we got free furniture from her, she hooked us up with Internet because she knows a person at Xfinity (we tried another service but they would not give us internet until a week later) but the xfinity guy hooked it up for us the same night because of Amy!!\n\nAmy really does go above and beyond, and if you have questions, she is super responsive! She even gave us the key to our apartment wayyy after office hours around 10pm! That alone saved us a nights cost for a hotel room!\n\nThe best part is, its a safe neighborhood, literally 5 mins walk to Walmart and maybe 15 mins walk to restaurants and stores like Best Buy etc. Also, the people here are all families or working professionals.

Another management figure, Dan, is also mentioned for his proactive approach in dealing with maintenance issues like carport lights and hallway conditions.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>In terms of exceptional experiences, residents frequently highlight the outstanding dedication of the property manager, Amy. Her actions often go above and beyond typical expectations; for instance, she has been commended for her prompt and effective handling of maintenance issues and her personal interest in ensuring tenants\u2019 comfort and safety.

One common complaint centers around the surrounding environment. Several residents mention the nearby homeless community, expressing concerns about noise and safety that penetrate the residential enclave. This, unfortunately, diminishes the tranquil atmosphere that the apartment complex tries to maintain.</p><p>The condition of common areas, such as hallways and elevators, is another recurring theme in critiques. Complaints regarding cleanliness and maintenance of these spaces suggest that not all aspects of the property meet the high standards set by individual apartments and management. Some residents feel that these areas require more attention to detail, detracting from what otherwise could be a more pleasant living experience.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>On the extreme end of dissatisfaction, a minority of reviews describe significant issues affecting their quality of life at Tullwood Apartments. These include allegations of poor management practices, such as unjust fines for perceived infractions, and mentions of gifting in exchange for positive reviews. Additionally, reports mention problems with security, citing the malfunctioning of gates and the lack of robust measures against non-resident access to the property.</p><p>Some reviews also painfully describe the distress caused by unresolved maintenance issues and the decaying infrastructure of outdoor amenities like playgrounds. The presence of drug activity and other unsavory incidents being observed in the vicinity further compound the grievances of disturbed residents. Several reviews highlight these elements as indicative of what should be urgently addressed to restore confidence in the community's security and living conditions.</p></section>"
