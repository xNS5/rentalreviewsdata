        "review": "Update: Fleas on the 3rd floor as of April - one of the units has a warning on their door. Management did not give any notice to tenants that there were fleas in the building.\n\nWish I could give this place 0 stars. Building was nice when new last year but has quickly gone downhill. The grass outside was a foot deep for the entire summer which was just the start. Had poison hemlock growing around the property, fatal if your dog ingests this. Then one of the elevators broke and was down for months. The front handle of front building door was ripped clean off. When it snowed nothing was maintained around the building - sidewalks were like an ice rink. Power was out for the parking lot lighting for a solid two weeks. The entire building is usually a mess, someone keeps dragging leaves and dirt into the hallways, with cleaning people only showing up once a month if at all. Noisy and bothersome construction of the second phase apartment buildings next door which make working from home impossible without headphones - and the building shakes. Got notification that my lease is actually increasing when there are a ton of units available for 300$ less per month. Consistent with the theme of ignorant management. Will be looking elsewhere, not worth the price whatsoever - half the tenants have already moved out!",

        "review": "Zero Stars.\n\nManagement is non existent, heat is inadequate, door locks on building do not work, loud and dusty construction outside, crime and homelessness surrounding the building all night, street lights in parking lot go out often leaving the parking lot dark, units are poorly constructed with no sound deadening between units, snow removal over winter never happened leaving multiple people from being able to leave, Kylie the leasing agent told us there was air conditioning while there is not, summer time temps on the 5th floor were over 90 degrees (inside) daily, elevators rarely both work, lawn was never cut, and more. The list goes on.\n\nDo not rent here, youll regret it. Most residents are breaking their lease and leaving early, leaving the building in shambles.",

        "review": "Lived here for a little over 2 months so far and no issues! Quiet and good location with trails. Will update if anything changes.\n\n*update 1/27: I have also experienced the same problems other reviewers have mentioned. The elevator are now fixed but it took far too long. The door is now \"lockable\" but remains open unless you force it closed.\n\nThe amenities in the apartment are nice and the location is good...so 2 stars? Customer service is important.\n\nNow the streetlights are out outside making it difficult when you come home in the evenings. The little inconveniences add up. Again, I'll update if anything changes.\n\n*update 6/19: Some concerns have been addressed but only when residents band together. I've noticed more effort recently but that may be due to people signing new leases. No major elevator or door issues for awhile. The theft in the bike storage was addressed. Upping my review to 3 stars for now. Hoping things continue to get better, especially since Crescent 2 is coming along.",

        "review": "management is a ghost. submitted a maintenance request got cancelled and was told to do it myself with no direction or special tools that require to fix outlets and kitchen lights. The front door hasnt been working for days and one of the elevators has stopped working for months. The one that does work sounds like itll snap at any second and theres no ventilation on it so it always stinks like trash or wet dogs. Everything is built very tall and high and is impossible to reach and very inconvenient even as a tall person. None of my emails to Leasing ever get a reply. Also there doesnt appear to be any insulation in the apartment for heating so youre forced to rank up on your utilities bill. On top of overpriced rent. Also if you miss rent for whatever reason they display it by posting the past due on ur door, not even in a discreet envelop like most places with a little empathy. Found this out by walking past a neighbor. look elsewhere",

After reading all the other bad reviews, I don't think it will be worth it to rent from this property. It's a shame because the building is beautiful. It has so much potential to be a great place to live. New management is a must!",

        "review": "Spend your money elsewhere... We moved into this brand new building that had and still has more issues than they know what to do with. If you can even get a hold of someone in their office they'll just play dumb and act sorry. Maintenance issues do not get addressed. Take your money elsewhere. They were and are not willing to work with us when we had unexpected life-issues come up forcing us to move, they just care about getting their overpriced rent. Maintenance and snow removal are non existent, this past snow storm the sidewalks and parking spaces weren't touched. Sidewalks were not walkable, and the front door doesn't open so tenants were supposed to walk around the building on ice-covered sidewalks to get inside. One of the two elevators has been broken 6 of the 8 months we've lived here. Heating systems inside units aren't able to keep up, and they won't heat or fix the heat in the buildings hallways and common areas so our electric heat has to run 24/7. The units do not get warmer than 60 degrees. Leasing agent also lied upon move in claiming the units have A/C. They do not. My fault for not checking, I guess I should have known I was being lied to. Winter temps are no warmer than 60 inside while summer temps are 90+ on the 5th floor. I guess I had decent expectations for almost $2000 a month \n\nUPDATE 01/06/2023\nPTLA HAS NOT reached out like they insisted, instead someone got upset that the front door has been faulty for quite some time now, forcing everyone to walk around. The only handicapped door that is. And now someone ripped the door handle off. Id imagine this will take months for them to fix as well. Once again, do not rent here.\n\nUpdate 01/30/23\nThe streetlights and exterior walkway lights have been out for over a week now. You can hardly see anything in the parking lot or behind the building, must walk with a flashlight. Just a matter of time before all the local Bellingham tweekers that live in the woods next to the building come out and start smashing into car windows to steal stuff now that they dont have to worry about streetlights. Have to assume PTLA just hasnt paid the bill, theyre cheap (obviously).",
