      "review": "I had moved in right when I turned 55 into a 2 bedroom apartment.  Due to personal issues, I moved out, but returned since my first experience was fantastic.  Since coming back, there is a list a mile long NOT to stay here.  Number one; severe building issues such as substantial cracks in the hallways and in apartments which has been caused by \"building settling\".  This is a lie!  The building has been here for 7 years.\nRecently pipes had busted during a freeze.  We are being told not to worry about mold.  This is a worry - people can die from it.  They don't care.  Rents are going up through the roof!  Affinity has decided not to do anything about it.  And yes...they can decide not to take 80% of people social security.\nPool is broken 50% of the time.  Homeless walk around our apartments waiting for the chance to come into the doors. (which they have).\nSave your sanity and move elsewhere.  Do not waste your time!",

          "text": "Barbara, we certainly don't like seeing a current resident so unhappy. That's not what Affinity is about! Some of these items, we have been able to address with you via email and offered to discuss further in person or over the phone at your availability. We provided a letter with details on how we repaired the broken pipe and took measures to dry out and repair the drywall to prevent any additional moisture. To your point, mold is something we need to be proactive in preventing. We have a full moisture management protocol we follow when something like a pipe burst happens to prevent mold from occurring. Our regional managers have made frequent visits to oversee that this process was followed, and the repairs were done correctly. Our exterior doors are key controlled to only allow residents or their guests into our community. If you are aware of a door that is not operating correctly, please report this to the office. Again, we wish you had a better experience at Affinity this time. If there is a way we can work with you on a better experience, we would love that opportunity. Thank you, Lily"

There were a lot of logistics involved and they were very professional and accommodating. The building service people, Norm and Jesus were also provided us with outstanding service. The apartment is in excellent shape, its quiet and the residents have been warm and welcoming,  We are very pleased and happy to be part of this community!",

      "review": "Being here is home to me - the place is always clean, cheerful with happy people not only living here but the ones who are our refuge of help or questions anytime, Laurie, Amber, Kristin.  Always smile and ask us how we are doing.  The group meetings are fun, serious and we ask questions, they are done how and when possible.  I appreciate Laurie's emails. It's very hard for me to get the mail everyday. The neighbors here are very special like none of the other places my husband and I lived independently.  It's a place full of fun, delight and homey with so much to do. It's fun to share when someone asks me how is Affinity. Thank You",

      "review": "We love living here at Affinity in Bellingham! The staff are simply lovely and if we need anything at all they're quick to help.  The community of residents are friendly and there are many ways to be involved and stay connected if you want to. The amenities have something for everyone from the pool, library, theater room (amazing!) wood shop, craft room, game room, billiards,  large outdoor fire pit, large BBQ patio space.. We have dogs and there is a wonderful dog park on site along with beautiful open areas to walk.\n\nThe location is prime with nearby shopping, Starbucks, Costco, and quick access to I-5. The rooms are comfortable with everything you need (including AC, which was a must have). The windows and slider to the deck are very insulated making outside noise unnoticeable. As you can tell, we're huge fans and highly recommend living here!",

The maintenance is top drawer and quick to respond as is the management and staff.  I highly recommend the Affinity at Bellingham for anyone looking for an independent living facility.",

Laurie does her job extremely well to ensure that we feel safe, secure, happy, heard, and genuinely cared for! What other apartment complex does that?? The Affinity staff is second to none also & the Maintenance staff is top notch!! The list of amenities that we have here are amazing so if you are bored, it's because you want to be bored! Lol",

      "review": "These are what I consider upscale apartments for 55+ ages. They offer a lot of amenities in the apartment building, including an elevator. There are usually monthly activities taking place. They maintain the interior and exterior of the building well. Sometimes individual apartment maintenance takes awhile. I find the individual units to be on the small size, but you can get a storage closet, or garage, for an extra monthly fee. Sometimes it is hard to find staff around, but when you do, they are always pleasant.",
