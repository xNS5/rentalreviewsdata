        "review": "Ive lived here 2.5 years now. This place is a great location and there  are tons of amenities nearby in terms of parks and nature. Great apartment to have a dog in.\n\nThat being said, the management switched over a few months ago and things have gone downhill. Rent went up 300 a month, which was over 20% in just one year. Many neighbors on fixed income who have lived here 5-10 years have been forced to move because of it. Very sad.\n\nWe had a meeting with the prop manager about getting the extremely old windows replaced before winter. Currently, they are single pane, meaning they hold condensation after showers and whatnot. That has caused a rather bad mold problem each winter. We were told replacing them over summer was the plan, and a priority. We followed up multiple times, got window measurements ect. It is now November, the rainy season is upon us, and the property manager has ghosted us regarding the issue. Very frustrating, especially considering the ostentatious rent increase.",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing your experience living at Old Mill Village. We appreciate your positive comments about the great location and the abundance of nearby amenities, especially for dog owners. We understand that rent increase can be challenging. We strive to maintain a balance between providing quality service to our residents and ensuring affordability for our residents. We appreciate your feedback on this matter. Regarding the issue with the windows, we sincerely apologize for any misinformation or lack of communication, as well as any frustration this has caused. Peak Management is actively looking at ways to improve the community, addressing items of most importance first. This year, weve addressed several concrete steps in need of replacement (a project still in progress) and allowed the electric company to upgrade their infrastructure. We are aware of the windows, and it is a high priority item on our list. We have collected bids from multiple contractors for this project, and we look forward to providing more information on this soon. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us directly at 360-295-8200 or oldmill@peak-management.com. We appreciate your feedback!"

The content within this article is a summary based on user reviews, aimed to provide a balanced perspective of Old Mill Village. The intent of this article is not to endorse or criticize the property management company, but to summarize the various experiences shared by residents.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Good</h2></heading>    <p>Old Mill Village has earned praise for its idyllic setting and close proximity to nature. Residents have expressed delight in the abundance of wildlife and the scenic surroundings that include geese, deer, squirrels, rabbits, and even herons. The location has been lauded for offering a peaceful, country-like environment while being conveniently accessible to roads leading to the town and freeways.</p>    <p>Further appreciation has been directed at the community feeling and the friendliness of the people living there. Nearby amenities such as a great donut shop, coffee spots, and eateries add to the charm of the neighborhood. The beauty and cleanliness of the place have been regularly mentioned, enhancing the overall positive experience for many of the residents.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Great</h2></heading>    <p>Personalized care from the management team has not gone unnoticed, with some residents highlighting the helpfulness and genuine concern for their experience at Old Mill Village. Specifically, the efforts made to help residents settle in and address their needs has been commended. The location is also noted for its artifacts like picturesque lake views, and attention to maintaining an attractive and clean environment.</p>    <p>Among the amenities, the dog-friendly nature of the property stands out, being an attractive aspect for pet owners. Additionally, large parks along with lakeside views and beach access elevates the living experience for those who appreciate outdoor activities and serene landscapes. Residents have acknowledged that Old Mill Village offers a blend of natural beauty and good value for an affordable lease.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Bad</h2></heading>    <p>Despite the positive feedback, some residents encountered issues with the property management, particularly concerning addressing maintenance concerns. A significant complaint involved the neglect in replacing old, condensation-prone windows, which have led to recurring mold problems. Despite promises and discussions about tackling this problem, as of the time of this reporting, the issue remains unresolved, leading to frustration from the impacted residents.</p>    <p>In one reported instance, there was a considerable rent hike that surpassed 20%, drastically impacting tenants, particularly those on fixed incomes. This abrupt increase has supposedly forced long-term residents to consider moving out, creating a sense of insecurity and dissatisfaction within the community. Such financial strains have been a source of distress and have overshadowed some of Old Mill Village\u2019s desirable qualities.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Ugly</h2></heading>    <p>While not widespread, there have been complaints about poor noise insulation leading to disturbances during quiet hours. An upstairs neighbor\u2019s activities were mentioned as a cause for discontent, indicating a concern for potential noise issues within the living spaces. Although the company has responded to these complaints and appears willing to address them, it is a concern that could affect the living quality for some tenants.</p>    <p>Additionally, the lack of timely communication from the property management, as portrayed in a user review, indicates a need for improvement in responsiveness. Being \"ghosted\" on serious maintenance issues, such as the aforementioned window replacements, is not only inconvenient but also points to a lack of effective management practices. The way such situations are handled can contribute negatively to resident satisfaction and trust in the management\u2019s ability to resolve concerns.</p>  </section></article>"
