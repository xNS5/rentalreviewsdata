        "review": "We rented a 3-bedroom 2nd floor apartment for 5 months while house-hunting. It was great to find a unit that we could rent by the month; also it was cat-friendly. We were the first occupants of the unit, after construction of the building. Having all solid surface flooring was nice, but there appeared to be no noise insulation at all behind the walls or between the floors. We could hear the showers running and toilets flushing from the 3rd floor apartment above us with amazing clarity. The neighbors above us had a dog and we could hear his claws scratching the floor when they played with him (we assume) inside. (We didn't hear all his \"pawsteps\" though.) The owners/residents had heavy footfalls and we *could* hear them walking. We tried our best to walk softly so we wouldn't bother the people below us but we don't know if we were successful. We didn't have any issues with maintenance, and the property management company (Landmark) was fine, with professional and helpful staff. No surprises with fees, etc. CenturyLink is pre-wired into the units for Internet/cable; as of the time we stayed there, no other provider was available in this building. We have no regrets about staying here but wouldn't want to be long-term residents.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Sophia Place Apartments offer a pet-friendly environment, which is an attractive feature for many potential tenants. Several user reviews mention the allowance of both dogs and cats, providing flexibility for pet owners. Some tenants appreciate the solid surface flooring in the units, which can be easier to clean and maintain compared to carpeted options. Additionally, the property management company, Landmark, has been described as professional and helpful, which indicates a generally positive experience with management. Overall, short-term renting options are available, allowing residents to lease by the month, which is beneficial for those in transitional phases such as house hunting.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>One particularly positive aspect of Sophia Place Apartments is their willingness to rent by the month. This flexibility is ideal for situations where tenants are temporarily residing while seeking longer-term housing solutions. Moreover, the introduction of new construction offers the benefit of being the first occupants, eliminating concerns of previous tenant wear and tear. Residents have noted surprise-free fee structures, which enhance financial planning without unexpected costs. The pet-friendly policy, allowing both dogs and cats, caters to diverse tenant needs, contributing to an inclusive and comfortable living environment. Overall, the arrangement is suitable for short stints, ensuring a satisfactory habitation without long-term commitments.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Noise insulation appears to be a prominent issue at Sophia Place Apartments, as many reviewers highlight the lack of soundproofing between units. Residents have reported being able to hear everyday activities of their neighbors, such as running water, clipping footsteps, and dog's movements. Furthermore, waste management seems to be a recurring concern, with overflowing garbage bins noted frequently by some tenants. This indicates a potential lapse in property maintenance oversight, leaving residents dissatisfied with the overall cleanliness of the premises. There are also limited service provider options available, specifically mentioning that CenturyLink is the only pre-wired Internet/cable service, restricting tenant options for connectivity. Following up on these concerns could significantly improve tenant satisfaction.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>One severe downside reported by tenants is the absence of a management presence on-site. This lack of immediate support exacerbates issues when problems arise, leaving tenants feeling neglected. Despite having no issues reported with maintenance requests, the need for management to be promptly available is crucial for tenant comfort. The absence of responses from management or owners to user reviews further suggests a disconnect or lack of concern about tenant feedback. Addressing these concerns could drastically improve the reputation and living experience at Sophia Place Apartments. Additionally, the noise disturbances between units not only disrupt daily life but reflect poorly on construction quality, as the lack of soundproofing affects tenant privacy and peace.</p></section>"
