But after being in the unit for 10-15 minutes, my partner and I came out covered in fleas. If you are considering this property, PLEASE CHECK FOR FLEAS. It might have just been this unit, but it might be a problem in the entire complex. Other than that the management was nice, but I really question their integrity and transparency by allowing us to tour a flea infested apartment. I have pictures of the fleas as well.",
