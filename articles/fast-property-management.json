        "review": "I'm 60 yrs old, and I have rented the same apartment in Woodland Townhomes since Aug 2012 (almost 11 yrs.) Speaking only from my own personal experiences.. Kris & Kim Fast have always been polite to me.. if your honest with them, if you respect them, they will respect you. I personally have never had a problem with management.. they've always given a 24-hr notice if they need to enter my apartment for any legit reason.\nThe maintenance man, Piers.. has always been nice & respectful towards me.. he's a thoughtful and understanding person.  Anna Fast who helps with management is polite and professional, it's always pleasant communicating with her.. she's a good person. Integrity & respect for others is everything, I recommend the Fast Property Management Team.",

The 1 issue I've had in the multiple years renting with them they had someone out that day to check out the issue and get it fixed.\nDoubly impressive being when that I split with my partner they helped him find a similarly priced place in their management portfolio.\nNever been more impressed with a management company than with these guys. 100% would recommend",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Fast Property Management has received numerous positive comments from tenants, reflecting a consistently high level of satisfaction across different aspects of their service. Tenants frequently praise the company for their prompt maintenance response and handling of issues, as highlighted in one instance where a tenant noted that a maintenance request was addressed on the same day. The management team, particularly Anna, is often described as polite, professional, and respectful, fostering a pleasant living environment.</p><p>Many users appreciate the respectful and considerate communication style of the team, notably Anna Fast, who handles tenant interactions with warmth and professionalism. This level of service and the integrity with which tenants are treated contribute to the company's positive reputation. Such positive interactions and prompt service make tenants feel valued and well-cared for, creating a sense of trust and loyalty among the residents.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The exemplary service delivered by Fast Property Management extends beyond the basics of maintenance and communication. A notable feature that sets them apart is their consideration for tenants' unique circumstances, demonstrated when they assisted a tenant in finding a comparable unit after a separation. The management team is described as going above and beyond standard expectations, ensuring that the properties are well-maintained and that tenants feel comfortable and secure in their homes.</p><p>Tenants appreciate the peaceful living conditions offered by properties managed by Fast Property Management, with comments noting the quiet atmosphere and friendly, yet private, neighbors. Beyond the physical aspects, the responsive and caring nature of the staff enhances tenants' overall living experience, as evidenced by testimonials describing their living arrangements as delightful and the management team as the kindest and most considerate encountered in their rental experiences.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>In this particular set of user reviews, there is a notable absence of negative feedback or lower ratings, which is unusual for a property management company and may indicate consistently high standards of service. Due to this lack of negative reviews, potential issues or dissatisfaction elements that are common in the property management industry, such as unresolved maintenance problems or poor communication, are not presented here.</p><p>While this paints a very positive picture, it is also important for prospective tenants to consider other potential unmentioned factors that might be obscured by the overwhelmingly positive feedback. In evaluating a company solely on positive reviews, one might miss out on lesser-known aspects or isolated incidents that could provide a more comprehensive assessment. Therefore, while the reviews are excellently favorable, approaching with a critical eye could provide a balanced view.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>There are no reviews detailing any 'ugly' experiences, such as severe neglect from Fast Property Management. The complete lack of negative feedback could suggest exceptional service, but it is also important not to overlook that adverse situations might still occur, as is possible with any property management service. Instances of 'ugly' in other contexts could include deposit disputes or significant security concerns, but such issues appear to be entirely absent for this company according to available testimonies.</p><p>In the absence of damning evidence, it would be easy to conclude that tenants do not experience significant problems with Fast Property Management. However, prospective tenants should also be aware of the possibility of exceptional circumstances not captured by existing reviews. The challenge remains to maintain such high standards without room for complacency, ensuring all aspects of management continue to meet, if not exceed, tenant expectations.</p></section>"
