Doesnt help at all. Recommend not going to the managers for any help or not rent here at all. We should be the ones getting good service not being threatened like if we dont pay rent and pay them basically.",

Ive had my vehicles broken into/ stolen at least 4 times. Homeless people taking over the dumpsters and office staff that only cares about their own image. The communication between residents is also completely controlled and censored by office staff. Be careful renting here",

They found cockroaches after moving in and the management just shrugged it off and said they should have spotted it before moving in. Him and his roommate are being charged thousands of dollars for trumped up damage claims for pre existing wear and damage. Will be working with the Washington State Attorney Generals Office to pursue action against them for violating tenants rights.",

I loved that each unit had a washer and dryer.\n\nI miss living here and we only moved because we moved out of state. If youre looking for a nice place to live I highly recommend it. Most places do not compare. Wonderful location and awesome amenities.\n\nI believe the pricing on these units is fair and is actually accurate due to the booming market in Bellingham. Count your blessings it could be 2.5 more in other states.\n\nAnd yes, I really did live here.",

      "review": "The only nice thing about this complex is their pool. The pool and hot tub are great. Other than that, expect to get a terribly laid out apartment with appliances that constantly need repairs that are NOT worth the price by any means. The staff is generally kind, but they are very disorganized and put us through a lot of stress because of it.\n\nWe added a roommate after moving in who, despite handing in all of the paperwork weeks before he moved in, was not added to the lease until three months later when they applied his rent check to a different apartment and almost evicted us because of it. They gave us notices for showings of other apartments, so those people never received proper notice just because the lady failed to read the apartment # correctly. They also wrote our lease incorrectly the second time we signed it to add our roommate, which ended up costing us about $1300 when we moved out. They also skimp on the deposit refund.\nSo I would stay away. You can easily find somewhere cheaper, much better quality and better managed.",

      "review": "This place is not worth the money they are charging for rent. There is no storage space, super small kitchen (which the burners dont work half the time), and parking is terrible. We had a 6 mo lease and had found out 2 weeks before our lease was up that we had got our new home. They said they have to charge us another months rent for somewhere we are not even going to be living. Thats a lot of money to give for something that isnt even in use.\nAnother issue i had is I initially thought my package got stolen or delivered to the wrong apartment. Come to find out it had been delivered to the office. They are never open before I have work and I get off later than their office hours, and they are hardly ever open Saturdays. I was reminded of my package after they sent it away.\nYou fight for parking spaces close to where you live or you pay $60 for a reserved parking spot. Its not laid out very well.\nThere are some sketchy characters that hang around there, Not necessarily residents, but homeless or people who come from the trail,  My sister had stayed the night with me and her tires were tampered with that very night.\nThe only plus to this place is it had a pool for the summer and close to Barkley and that is about it.\nPoint being there are nicer places that are better managed for cheaper.",

      "review": "Recently a tenant died unexpectedly from cancer. He and his wife were on a 6 month lease.  But due to his death she needs to move,  thereby breaking the lease.\n\nBarkley Trails Apartments have told her she needs to pay $3000 for breaking the lease as well as another month's rent. This is a recent widow! She has funeral expenses and medical expenses from her husband to worry about.\n\nHer husband didn't die from cancer just to inconvenience the apartment owners. This was an unexpected death as his cancer was in remission but came back unexpectedly and with a vengeance.\n\nI would think that Barkley Trails Apartments would show a little compassion and give his widow a break rather than ripping her off like this. Tragedies happen.  Have a heart for Christ's sake.\n\nThis is taking advantage of someone who has just lost her husband,  and needs to move because she can't afford to stay with the lease. Not someone who is skipping out on the rent, or has done property damage to the apartment.\n\nREPLY FROM BARKLEY TRAILS APARTMENTS OWNERS:\n\nResponse from the owner\nan hour ago\nHi Lynn, we hear your frustration and empathize with anyone going through something so terrible. We are sad for the loss of loved ones, and what they are going through. We want to be respectful of our Resident's and former Residents privacy. Thank you, Barkley Trails Team\n\nHOW IS THEIR DEMANDING $3,000 FROM A TENANT WHO HAS JUST BEEN MADE A WIDOW SHOWING RESPECT FOR HER LOSS? THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS! THEY CARE NOTHING ABOUT TENANTS .

This means someone will be smoking outside your bedroom window at all hours of the night, or you'll hear dogs barking at all hours of the night, or both. Try enjoying a nice summer breeze with your balcony door open, just to have the aroma of cigarettes come wafting in because your neighbor needs to puff puff puff. Gross. Also, the noise level is high. The washer/dryer and dishwasher are very noisy and you can clearly hear people walking/talking/etc. in the other units adjacent to yours. The grounds are not kept up very well at all times, and there are a lot of college students here. The office staff is nice but generally ineffective. For the money they charge in rent and deposits, it's not that nice of a place. Do yourself a favor and keep looking.",

They asked us to send them a selfie holding our ID's after this was all completed. I was told this was to verify our identity, but they had already ran a credit check. When I questioned this practice, the manager stated \"we already have your information, and your social security number\" and questioned why they were receiving push back. If the reasoning was truly to verify identity, they would have waited to run a credit check on someone they are claiming was not verified. We were approved pending us sending them a selfie holding our ID's. Ultimately I cancelled the application, and will be avoiding this companies properties.",
