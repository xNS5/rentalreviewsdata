        "review": "The only reason I was able to navigate - and survive - the process of buying a house in Bellingham and selling a house in Seattle (in that order) was having Anne Cantrell at my side. Her experience, coaching and advice helped me find the perfect house, on the market only three days, with 11 offers, all over asking price; the seller commented that I had the best agent. She also helped me, in a softening Seattle market, to price and show my house such that I received an offer within one week. Superlatives are insufficient to describe my gratitude and appreciation for Anne's expertise.",

  "summary": {
    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Among the positive aspects of Coldwell Banker Bain of Bellingham, users have highlighted the high level of professionalism and education of their brokers. Users frequently cite the brokers' integrity and their keen attention to the needs and concerns of their clients, suggesting a personalized and considerate approach to property management. Additionally, the shared experiences paint a picture of agents who are seriously committed to their clients, ensuring that they have the necessary support and wisdom to navigate the real estate market.</p><p>Coldwell Banker Bain of Bellingham has also garnered acclaim for its responsive and reliable service, particularly during first-time sales processes. Specific examples from user reviews detail how agents, like Trish, have provided prompt and clear communication, efficiently answering all questions and simplifying what could otherwise be a complex transaction. Such testimonials of a stress-free and smooth experience with Coldwell Banker Bain indicate the company\u2019s capacity to exceed the expectations of their clientele.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>The excellence of Coldwell Banker Bain is further illustrated by user reviews detailing exceptional experiences, particularly during simultaneously navigating the buying and selling of properties. One user expressed tremendous gratitude for an agent's expertise, which significantly contributed to securing a highly sought-after property amongst numerous competing offers and achieving a swift successful sale in a less favorable market. The support offered by the agent throughout this process was praised as instrumental, underscoring the company's great ability to deliver results in challenging circumstances.</p><p>Moreover, Coldwell Banker Bain\u2019s agents are described as having a profound depth of knowledge, supported by advanced industry tools and education. From the Canadian border down to Portland, their expansive knowledge base and the comprehensive support of the CB Bain/Seal team is commended. This suggests that the firm's resources and education systems play a pivotal role in empowering their agents to provide outstanding service that is highly regarded by clients.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the numerous positive user reviews, a singular account casts a shadow over Coldwell Banker Bain\u2019s reputation. A review by a client who reported dissatisfaction raises concerns about the potential drawbacks of working with the firm. The client's difficulty in dealing with the property management company, combined with allegations of excessive fees and misrepresentation of properties, reflects issues that prospective clients might find worrisome.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most distressing concerns arise from the suggestion within a user review that Coldwell Banker Bain might be part of a local operation engaging in less-than-favorable practices, particularly towards those from outside the Bellingham area. Such an accusation of conspiracy with other local entities to impose undue charges creates a stark contrast to the accolades seen in other reviews. This type of allegation, if true, could severely tarnish the company's image and suggests a potential area for improvement or clarification by the firm to offer peace of mind to future clients.</p></section>"
