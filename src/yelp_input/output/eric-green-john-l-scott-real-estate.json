Eric is experienced and privy to all things Whatcom County real estate - and personable to an extent where you feel like you've been friends for years. Highly recommend chatting with Eric about any of your buyer/seller needs!",

I never felt pressured to \"settle\" and knew that Eric was always acting with my best interests in mind. I would highly recommend Eric to anyone in need of a real estate agent and know that whenever I decide to buy another home or sell this one, I'll work with Eric.",
