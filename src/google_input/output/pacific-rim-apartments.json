        "review": "A friend lived here on a ground floor. In the middle of the night the tub filled with sewage and the toilet overflowed into the bedroom. They never sent anyone to clean the bathroom after the issue was fixed. The outside drain on the patio overflowed from never being cleaned out and the entire apartment flooded and the neighbors. They had neglected cleaning the main drain. They then had the audacity to raise the rent $100 a month for this dump. It's ghetto.",

        "review": "The current property manager goes out of her way to make sure your day stinks. She's a sticker natzi with those giant neon green warning stickers, that are insanely difficult to remove from your drivers side window. I was helping my daughter move some furniture with a U-Haul, the small sized truck, and I had parked it for a few hours while deciding what to haul away next. She plastered that sticker on the window of the U-Haul truck, stating that I cannot park the vehicle in the parking lot. WHAT??  The following day, she went after another person for the same reason, except while he was getting into his truck to leave, she still attempted to put that sticker on his window.  She also claimed that he was  blocking the side walk, which he was not.  Yesterday, a vehicle pulled in and parked. I'm not kidding when I tell you that 15 minutes later, that car had a sticker for expired tabs. It was a visitor, not a resident, and she had just purchased the tabs but needed to wait for the rain to stop to put them on. People, these aren't ordinary stickers. They adhere to a surface stronger than anything I've ever seen. They're water proof too. She gave my daughter a warning to move her car that she doesnt drive to a different spot or the car will be towed. She moved her car, but it was still towed away, and this manager said it was due to expired tabs. That's not what the warning was about. I also heard this lady threaten to kick a little 4lb dog, because he was not on leash and was sniffing around at her feet.\n\nOther than that, the units are cute, but it's impossible to get maintenance to your place if you don't have a major emergency like a busted pipe or the building caught fire. Anything else, forget about it. Super frustrated with the management and staff. Please don't let this place be your first pick for a new place to live. It's more of a place to go if your only other option is homelessness.",
