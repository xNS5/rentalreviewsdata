        "review": "THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! DO NOT MOVE HERE I BEG YOU!\nThis place is an absolute nightmare, and was before we moved in, and continues to be.\nI couldn't scratch the surface of how bad this place was, but to give you context it was about $800 a month per person, and we lived there for about a year.\n\n-AWFUL communication from the multiple people who owned the property (I think there were 3 companies that owned in in less than a year). The emergency line (on multiple occasions) went unanswered, they just really don't care.\n\n-The apartments themselves SUCK. Not only are they small, but the design makes no sense. We had no living room/living space, and had no openable windows in the main area.\n\n-There is no upkeep to the property. This place is the definition of \"don't fix it, paint over it\". In the winter, there was a broken waterpipe that made accessing the parking lot dangerous -they didn't fix it for weeks.\n\n-No one who works there has any clue what they're doing (expect for Carl and Niko, who are awesome). Probably due to the management constantly changing, no one is ever able to give you a straight answer on anything -that is if you can even reach them. You call, you email, you can visit the office. Most of the time, they will not answer your calls (even if you leave a message), and are almost never at the office during office hours.\n\n-My roommates and I were tricked and lied to when it came to our lease. When we signed the lease, we were signing a lease for 5 bedrooms. AFTER we signed the lease, they told us no 5 bedroom apartments were available, so we ended up having to split up. We were totally tricked/trapped.\n\n-The security deposit was $200. After emailing and calling SEVERAL people, I finally got my deposit back about a month after moving out. When I got it, they had taken out $85 for maintenance and cleaning. WHAT?? Not only was the apartment FILTHY when we arrived, we also deep cleaned it before leaving. There was absolutely no damage, so there is no reason that money should've been taken out.\n\n-For weeks in the Winter, and Spring the fire alarms would go off for minutes at a time. Everyone would have to pack up themselves and their pets to move out into the parking -only for the fire department to tell us that there was no fire, but faulty equipment. THIS HAPPENED PROBABLY 10 TIMES ALTOGETHER.\n\n-Consistently bad wifi, no place to set up cable or internet in the main area\n\n-No circulation (food goes bad pretty fast)\n\n-Laundry cost $4 a load. The machines are disgusting and never get cleaned, same with the dryers that usually don't dry your stuff properly. It's ridiculous we have to pay at all.\n\n-Of course, rent is expensive everywhere, but to have the audacity to charge so much money for such an HORRENDOUS place to live is criminal.\n\nPlease don't move here, I promise you'll regret it.",

        "review": "Absolutely horrible! My apartment was flooded from a hot water heater leak in the apartment above and they continued to charge me rent for the unlivable apartment while I arranged moving and found a new place while unable to walk because of an ankle surgery I had a few weeks earlier. So argumentative and money hungry. The maintenance crew is great, but management is horrible! Also raises rent by about 17% for the next year so I just count my ability to break the lease as a God send in the end!",

        "review": "Living here a month now. It's VERY close to campus, just like I hoped. Directly across from a bus station and dorms! It can get a bit loud (cars and neighbors) and you don't really get much of a chance to know who your living with other than gender before fully commiting to a room. I got very lucky and have fantastic roommates though. You do get your own room with a lock and key. mine comes with a space with pretty good size for price in this area (a twin bed was a good call though) the laundry room requires a key they give you and you do have to pay for the machines. But the rent is a straight fee which is fantastic!! Easy to budget. Over all this place feel pretty safe and it's a great place to start off. Also staff is very friendly ",

        "review": "Management is either shady or completely incompetent, probably both.\n\nDon't expect any update during your application process, and enjoy the uncertainty of housing that accompanies that silence. After hearing nothing 3 months after their approval process was supposed to begin and you've sought housing elsewhere you'll get a call saying you've been approved, hopefully the other places haven't already approved/don't have nonrefundable deposits.\n\nThey have waitlists multiple times longer than the amount of available units just so they can keep the waitlist fees when you have to find housing elsewhere. Only upside is the waitlist fee was on the lower side at $100, but that still means the company pockets $1,000+ just by being slow and keeping names in a queue.",

        "review": "Ive lived in Viking Gardens for about a year, and up until now I have had a fairly good experience renting here.\nMy main problem with WWU Living involved an issue with my renters insurance. If you have renters insurance from a provider other than e-premium be prepared to prove that you not only have proof of renters insurance but that you also have proof of a $100,000 general liability in your renters insurance policy. And be sure to show that proof of a $100,000 general liability in your policy right away when management asks for it- or else management will charge you a $30  non-compliance fee. Beware. I rarely give reviews online- especially with my name attached to them- but I wanted to let others know in the hopes of helping them avoid a situation like mine with their renters insurance.\nOther than that the apartment itself is fine and the location is very nice, which is the reason why this review is 2 stars rather than 1.",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Hi Bridget, we are happy to hear that you enjoy the apartment, the location and have had a positive experience with us. We regret to hear that you are frustrated by having to provide proof of renters insurance but appreciate the chance to turn your experience around. We would be happy to reverse the non-compliance fee, if you can show that you have had an active policy. You will find that this is a fairly common practice at apartment communities because unfortunately, not all residents are so responsible to keep active policies, so it has forced us to these standards. Our community manager is available to speak with you more regarding this matter, and to reverse any fees that should not have been assessed. We look forward to hearing from you."

        "review": "YOU WILL LOSE $100!!\n\nThis has to be the worst apartment complex ever, its one thing to scam adults, another to scam young kids first starting college. When applying to this place they make sure that you put down a $100 \"holding deposit\" but dont get confused because if you dont cancel within 24 hours you lose it! so after weeks of calling and hearing nothing back I attempted to call and get my deposit back only to be hung up on and told it was policy. DO NOT GO HERE! Find a house, get someone real not these scumbags.",

He then had a water leak from upstairs neighbors 9 months ago and after several requests to fix the gaping hole in the ceiling they never fixed it.  My son lived there for 2 years, as it is cheap and has great access to the school.  The maintenence team is kind, but the leasing office is 100% unresponsive.  Steer clear of this place.  correction this  review is for skyvue operated by same company",

        "review": "WWU living is absolutely the worst company I have ever been forced to deal with.\n\nGiven their reputation I never in my life would have considered living with them of my own will, but they took over the apartments I was living in that were controlled by Landmark when I moved in.\n\nAs soon as they took over, they raised the rent from 1050 to 1500, and in the letter that they put in everyone's doors to announce this they also told us they knew this would result in most of us moving out and that was okay with them. They had absolutely no problem taking over and kicking roughly 300 people out of their homes.\n\nAfter they took over the quality of our interactions did not improve any, they did tons of remodeling with the current residents living there and often did not give apt notice for the projects that they were performing. One time I remember opening my front door and all the flooring had been removed from the hall and some glue was setting on the ground. Never received any notice or heads up but I could not leave my apartment for like 3 hours.\n\nAnother time they dropped unsolicited lease addendums that they just wanted everyone to sign and give back to them, like forcing a lease addendum on a current resident is not totally and completely illegal. They ended up sending them another 2 times when no one signed them, but there are multimillion-dollar lawsuits that have been won for forcing a lease addendum on a current lease.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this company to anyone. Every time I've gone to their office, I've been told that there is nothing they can do, and really nothing they are willing to do.",

Had a nightmare suitemate that took months to handle and the OLD property manager (I think his name was John) stole my security deposit and the company went after me for 2 years to get a 2nd deposit, even after proof I had paid it *and* they forgot to change my forwarding address when they did it, and tried to blame me when I had proof I gave them a NTV in writing.\n\nI've both worked here and lived here.

        "review": "The room and location are fine. However, it seems there are more people living here than there are parking spaces. Every time I leave then come back I'm looping round and round the area praying someone leaves so I can park. I've been late to class several times because of this. Due of the lack of space I've been forced to park on campus, I've spent over $150 parking on campus due to not finding parking at the complex I pay $725 a month for. Very, very, very, very frustrating. I've had to walk a quarter mile with groceries because of this parking issue. Assigning folks their own parking space needs to be a priority. I rather make the commute from my folks home which is over an hour away than renew my lease.\n\nI never give out reviews but I'm frustrated with this place because of this. I don't want people committing here who work evenings and come home to no parking spots then having to settle with parking a lot farther than they need to. We're students and have assignments to turn in before certain deadlines, we need to make it to our classes on time, etc. Having parking assigned to folks should be again, a priority.",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Hi Alexander,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to reach out and let us know of your concerns. We understand that the parking can be difficult to find at times and that alone is frustrating. We have had many discussions on how to improve the parking at all our sites and the only issue we continue to run into is there are not enough spaces to assign everyone a spot. It would require us to assign spots on a first come first serve basis. We have not ruled this idea out but are still discussing what would be the best option. We do offer our residents the ability to park at any of our other sites if its an uncovered space should you not find any parking at University Heights. Our neighboring community Taylor Heights, does offer reserved spots and garages that you can pay for to ensure you have a spot to park in.  Again, we apologize finding parking has been such a frustrating experience and we hope to improve the situation as soon as possible. We would be happy to meet with you and discuss any further suggestions you may have."
