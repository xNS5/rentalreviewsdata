Some of the apartments lack natural lighting and ventilation on the first floor but the 3rd floor is very enjoyable and let's lot of natural light in. Responsive management.",

Be aware.\nManagement and owners seem to be somewhat concerned about keeping the place comfortable, but turned out to be untrustworthy on multiple occasions. Would steer clear if possible.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Stoneway Apartments is situated in a prime location, as highlighted by user reviews that appreciate the convenience of nearby amenities. The building offers a pleasant environment for those residing on higher floors, as some users mention that these units enjoy abundant natural light, enhancing the living experience. In terms of management's responsiveness, at least one user review acknowledges that the staff is prompt in addressing concerns, which can make a difference in the overall tenant experience.</p><p>Moreover, the apartment building is described as relatively safe, which contributes to the sense of community and security for its residents. Though specific examples are limited, the positive aspects of Stoneway Apartments seem to stem from general location benefits and a feeling of safety, making it an attractive option for those who value these elements in a living space.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The proximity to a UPS store stands out as particularly beneficial for residents, as noted in user reviews. This feature compensates for some mail delivery issues and allows residents to conveniently manage their package needs without significant disruption. The presence of responsive management, as mentioned in one review, further enhances the livability of the apartments by potentially ensuring that issues are dealt with promptly and effectively.</p><p>Another highlight is the enjoyment derived from the third-floor apartments, described as having ample natural lighting. This detail contributes to a more comfortable and pleasant living environment for tenants residing in these units, as natural light can significantly affect mood and ambiance. </p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite its optimal location, Stoneway Apartments suffer from a significant mail delivery issue, as no package companies deliver to the building. According to user reviews, this inconvenience affects all residents, creating potential frustration for tenants trying to receive mail and packages. Although there's a UPS store nearby, this setup adds an extra step for residents needing to manage their deliveries.</p><p>Another point of concern is the lack of natural lighting and ventilation on the first floor, which could affect the comfort level of living spaces. According to a user review, these units do not benefit from the same light-filled atmosphere as the third-floor apartments, which might make them feel less inviting. Such disparities between units can lead to uneven satisfaction among tenants.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>A major red flag mentioned in the user reviews is the distrust that has developed towards management and owners over time. Specific incidents leading to this sentiment are not detailed, but the review's tone suggests a repeated pattern of untrustworthiness. Such experiences can sour tenant relations and create a negative living environment, which is particularly concerning for potential renters evaluating their options.</p><p>The absence of a reply from the property management to the user reviews adds another layer of negativity, as it indicates a lack of commitment to addressing public feedback. This silence from management can deter prospective tenants from moving in, as they may perceive this non-responsiveness as indicative of broader communication issues.</p></section>"
