        "review": "Tracie did an amazing job for us and helping us buy our dream farm in Ferndale, WA. We decided to move,  in a very tight timeline with some complexity and Tracie was fantastic from start to finish (and beyond). She had great suggestions for us and local knowledge to help us get settled in quickly. She just really took care of us as we managed to get our house in Seattle sold quickly and prepared to move the 2 hours away. Everything really went smoothly because of her communication and hard work.",

        "review": "How did my wife and I get so lucky to pick Tracie as our agent! Based on feedback we received, we decided to enlist Tracie in helping us find a house in the crazy, Bellingham market. From our first meeting to the day we finally procured the keys to our new house, Tracie was absolutely amazing.  There are quite a few traits that stuck out to us about her:\n\n1. She is tireless worker. She answered our texts, e-mails, and phone calls whenever we had them. She may have other clients, but you won't know it. We always felt like we were here one, and only clients.\n2. Her knowledge if the home buying process is second to none. It was reassuring knowing that she would never let us get into a bad situation when it came to writing offers and/or reviewing counter offers.\n3. Tracie understood our budget and did not let us wander from it. She was very conscious of only showing homes that not only meet our needs, but arrived within our budget.\n\nAnd the best part about working with Tracie? Her upbeat and can do attitude! We were under a serious time constraint to find a place to live. Even as our deadline loomed over us, she was still optimistic that we would not only find a house, but we wouldn't settle. That went a long ways in helping the confidence of my wife and I.\n\nThis sounds so cliche, but not only did we find our realtor for any of our future needs, but I'd like to think we found a friend as well.\n\nThanks Tracie!",

        "review": "Tracie is a the complete Realtor. She kept working and found us a house in a wonderful neighborhood that we could afford. This is after I about gave up. She constantly kept searching, showing, calling until we got our dream home. Even got us a loan officer that we simply love.\n\nSince it was a \"good bones\" sorta house, Tracie also found us a contractor, tree trimmer, plumber, painter, gas inspector....this lady is the complete package. \n\nI highly recommend Tracie to anyone seeking a home, condo or apartment.\n\nMichael Azevedo",

She clearly cares about serving her clients wants and needs above all.\n\nTracie quickly showed me her wide and deep understanding of the current housing market. She focused on understanding who I was as a buyer in terms of my values, lifestyle, and budget. Then she carefully led me through the process to help me make the best possible decision.",

We are first time home buyers with minimal real estate knowledge and Tracie was fun to work with, passionate, and dedicated to finding us the home that was a good fit. Tracie was always available to answer questions and we would recommend her to anyone looking for a great real estate agent in this competitive market!",

        "review": "We have had the pleasure of working with Tracie on two different real estate transactions. When helping us buy our house she highly encouraged us to hold onto our current property as a rental - something we never dreamed was possible. She even went so far as to provide us with great advice and resources to find and maintain excellent tenants. Later when we decided to sell our property she was able to do so quickly and effortlessly. She truly went above and beyond and checked in with us through every step of the process. We would not hesitate to refer her to our closest friends and family and will continue to use her services in the future.",

        "review": "Tracie is the absolute best. She came as a recommendation through a friend and made the first, at times frightening steps into learning about home ownership so much less stressful. She is warm, professional, and a vast source of knowledge. I felt completely comfortable bringing her any and all questions and could always count on her to reply in a timely manner. She kept channels of communication open perfectly, but I never once felt pressured to take a step I wasn't comfortable with. I am so grateful she was my first contact in this ever-changing and complex market and would 100% recommend her to anyone.",

Tracie helped us understand the value of owning a home and explored what this could mean for our lives. We now own a beautiful home (our first!) in a neighborhood we love! She helped us with every step of the way from viewing a bunch of possibilities, to making an offer and buying our home (all while 9 mo pregnant btw!) I felt really good about working with Tracie because she was committed to our dreams coming true! She is dedicated to every part of the process and made us feel confident and comfortable with this new step! I highly recommend her to everyone! Even if you're just curious, talk to Tracie!",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>This article highlights the overwhelmingly positive feedback that Tracie Gulit from Windermere Real Estate has received from her clients. Many users have praised her for being exceptionally dedicated, noting her tireless work ethic and excellent communication skills. For instance, one user described her as always available to answer texts and calls, making them feel prioritized, which is a recurring theme in several reviews. Her ability to understand her clients' needs and budget, while guiding them through the home-buying process, has led to many successful transactions.</p><p>Clients have also appreciated her local market knowledge, which has proved invaluable in making informed decisions. For example, one reviewer mentioned how Tracie\u2019s suggestions and insights helped them quickly settle into their new home. Other users reported that she provided practical resources, including recommendations for contractors and financial advice, making her a well-rounded agent who supports her clients beyond just the sale of a home. Such comprehensive service and client-first mentality resonate strongly in the positive reviews.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>This article also showcases how Tracie's friendly demeanor and professionalism create a fantastic experience for her clients, often described as joyful and reassuring. Multiple users highlighted her upbeat attitude, which is especially appreciated when navigating the sometimes stressful home-buying process. Her ability to maintain a warm and accommodating approach has made many first-time home buyers feel confident and supported, as indicated by a user who remarked that Tracie made learning about homeownership less intimidating.</p><pFurthermore, the consistent praise of her reliability is notable. Users have reported feeling comfortable and secure because she kept communication channels open without overwhelming them. This balance led to many positive experiences, making clients feel like they were in good hands, ultimately persuading them to recommend her services to family and friends. Tracie\u2019s approach has evidently converted many first-time interactions into robust relationships based on trust and mutual respect.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p: Despite the largely positive sentiment surrounding Tracie Gulit\u2019s services, the absence of any negative reviews highlights a potential concern for diversity in client experiences. There were no user reviews explicitly outlining any challenges or constructive feedback, which could lead to questions about transparency in her practices. It is unusual for a business to have a perfect record without any reservations expressed by clients, as it may suggest a lack of critical engagement from users.</p><p>Furthermore, while the overwhelmingly positive feedback indicates a successful model, it may raise red flags for prospective clients seeking a balanced view of what working with Tracie entails. With no documented instances of problem-solving or handling difficult situations, users might question her manageability during challenges or how she addresses service gaps. Without this context, potential clients may be left wondering how she operates when facing less-than-ideal situations.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The lack of negative reviews also means there are no glaring issues or \"ugly\" experiences reported by users, making it challenging to dive into the less favorable aspects of Tracie Gulit's performance. However, this absence might also indicate a lack of critical examination and oversight in client relations, leading to potential pitfalls in service consistency or adaptability. Clients looking for real estate agents often seek fully rounded experiences, encompassing both challenges and successes.</p><p>Moreover, without facing any issues or criticisms, some may question the authenticity of the reviews, as numerous glowing comments lack critical assessments that are typical in real estate feedback. Such a scenario could suggest a missed opportunity for growth and improvement for the company. In an industry where understanding varying experiences can significantly enhance service quality, clients may long for a more comprehensive view that includes how agents handle adversity or client dissatisfaction.</p></section>"
