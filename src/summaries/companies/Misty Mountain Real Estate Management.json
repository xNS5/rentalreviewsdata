      "review": "Stay far far away from any property managed by this company.  My daughter and her roommate lived in the apt less than a year and left the place in wonderful condition.   Then they were billed for all sorts of \"damages\" and cleaning fees.   The guy then was very condescending when talking to them and finally agreed to no additional charges but they still lost their security deposit even though there was no \"damage\" to the unit.",

      "review": "If I can help it, I will never rent from or use MMRA Real Estate Management company (or any of its affiliates - Misty Mountain Reality, Weichert Reality) ever again.  I have never had a worst experience with a landlord ever.\n\nThis is why-  \n* The unit was filthy when I moved in, yet they charged hundreds of dollars to clean an already clean unit when I moved out.  \n* The rent was significantly increased every year.\n* Their management was condescending and rude.  Our experience was so bad that it made my wife cry.\n* Upon move out they deducted a significant fee from my security deposit to remove their own equipment. These were items that they had left in my unit after repairs were completed months before.  Adding insult to injury they also charged me a hefty fee for generating an invoice for removing their own equipment from my unit.\n* Because I refuse to sign a non-defamation waiver, they will not return my remaining security deposit.  MMRA acknowledges that this is money I am owed; they just are refusing to return my money unless I keep quiet about them.\n* I had to buy my own mailbox keys from the post office, yet MMRA tried to charge me for the key deposit.\n* MMRA charged a nonrefundable move/ in move out fee of several hundred dollars. This is on top of a big security deposit.\n* In my opinion, lease requirements prevent you from ever really making it a home - you can't have more than three small potted plants, and no pictures can be hung on the wall using anything more than a thumb tack. Our family pictures and paintings sat in a closet for three years.\n* Required routine outdoor maintenance were not performed without complaints to management. (I at my own expense kept the property fully maintained and weed free, the neighboring tenant had to demand that MMRA remove the large weeds and overgrowth present when they moved in).\n\nIf someone does decide to rent or buy from these people, I recommend that they read any documents very closely, be prepared to fight for anything you need or are owed, and based on my experience, don't expect to get much of your security deposit back.",

      "review": "I wish I could give misty real estate -3 stars because they are the absolute worst management company out there, if you want to be taken advantage of, have no money because it all goes towards them, and be constantly confused as to what you're even paying for with no explanations, you definitely should rent from them. Never have met such rude and unhelpful people in my life.",

      "review": "To be completely honest, this company strictly only cares about getting your money. They usually make it off of college kids, I assume it's easier to not get as much backfire from a bunch of kids who don't know what they're doing really. We received an invoice for an extra 4 or 5 hundred dollars for \"extra water usage\" one month. We didn't believe it so we paid for someone to come out and of course they had a leak that they hadn't bothered to even check before asking us for more money and getting mad when we asked questions. That's just the beginning. Do not trust this company",

For this reason, plus their lack of customer service skills and rude unprofessional office personnel phone exchanges, I will look elsewhere  for property management options.",

      "review": "I was a tenant with mmra for about a year and a half. The move in was easy, we took over a lease from the previous tenant, filled out a transfer form and that was it, I was told to pay the previous tenant X amount for the deposit, which I did.\nWe called a few times over our stay to have things fixed, like heating and a fireplace that would not turn off. All calls where ignored, we were told several times someone would be out, never happened. \nWhen we finally decided to move out we got the packet for cleaning and followed it to the letter. We documented everything, pictures of every room, door ect. When I got my deposit back, it was short about $250 for \"cleaning,\" a pest control fee, and a couple other random fees.\nI contacted the office to try and get some answers, 3 calls later And being told I would be contacted by someone, I called back and spoke with the assistant property manager. She said nothing noteworthy was found during the cleaning and that it's a standard cleaning. I sent her the pictures of everything, and she agreed with me that it looked very clean and she would speak with the property manager about it. I received an email that said \"the charges stand\". I called back and was told ide be contacted, nobody returns my calls.\nSo essentially they stole money to pay for cleaning that I was told by them didn't need to be done, they provided NOTHING stating what was wrong and REFUSED to allow me to walk with them during the move out inspection. Sounds fishy right? Well I was also charged for a \"pest cleaning,\" I for one would have sued to get out of a lease if there where pests in the property. They said it was because the PREVIOUS tenants had pets, something they never bothered to tell me, what would have happened if I had a pet allergy? They wouldn't have cared, they only want your money, I'm posting this because I don't want others to get ripped off like me.",

      "review": "This management group looked and sounded like the real deal: business suits, all the right answers to your questions, setting the tenants at ease. Their price tag gave me sticker shock, but you get what you pay for, right? Wrong! A careful look at their contract gave me cause for concern. Although they were very reassuring with their responses to those concerns, I pointed out that the contract itself was not so reassuring. I was told that in three days I would receive a return call to see if my two biggest concerns could be addressed via wording changes or addendums to the contract. Twelve days went by with no response. My call on day twelve was not returned. What happened to professionalism? How about a simple email: \"I'm sorry, but we were not able to make the contract changes you were hoping for. Please let us know if you are still interested in signing with us.\" I am stunned by MMRA's utter lack of respect for potential clients. My contract concerns turned out to be a blessing. Because of them, I learned that professionalism, as with beauty, is often only skin deep.",

      "review": "So awful. We were told first come first serve with applications. Two weeks later we get a call they are showing the house to a bunch of people and that they hadn't even looked at our application. They basically had all of us at the house showing fight over who could get a hold down the quickest and it was so unprofessional. The current tenants were being kicked out early because they didnt want to prelease another year when they were told it would be month to month when they moved in. They screw everyone over and charge you up the ass for ever mark you leave on a property. Even the actual home owners of this home hate having to be legally bound to them. \n\nGo to son-rise or landmark if you want a good experience and home.",

Upon calling back I was put on hold by Tyrell 3x's & told that the manager was first out of town then unable to take calls & I was again refused a name or phone number.\n\nI was sent invoices for charges which included poorly installed toilets & closet flashing which led to further damages!!!\n\nDo not give any of these people your hard earned money!! If you kids a student at Western, talk them out of renting through this agency!! They will bill you for anything they can get away with!!!\n\nIf I could give a negative star I would!!!!",

  "summary": "# Misty Mountain Real Estate Management: A Balanced Look\n\nIn this article, we delve into the experiences shared in user reviews of Misty Mountain Real Estate Management, a property management company based in Bellingham, WA. This article's intent is to provide a well-rounded understanding of the company's services, with information derived from reviews structured to reflect the good, the great, the bad, and the ugly aspects of the company. Keep in mind that these reviews are generated by ChatGPT, and they serve merely as a tool to assist those searching for a property management company or rental property.\n\n### Good\nMisty Mountain Real Estate Management, at its core, is a business dressed in the attire of professionalism. Users have mentioned the initial impressions being positive, with staff presenting themselves well and responding adequately to initial inquiries. Some users have reported that staff seemed knowledgeable and gave the impression of a company that could be trusted with managing real estate needs.\n\nUpon engagement, the company often provided prompt service. For example, one user reported that the move-in process was handled quickly and seemed to be streamlined, suggesting the company can efficiently manage lease transfers and document handling. It appears that on the surface, Misty Mountain Real Estate Management can present a fa\u00e7ade of efficiency and professionalism that initially sets potential clients at ease.\n\n### Great\nHowever, there are no user reviews that suggest that there are great aspects to point out. All user reviews have given the company the lowest possible rating and have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the services provided. Therefore, this section cannot be completed as per user reviewers' experiences; there are no indications of the company exceeding expectations or providing outstanding service in the management of its properties.\n\n### Bad\nThe negative aspects, on the other hand, are abundant. Users have voiced frustration over unexpected charges and the mishandling of security deposits. One review cited being billed for damages and cleaning fees that seemed unjustified, while another spoke of significant yearly rent increases and rude management. This theme of financial dissatisfaction appears consistently, with users feeling overcharged and underserved.\n\nCommunication, a critical component of effective property management, has also been cited as a weak point for Misty Mountain Real Estate Management. Users remarked that emails went unreturned, and staff were described as unhelpful and condescending. Such experiences contribute to the perception that the company neglects the basic needs and concerns of their clients, leading to a breakdown in trust and professional rapport.\n\n### Ugly\nDelving deeper into the uglier aspects of user reviews, several accounts describe experiences that border on exploitative. There are claims of the company taking advantage of inexperienced renters, such as college students, with one user detailing how they were treated unethically concerning water usage charges due to an undetected leak that the company had apparently ignored. In another alarming account, a tenant described how their deposit was withheld without clear justification, even after providing evidence of the property's clean condition upon move-out.\n\nIssues with property conditions were also mentioned, including concerns about mold and inadequate maintenance, further damaging the company's reputation. The aggressive business tactics reported by users, such as showing properties to multiple potential renters at once to create competition, are particularly disturbing and fall far below expected ethical standards. The fact that Misty Mountain Real Estate Management has not responded to any of the eleven user reviews worsens their image, suggesting an absence of concern for their public reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\nAs heightened by the reviews examined, it is vital for potential clients to conduct thorough research and tread cautiously when considering Misty Mountain Real Estate Management for their property management needs. Remember, the user reviews presented in this article are synthesized for informative purposes, and while they reflect a concerning pattern, it\u2019s important to approach any company with due diligence and personal judgment."
