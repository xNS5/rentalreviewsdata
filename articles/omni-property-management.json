        "review": "OMNI Property Management manages properties for landlords with an unparalleled level of greed and incompetence, including:\n  regular unnecessary maintenance (they own some of the companies that do work on their properties, so are adept at creating make-work to pad their grift)\n  egregious failures to do critical maintenance on major systems or employ reputable, competent repairmen for appliances\n\nOver almost a 2-year period, OMNI charged or cost me:\n  $242 to repair a dishwasher that had to be replaced a few months later\n  $538 to repair a refrigerator that had to be replaced a few months later\n  $123 to replace batteries in a thermostat after the TENANT put the wrong kind into it\n  $137 to restart a tankless water heater after they failed to monitor/fill the propane tank\n  $179 to rake leaves on a house/property with minimal leaf fall and no need to rake them up (and if tenants are required to maintain lawns on houses, why wouldnt minimal leaf-raking be the same?)\n  over $1,000 to repair a furnace due to their failure to replace its filter even once (see attached PHOTO, with new, clean filter for comparison)  with an average recommended filter replacement schedule of every 3-4 months, it should have been replaced at least 5-6 times\n\nAll this in addition to the almost $3,000 in management fees they didnt earn.\n\nUPDATE TO REVIEW (12/20/2024):  If youre a landlord thinking of using OMNI, pay close attention to their SILENCE in their response about their failure to change the furnace filter over almost a 2-year period, causing over $1,000 in damages.  This mirrors their silence when I first sent them the attached photo.  They have yet to take responsibility for this egregious abdication of duty by failing to perform very basic preventive maintenance.\n\nAnd the repairmen who came to repair the still-broken appliances are the ones who called OMNIs repairmen incompetent, right before they told me the appliances werent repairable.\n\nSo if youre considering using OMNI, be prepared to pay for their incompetence, lies, and refusals to take responsibility for property mismanagement and damages.",

          "text": "Jennifer, \nIt is unfortunate that you feel we misrepresented our role as manager but as we were unable to communicate with you directly  for the majority of the time we managed for you. Along all paths of maintenance we were getting authorization from your representative. When instructed we send an appliance repair person to try and save the owner money. Unfortunately there comes a point in the life of an appliance that repairs are no longer viable and a replacement is needed. We are happy to source new appliances for owners when that is what they wish to do. Owning a rental is not a cost free endeavor and is therefore not for everyone. I believe that keeping your house safe and occupied while you were unable to live in it was accomplished with a great tenant to boot. \nWe do our best to take care of the needs of the Owners and the Tenants to the best of our ability in a timely fashion. There are items that the tenants are responsible to care for but a home located in the woods has it's own costs and challenges. We also have a standard that we require the homes we rent to be so that we are offering a new tenant a clean environment to move into therefore an exterior clean up is sometimes necessary. \nAs it has been almost a year since we closed out your account I hope that you have been enjoying your home. \n\nLacey, Omni Property Management.

        "review": "We rented with Omni for 1.5 years, in this time they increased our rent twice by a total of ~$200, took ages to fulfill maintenance requests (or fully avoided to until we moved out). Now, since we were forced to move out because of the exorbitant prices, they have since failed to rent any of the remaining vacant units in the building, which they have now lowered to prices similar to what we were paying when we FIRST moved in. If they hadn't gotten greedy, they could still be taking my rent right now, but instead they care about increasing rent as much as physically possible. Avoid at all costs, they will take you for every penny!",

        "review": "If I could leave less than 1 star, I would. My daughter was recently contacted by Chey at Omni that a tri level apartment (which she was on the waitlist for) was coming up available for rent at one of their properties. My daughter filled out all necessary lease paperwork, as did I as a cosigner. My daughter sent over her deposit as well. Literally right after we submitted everything to them, my daughter gets an email from Chey that the listing had a TYPO, and the apartment was not a tri level which is what was advertised. Chey was very kind and apologetic, and said she would pass on to her office manager on Monday the situation and that this wouldn't work for my daughter, as the first level of the promised Tri-level apartment was needed to accommodate her ESA animal. Well, come Monday morning, Lacey the office manager called my daughter and right away lit into her, telling her that we are on the hook for a 12 month lease of an apartment that we didn't want. My daughter was calmly trying to explain the situation to her, but she didn't want to hear it. This mistake was clearly on their end, the right thing to do in this situation is apologize, cancel the contract and return my daughter's money. Lacey has no intention of doing that. My daughter has not moved into this property, the previous tenants are still living in the apartment for 2 more months. Lacey has since emailed us both a form to sign....an End Of Lease, Notice to Vacate. This form is for people who are currently living at the property and are planning to move out! When asked if she would return my daughter's money, she said it just depends and said she had written all she was willing to and would not confirm that her money would be refunded if the lease was taken on by another tenant. On What?? She said she needs to find another renter for the apartment before she will let us out of the lease and will possibly return some of her money. This woman is preying on my daughter who is a hardworking responsible adult, who needs a suitable place to accommodate her ESA animal. Money is very tight for everyone right now, and she certainly can't afford to give away $1600. BEWARE dealing with Lacey and Omni Property Management. Very unprofessional, in communication, they do not see you as a human being, just people to take money from.",

Ive rented through many different companies over my last 8 years in Bellingham and have ALWAYS had issues with move out fees, even when I spend days and days cleaning. OMNI is the first company who has been honest and transparent about move out fees! Yes, I was obviously charged a cleaning fee (thats expected for any landlord especially places with carpet) and I didnt replace a few lightbulbs. Both fees I understand and were not exorbitant, which is highly unusual for other companies. In 8 years, Ive rented from almost every company in town and OMNI is truly the only one I would recommend. Staff is extremely kind and responsive and empathizes when tenants are having maintenance issues.

I read the few low ratings sitting at the top of their most recent (as any property management is bound to have) but felt happy to move forward and see a lease through.\n\nIm happy I have chosen Omni and so grateful for their amazing staff. I have found Jessica to be so extremely helpful and friendly. Shes truly a gem and it makes me happy to be renting from this company. They are on top of their response time to questions and concerns and have always gotten back to me promptly.\n\nI recently had been having my difficulties with my autopay and was given grace to be refunded for late fees so kudos to their understanding!\n\nAs someone in service industry it can be daunting to rent from a property management and prove income, but Omni (specifically Jessica) worked with me to find ways to provide proof of income which took a heap of stress off the process.",

I waited three months and was never contacted. Finally I contacted OMNI days before rent was due to figure out how to pay them. I was told it was their busiest week of the year.\n\nWe were told rent would increase and six months before it happened they quoted us about a 20% increase. Then, two months before they doubled it to a 43% increase.\n\nWhen I asked if this was a mistake, I was told that 'the house could be rented for more if it were marketed today.'\n\nNice",

After much work on the home and changes in city requirements you were give 2 additional months at the same very low rate. We then again negotiated the offer for a discount for another 3 months. Even currently your rent is several hundred dollars lower than market rent. \nWhat many renters do not understand is that the cost of ownership has increased greatly over the past several years in Tax increases, Insruance increases and the cost of labor and materials to make repairs.  Taxes alone have increase around 30% over the past 3 years. And though this is not the case for you, many owners also lost month's of unrecoverable rent during Covid. Some even lost their property because they were unable to pay their mortgages. \nWe understand that rent increases can be challenging, and we want to assure you that we have made an effort to keep this adjustment reasonable. We value our tenants, and we are committed to providing them with a well-maintained and comfortable living environment.\nPlease feel free to contact us directly to continue this conversation in a private arena. \nSincerely,\nLacey Lutjemeier, \nOwner, Operation Manager\nOMNI Property Management"

I loved the property I rented but if I hadn't been moving out of state I would have moved to a property managed by anyone else, without hesitation, and paid more to avoid the loopholes of an Omni leasing experience. I've rented from private landlords and other management companies in other areas and never felt as taken advantage of as I did by Omni. If you are considering renting with them I would highly advise you to consult the Washington State tenancy laws before you sign anything that will minimize your rights.",

We make every effort to explain the lease agreement and requirements in a clear way as we understand that the legal wording required can be confusing. I see we went back and forth multiple times by email/text during this transaction. Roommate switches and lease changes can add to the confusion with so many parties involved.  Our hope is that if you feel there is something more we could have done you would reach out to us directly to try and rectify the situation. However, I understand that there is not always a completely satisfactory solution for all parties involved.  All leases have costs involved for certain items and we make best efforts to remind tenants what is written in their signed lease agreement as soon as these situations come up. \nWe hope that you have found a more satisfying living arrangement for yourself.\nBest Wishes, \nLacey Lutjemeier, Operations Manager\nOMNI Property Management LLC"

Upon moving in we noticed the thermostats did not work, which means if you turned it on to a temperature the apartment would just continue to heat and would never shut off. We put in a work order to have them fixed, not only did they not fix it but the maintenance man told my girlfriend to Google how heat works. Lacy then took it upon herself to come to the unit and turn them on to prove a point. Basically we had on off switches for thermostats, on top of that they charged us $55 for the maintenance response.\nFast forward to month three of the lease, we paid rent on their website (the same site and card number that we had used the two months prior), Lacy calls us half way through the month to tell us that there was a $150 late fee for rent not being paid. Lacy could not give me a reason why it did not go through. She basically told me I had to pay $150 for a glitch in their system. After arguing with her for 20 minutes she finally told me to bring in a paper check that day only to wave the fee. We moved and are now seeing the charges for deposit.\nWe were charged 17 hours of labor for the unit Cleanup which is ridiculous, the pictures she sent us of our \"excessively dirty\" were straight up laughable. It was just some sweeping that needed to be done. So that means we don't get a deposit back. Ridiculous.\nI am extremely happy to be done with this property management company.

        "review": "I own property at a condominium in Birch Bay and a house in Lynden.  Although you aren't supposed to discriminate when it comes to housing, I also feel that you don't have to tolerate the bullsh!t from bad tenants wrecking a place.  I talked with Lacey L from Omni Property Management and explained that I wanted a win-win situation.  She was able to narrow down tenants who had responsible and courteous lifestyles (OMG, that actually exists!) and we have not had any problems.  Of course, I also did my part by checking out the units and making sure things were clean, working, and passed inspection.  I would also get my hands dirty and scrub, vacuum, and clean. Still...I might be able to change a lightbulb, but I'm no handyman.  Also, I've heard horror stories about tenants behaving badly, not paying rent, and then claiming they are the poor, helpless victims against the Evil Landlord (Lordy...grow up and save that drama for your next Oscar).  So, I don't have time for that.  I mean, really...how hard is it to pay one's rent on time, keep the noise down, and not demolish a place?  My friends and I were able to do these basics growing up.  Then again, I was an Eagle Scout, so perhaps my values are slightly different.\nAnyway,  thank you, Lacey and Omni Property Management, for making sure that I don't have to put up with that baggage.  I've got more important and fun things to do.  Lacey has always been available when I've phoned or emailed, and has returned my phone calls if she could not pick up right away.  It's been 5 years so far and no complaints from me or my tenants.",

The water rushed into the kitchen and I was able to let the man know that it was spreading. Didn't do much, in fact it made things worse.

My daughter filled out all necessary lease paperwork, as did I as a cosigner. My daughter sent over her deposit as well. Literally right after we submitted everything to them, my daughter gets an email from Chey that the listing had a TYPO, and the apartment was not a tri level which is what was advertised. Chey was very kind and apologetic, and said she would pass on to her office manager on Monday the situation and that this wouldn't work for my daughter. Well, come Monday morning, Lacey the office manager called my daughter and right away lit into her, telling her that we are on the hook for a 12 month lease of an apartment that we didn't want. My daughter was calmly trying to explain the situation to her, but she didn't want to hear it. This mistake was clearly on their end, the right thing to do in this situation is apologize, cancel the contract and return my daughter's money. Lacey has no intention of doing that. My daughter has not moved into this property, the previous tenants are still living in the apartment for 2 more months. Lacey has since emailed us both a form to sign....an End Of Lease, Notice to Vacate. This form is for people who are currently living at the property and are planning to move out! When asked if she would return my daughter's money, she said it just depends. On What?? She said she needs to find another renter for the apartment before she will let us out of the lease and will possibly return some of her money. This woman is preying on my daughter who is a hardworking responsible adult. Money is very tight for everyone right now, and she certainly can't afford to give away $1600. BEWARE dealing with Lacey and Omni Property Management. L",

Submitted an app and was told i was declined because they couldnt verify my business whis has been registered in Washington for 13yrs. Income verified over $8k/mo good references, zero late payments ever-  i habe never been denied and was confused, however after such a poor response, i have found it to be a blessing- professionals should be able and expected to locate a business at very least.",

        "review": "Omni helped me out a lot when I first moved to Bellingham in July 2020. They provided me with a solid, affordable rental with minimal hassle, which is far from the experiences I had with other property management agencies who jerked me around and one of which even stole money from me. Omni, on the other hand, conducted themselves with integrity and were very easy to work with for the duration of my lease. When something needed to be fixed, they got it fixed. If there was some sort of miscommunication, they did not hesitate to clear it up. They were always very kind with me, and when I moved out, I received my entire security deposit back; apparently this is rare among Bellingham rental agencies, but I wouldn't know because I've only ever rented from Omni and they were awesome. If you are an honest, respectful person, they will provide those same qualities in return. Don't hesitate to reach out to them if you need a place to rent!",

        "review": "OMNI declined rental application based on arbitrary requirements. Don't expect to be treated with respect or for the company to follow rental requirements when deciding to rent out a unit. According to the owners we were not the \"right\" tenant for the place and the owners just didn't like us. I wish I would have gotten to talk to the manager Lacey, because apparently she is the person to talk to but I was given the run around by Katy.",

It is unfortunate that you had such an unpleasant interaction with our company and if there is anything specific we can do to make any future interactions more pleasant I hope that you will reach out to us directly. I assure you that we follow all state and federal guidelines when reviewing applications and unfortunately in this competitive market we are unable to place everyone in the unit they desire. Thank you!"

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>OMNI Property Management has received numerous positive reviews highlighting their commitment to tenants and property owners alike. Many users appreciate the company's promptness in addressing maintenance concerns and their professional demeanor. For example, one tenant praised OMNI for resolving plumbing issues quickly and for being courteous throughout their stay, making for a satisfying rental experience. Additionally, property owners have expressed contentment with OMNI's management, noting that the company promptly communicates updates and successfully manages tenants and property upkeep without delay.</p><p>Another favorable aspect highlighted by users is the clear and fair handling of lease agreements and move-out procedures. A tenant, who transferred from another state, commended OMNI for their helpfulness in navigating new rental laws and praised the transparency in their dealings. Similarly, other clients mentioned the ease of online rent payment systems and the absence of unpleasant surprises when leasing with OMNI. These reviews collectively contribute to a positive perception of OMNI's operational effectiveness and tenant satisfaction.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Several reviews suggest that OMNI Property Management goes above and beyond typical expectations for a property management company. Long-term clients reported seamless interactions and emphasized the staff's friendliness and willingness to accommodate tenant needs promptly. One user mentioned that OMNI resolved maintenance requests swiftly and even went the extra mile by offering grace on late fees due to an autopay issue, reflecting the company's understanding and flexibility.</p><p>OMNI's ability to maintain a well-structured and empathetic service comes through strongly in these reviews. Clients have applauded the team, especially specific staff members like Jessica, for their exceptional support and genuine concern for tenant welfare. The high volume of reused business from landlords also indicates satisfaction with OMNI's effective tenant management and their ability to foster long-term relationships through quality service and communication.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite many positive reviews, there are some dissatisfied tenants who have raised concerns regarding OMNI Property Management's operations. A recurring issue found in reviews is the delay in communication and unresponsiveness at times, particularly in stressful situations like lease errors or urgent maintenance needs. For instance, a renter expressed significant frustration when an advertised apartment feature was incorrect, and claimed that OMNI's handling of the situation fell short of expectations, impacting the trust they had in the management.</p><p>Another user review pointed to unreliable maintenance services, where repeated failures in major systems were supposedly overlooked or mishandled, leading to unnecessary costs and prolonged inconvenience. Such instances, albeit not the majority, indicate areas where OMNI might need improvement. Although OMNI appears to respond to these reviews, acknowledging the issues with offers to resolve disputes privately, these negative reviews still reflect certain instances where tenant expectations were not met.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>In some cases, dissatisfaction with OMNI Property Management has escalated to severe frustrations and grievances as voiced by certain users. One review described a harrowing two-year experience where maintenance mishaps led to significant inconvenience and financial strain, with claims of overcharges for repairs that were consequently ineffective. The interactions with OMNI's repairmen and the company's lack of accountability were stressed as major failings by the tenant, leading to a completely negative perspective of the company.</p><p>Other highly critical reviews describe unethical business practices, such as accusations of unfair application rejections and deposits mishandled without reasonable explanation. Particularly telling are instances where tenants and applicants felt misled during application processes or when dealing with complicated lease terms. These reviews indicate a severe breakdown in communication and trust, overshadowing the positive experiences of other users and painting a troubling picture of mismanagement in isolated circumstances.</p></section>"
