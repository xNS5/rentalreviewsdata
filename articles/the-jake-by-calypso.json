Good mix of single people, couples, families, etc. Summer inner courtyard will be nice. Parking garage is a must. Trash room is NASTY, this place should have dumpsters, who thought of the room of a hundred bins was smoking crack.",

A recurring point of concern in user reviews is the property's trash management system. The presence of a room with numerous bins has been critiqued for being unhygienic and inconvenient, suggesting a need for better waste disposal solutions such as the use of traditional dumpsters. Another minor inconvenience is the limited number of elevators, which occasionally causes discomfort for residents, especially during peak times when elevator availability becomes a necessity for convenience.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>As of now, there seem to be no overwhelmingly negative reports or severe criticisms targeting the fundamental aspects of living at The Jake by Calypso in the user reviews. Issues raised are relatively minor and do not suggest any major systemic problems with property management. There have been no recorded responses from the management on user reviews, leaving a gap in communication that could be filled to address minor grievances. This lack of direct engagement might be seen as a missed opportunity to proactively manage resident concerns and improve tenant relations further.</p></section>"
