        "review": "What you can expect from this complex:\n- Being able to park wherever you like, even across spots!\n- Having dings/scrapes on your car from people hitting it\n- Blasting music from 9am-2am\n- Being snowed in\n- Trash in the hallways/corridors\n- Dog poop all over the property that isn't picked up\n- Dogs running around and not on leashes\n- Getting your packages: most are delivered to the office which isn't always open, so add about 2-4 days to your expected time\n- A pretty good maintenance team that responds quickly\n- Convenient location\n\nWhat you can't expect:\n- The office to do ANYTHING about issues except send out a single email (if they remember)\n- Regulated rent - each apartment is priced differently, even if it's the exact same unit. They up the rent whenever a unit is available and have no clear amounts (as verified on their own site)\n- Not to step in dog poo (even if you don't have a dog)\n- Peace in your apartment because it's noisy as all get-out\n\nSo yeah, location and maintenance are awesome, everything else sucks!",

        "review": "I've lived here for five years, seen multiple rotations of staff through the front office, and can comfortably say that I have had really lovely experiences. \nMaintenance has slowed down due to a severe shortage of staffing, but urgent issues are addressed promptly. Courtney, the complex manager, is friendly, diligent, and communicates well. Rent has increased quite a bit since I moved in but it's comparable to other Bellingham complexes, and Maple Park is quiet, feels very safe, and is pet-friendly. (There are a few cats that are safely able to be indoor/outdoor cats, which is saying a lot.) \nMany residents have been here for multiple years, and I've seen residents leave and then return a year or two later. \nPlus, it's managed by Suhrco, NOT landmark, which in Bellingham is just a massive plus. \nI've kept an eye out for other apartments in the city, out of curiosity, and haven't found anywhere that feels even remotely worth the move. \n\nMy only moderate complaint is that sometimes Amazon or USPS get lazy when the leasing office is closed and decide to just not deliver packages, but I guess Courtney said something because it's been several months since they pulled that nonsense.",

        "review": "I moved into Maple Park Apartments nearly two years ago during what was a very difficult time in my life. My two bedroom ground floor unit was clean, spacious, and had more storage than any apartment I have ever lived in. In fact, the plethora of storage space was one of the things that made moving out a very difficult decision.\n\nBut in addition to all of the cupboards, the outdoor storage, and the world's most gigantic coat closet, Maple Park Apartments offered something that can't be seen in photos. It was the smiles, and friendliness of their manager and staff that contributed to this being such a great place to live. The complex is kept impeccably clean, and maintenance requests are handled very quickly. There is always someone around sweeping, painting, repairing, or planting new landscaping. The office staff, Sara (the manager) and Tanya are like friends when you go to the office with a need, question, or just to pick up a package. Often, residents are seeing chatting away with these two fine ladies. I don't know how they get any work done, they are very popular around there! Bob, who heads the maintenance department, is also just about the friendliest guy around.\n\nIn addition to the storage, and the smiles, Maple Park is like a retreat. There are well landscaped paths, a great clubhouse which you can use for entertaining, an indoor hot tub, and a lovely outdoor pool that's open in the summer. There's also a cabana with two large BBQ grills for residents to use, and a playground if you have little ones. While we did not have any pets, many of our neighbors did, so Maple Park does appear to allow cats and small dogs. The complex also host events throughout the year, like potlucks and movie nights.\n\nIt's been almost 20 years since I had to rent an apartment, and I could not have had a better experience than I did at Maple Park. I will truly miss these guys as I move on to my new place. Thank you, Sara and Tanya and Bob and staff, for giving us a safe haven to call home.",

        "review": "I made a yelp account specifically to give this place a 1-star review. that's how fed up I am. The front desk is nearly impossible to get a hold of and when they finally answer they're so unnecessarily rude and unhelpful. The idiots who \"work\" here made my housing search so much more difficult and complicated than it ever needed it to be and I'm honestly appalled by how bad the service was. Even the other houses/apartments I looked at that bad service did not compare to how absolutely horrible this place is. Not somewhere I want to live.",

        "review": "Don't rent here unless you don't mind favoritism from the manager. I was able to see an attractive woman, who was not a resident of the community, sitting on a bench for one or one and a half hours. A young girl ran out to walk her dog, saw the woman, halted and quickly returned home. This on a few occasions. There is no excuse for that. Who would ever want to call this place home? When I moved in I found a big earthworm on my living room floor which was so unusual that I had them change my locks. Practically every employee interrogated me as to why. Such abuse of privacy is extremely serious. Courtney Long, the manager has systematically mismanaged everything concerning me. She has to be the laziest human being that I know. The office is always closed. I disliked it as a place to live so much that I broke my lease two months early.  With just Courtney Long, a young female tenant and myself, their conversation turned to \"Feminine hygiene.\" It made me wonder whether she had some kind of agenda or difficulty with men. I repeated it at a later time and she showed no recognition. Upon leaving for vacation in the middle of the month I left a check for rent. They cashed it immediately which just shows how little respect they have. The next vacation I decided to send in my rent from there. They claimed that they never received it and two thick envelopes were stuck on my door and in my mailbox. I had to pay $ 110 in legal fees also. I wrote a new check for the rent. Suddenly the check that was sent in was discovered. I said that it could be put towards the next month's rent. It was cashed immediately! Once can be claimed as a mistake; twice, it's deliberate. 3 times threatened with eviction with a thick letter stuck to my door and another going to my mailbox. She exaggerates her importance. Maintenance threw up dirt with their power tools onto my patio, also causing a strong odor. For responding strongly to this I was threatened with eviction and accused of cussing which was false. All the passageways to the front doors are filthy and no effort is made to clean them. It is two weeks after my departure and Long's reply to refunding my security deposit was that she still has thirty days to do so. Lazy.",

        "review": "I moved in here in August 2015. The rent is comparable to similar sized apartments in the area. There are no built in light fixtures in the living room or bedroom, which I prefer - built in fixtures tend to be plain at best and really ugly at worst; I'll use my own lamps, thank you very much. While larger rooms would be nice, the rooms as fine as they are. Same with the closet. The kitchen is one of the best apartment kitchens I have seen, better than the others I looked at before choosing to move here. The landscaping needed a lot of work when I moved in, work they have been doing diligently; the grounds are looking really good. A major plus is that Maple Park is extremely dog friendly and I feel quite safe walking her at any hour.\n\nOne reserved parking spot per apartment is not unusual; many of the apartment complexes I looked at in Bellingham, and rejected, have no reserved parking at all.\n\nThe office staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Peggy left just weeks after I moved in here, so I have very little experience with her. I found her to be business-like and no nonsense; not warm and cuddly to be certain, but not overly unfriendly. Tanya is wonderful, as is Sara, the new manager. The maintenance staff is friendly, helpful and good at their jobs.\n\nUPDATED Sept 2017. I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars. If you're a good tenant, don't create problems and pay your rent on time or early every month, they show their appreciation with an 11% rent increase. I can't move in the short time before my lease expires, so they can bleed me for another year, after which, I'm gone. Excellent management but the owners don't know how to keep good tenants.",

        "review": "I have lived here for nearly a year now and it's safe to say the best apartment complex I've ever lived in. The new management really turned this place into feeling like a home. Very friendly staff that are always accommodating. \n\nFor information on the units; I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bath with the master bedroom having a sink and vanity. The units utilize every inch of what they have to offer. There's storage on the deck, a massive closet inside (think narina), and a coat closet down the hall. If you get the opportunity to live here, pull the trigger! You won't regret it.",

        "review": "For starters, the previous comment is spot on regarding the apartments. No lights in the rooms, small closets, small rooms for the cost.\nPeggy, the \"manager\" is an unreachable, combative, violent human being.\nWhen our son was told he had to not only lose his deposit but owed an additional $695 on top of the security deposit for new carpet my husband was baffled. He had helped move the guys out!! He vacuumed the carpet!!! \nWhen he tried to speak to Peggy, she grabbed paper work out of his hands!! My husband has never been confrontational!! When he ask about what happened, she mentioned photos, but could not show them. She told him to leave & acted threatened & when he ask for her manager she gave him a disconnected number.\nWe are smart enough to find the right people & will handle this as the professional, non-violent people we are.\n\nDo not ever rent from Peggy!!!",

        "review": "This place is a complete joke. DO NOT RENT. They only give you one parking spot, which is fine if you only have one car per apartment, but in many cases this is not how it works. The landlords are completely nasty and condescending. Tonya is afraid of the world, while Peggy is the nastiest person I've ever met. I tried to move out at the end of the month because our lease is up, but because I didn't submit the paperwork TWO days before now, I am unable and have to pay rent for an extra month despite me not living here. They are incredibly inflexible, and obnoxious. The apartments are not worth the cost. They don't come with lights in the bedrooms, or the living room. They are small, and grungy. If you choose to sign a lease for another year, your rent increases, Do NOT rent from these people.",

        "review": "DO NOT RENT, the manager Peggy lied numerous times and promised call backs regarding the security deposit and \"other costs\" that were crazy.  My daughter rented an apartment at Maple Park Apartments for the school year of 2014-2015.  When she moved out she and her 2 roommates were charged an additional $900 for not cleaning the toilets or the showers, and supposed burned mark on the counter-top which they indicated would have to replace the whole counter-top for $400.  They were never told of these costs when they checked out.\n\nThe counter-top was not burned, and I personally scrubbed the toilets and showers myself and they were spotless.  Upon calling \"PEGGY the Manager\" she was rude and promised photos  of the \"damage\".  I called her numerous times and was always told by Peggy she would call me back.  She indicated all kids don't clean their showers all year and they have to clean with special chemicals.  Peggy hangs up on me when I called her, hasn't provided any pictures. and is a very rude person.\n\nWhen my daughter moved in the windows had mold on them, the carpets were filthy which we had to clean to get her moved in.\n\nI have had 2 other sons who went to college and rented from numerous apartment complexes with never this kind of issue.\n\nI would encourage kids and their parents NOT TO RENT from Maple APTS.",

        "review": "I have lived in Maple Park Apartments for about twelve years now and while I have visited and investigated many other apartments over the years, I have never found one that could outshine Maple Park Apartments. I did a lot of research before moving here in 2005 and research has proven time and again over the years that this is a wonderful place to live in Bellingham. And much has improved over the past year.\n\nIt's true you're going to pay more at MPA than the average apartment in Bellingham, but the average apartment in Bellingham doesn't have what Maple Park has to offer: on-site fast-responding and professional maintenance and office team (some are new, all are very friendly and hard-working), very pet-friendly, covered parking (you'll be so happy when it snows) with spare spaces for guests, in-unit washer/dryer machine, safe neighborhood, pool, hot tub, workout room, outdoor BBQ and gazeebo area, kids playground, beautiful landscaping (blackberries in the summer!), office that will safely hold packages, and incredible proximity to the WWU park and ride/bus shuttle, WTA bus lines, the interstate, Downtown Bellingham, grocery stores, coffee, parks, and you're not a 10-minute drive to Western itself. You're about 12 minutes' drive from Fairhaven, 12 minutes from Meridian, 15 minutes from north Bellingham. So again, all things considered, you might be paying a little bit more at MPA, but you're paying for the phenomenal staff, the amenities, and all these great conveniences.\n\nThe apartments are reasonably spacious. There are heaters in the living room and bedrooms and some units have a fireplace. Many of the apartments (I know the 1BR/1BA and the 2BR/2BA) have walk in closets and all of the units have generous storage. You can pay a small fee for additional garage storage. The kitchen has a full oven, four burners, a microwave, a fridge, and a dishwasher. You get a tub and a shower (big ol' tub in the single units). There's a balcony with patio storage.\n\nI have lived in three of the units and all were clean, free of bugs (I am an extremely afraid of bugs so this is important to me), and decent quietness -- more so in the single units. I'm not very bothered by the normal sounds of people living around me (especially in a college town), but I'm not hearing any wild and crazy parties and everything is reasonably quiet after 10pm.\n\nI've visited friends and have looked at other places to live in Bellingham over the years and I'm convinced Maple Park Apartments has so much more to offer than most of Bellingham. I have to be honest, I've read the negative reviews and I think they're really off the mark. I have been here for a LONG time, moved from out of state when I was starting WWU back in 2005, and I just love this place. Love the staff. Much has improved over the last year (renovations, new office and maintenance staff, etc.), so take those older reviews with a huge grain of salt. Maple Park is really a gem and they're always doing everything they can to make their tenants happy and improve the overall experience.",

        "review": "Do not move into this apartment complex. The manager, Peggy, is the rudest person I have ever met. She always has this angry look on her face, never talks in a nice tone, and spends all her time online shopping. Customer service is non-existent with this lady. Our washer/dryer set started leaking in January of this year. After countless time of going down to the office and reporting it, it was never fixed. The maintenance manager took a used washer/dryer unit and put it into our apartment as a \"fix\" to the problem. The washer/dryer still leaks and now our dishwasher leaks. Save yourself the $1500 for a three-bedroom and go somewhere else. The apartments are out-dated and overpriced.",
