        "review": "THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! DO NOT MOVE HERE I BEG YOU!\nThis place is an absolute nightmare, and was before we moved in, and continues to be.\nI couldn't scratch the surface of how bad this place was, but to give you context it was about $800 a month per person, and we lived there for about a year.\n\n-AWFUL communication from the multiple people who owned the property (I think there were 3 companies that owned in in less than a year). The emergency line (on multiple occasions) went unanswered, they just really don't care.\n\n-The apartments themselves SUCK. Not only are they small, but the design makes no sense. We had no living room/living space, and had no openable windows in the main area.\n\n-There is no upkeep to the property. This place is the definition of \"don't fix it, paint over it\". In the winter, there was a broken waterpipe that made accessing the parking lot dangerous -they didn't fix it for weeks.\n\n-No one who works there has any clue what they're doing (expect for Carl and Niko, who are awesome). Probably due to the management constantly changing, no one is ever able to give you a straight answer on anything -that is if you can even reach them. You call, you email, you can visit the office. Most of the time, they will not answer your calls (even if you leave a message), and are almost never at the office during office hours.\n\n-My roommates and I were tricked and lied to when it came to our lease. When we signed the lease, we were signing a lease for 5 bedrooms. AFTER we signed the lease, they told us no 5 bedroom apartments were available, so we ended up having to split up. We were totally tricked/trapped.\n\n-The security deposit was $200. After emailing and calling SEVERAL people, I finally got my deposit back about a month after moving out. When I got it, they had taken out $85 for maintenance and cleaning. WHAT?? Not only was the apartment FILTHY when we arrived, we also deep cleaned it before leaving. There was absolutely no damage, so there is no reason that money should've been taken out.\n\n-For weeks in the Winter, and Spring the fire alarms would go off for minutes at a time. Everyone would have to pack up themselves and their pets to move out into the parking -only for the fire department to tell us that there was no fire, but faulty equipment. THIS HAPPENED PROBABLY 10 TIMES ALTOGETHER.\n\n-Consistently bad wifi, no place to set up cable or internet in the main area\n\n-No circulation (food goes bad pretty fast)\n\n-Laundry cost $4 a load. The machines are disgusting and never get cleaned, same with the dryers that usually don't dry your stuff properly. It's ridiculous we have to pay at all.\n\n-Of course, rent is expensive everywhere, but to have the audacity to charge so much money for such an HORRENDOUS place to live is criminal.\n\nPlease don't move here, I promise you'll regret it.",

        "review": "The PTLA Property Management company bought this property took over it as of YESTERDAY and I'm already upset. They gave notice yesterday in the EVENING on a FRIDAY about a bunch of things changing, didn't answer 8+ voice calls or messages even though their office claimed to still be open for multiple hours. Now they're out the entire weekend and ALSO THE MONDAY cause it's a holiday, and they have changed due date for rent to TUESDAY! So essentially they have made it impossible to contact them about these issues and any questions at all.\n\nAnd reading other reviews for PTLA it is highly obvious they never answer phone calls, and they have yet to provide a single email address that will actually reply. HORRIFIC customer service, especially for a new property they've taken on.\n\nViking Gardens is about to go downhill fast.",

The staff here is extremely unable to communicate in reasonable ways regarding money. This keeps me from giving this living space a good review.",

        "review": "I didn't have functional internet for the first 6 months I lived there. I complained relentlessly, went into the office frequently and didn't receive help until the pandemic, when I was sassed by a staff member for requesting internet during the pandemic. My only response was \"uhh I'm working from home now so yeah, I really need internet.\" Their staff has the combined intelligence of a fence post. They should probably investigate the office for a leak of some sort, you go in there and it's like they've been huffing fumes. Overpriced, cheap construction (expect to hear your roommates talk through the walls) and absolute worst treatment I've ever had by any land management company. I truly hope this business goes under for the greater good of renters. Pick anything else. Please",

        "review": "I've lived here for over 2 years, its a good location and decent apartment. The price is a little high but not terrible. The worst thing is they recently changed the internet, so there is no wired connection anymore, they just decided to disable the connections in the walls so they no longer work. There is only shotty WiFi instead. So now they are charging me higher rent for the same apartment and worse internet. I talked to the staff and they said they have no plans to improve the internet situation.\n\nUpdate (drop to 1 star): WiFi is getting worse, cuts out every hour, everyone in my apartment has tried talking to management but they refuse to fix the situation.",

        "review": "This is a fair review, it may never see the light of day on their own site... as described in the Terms and Conditions... They own the data the moment I hit the send button. Sooo if they own it they can decide if it is published for all to see ;)  \n\nWARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNIING\n\nMy largest hope is that prospective tenants READ the terms and conditions prior to signing a lease. \n\nThe important point is that these units are rented \"as is\".\nThere web portal is \"as is\" and they take no responsibility for it's security or integrity- if it fails any litmus, they are held harmless!!! This is all available for review in their terms and conditions.\n\nNow for the condition of the units - I say units as I have been privileged to be invited into several occupied units.\n\nPLEASE READ: \n1) The units are old and worn out. \n2) The appliances are old and worn out. \n3) The kitchen counters are simply painted plywood. \n4) There is mold, water-leaks, rotting and decaying building components, silverfish, animal feces, provided internet does not have enough bandwidth to retrieve email... Just a partial list.\n5) The laundry machines (they do not own - however they get rent and or a kickback for usage) The machines are in various states of operation and when operating will cost $8 to $22 per load, that's a load of wash and the same load to dry. Ended up purchasing a drying rack for the apartment as the clothing is not dry after spending an average of $20. Also there are NO REFUNDS and NO ASSISTANCE when either the washer or dryer stops working in the middle of a cycle. \n6) The apartment was FILTHY when I arrived, it was so bad, sticky, moldy, worn out that it required deep cleaning before I could move in. I took photos of the mold and other concerns - I was told that they are not responsible for mold, the implication is that I created the mold ? Are you serious? The photos are from prior to me moving in, how could I be responsible for existing mold? Lastly, I needed to wait for a week before it was available as they claimed they were cleaning and painting (I don't believe this at all)\n7) These concerns have been reported multiple times without a timely response and without action after weeks of waiting. \n\n**The complex is on their third \"management company\" in less than a year.... HHmmmm, more than likely to limit their liability. \n\nCaution to future tenants, READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS before signing a lease. \n\nYou may wonder why we rented this apartment if some or all of these issues existed. We were two weeks away from the start of a new school year and should have been suspicious that they had availability when almost no one else did. Also, this was done over the phone and through photos as we are from out of town and traveling round trip on short notice was not an option. \n\nAlmost NO COMMUNICATION fro the front office. Probably due to the management constantly changing, no one is ever able to give you a straight answer on anything -that is if you can even reach them. You call, you email, you can visit the office. Most of the time, they will not answer your calls (even if you leave a message), and are almost never at the office during office hours.",

My apartment was not cleaned whatsoever at the time of move in. Their deposit system is trash. Worst of all is parking. You either pay 25 dollars a month on top of rent which is already too high or most days there is nowhere to park. The wifi is too expensive and fucking trash and incredibly slow. Live anywhere else. NXNW is 100 more per month but better in virtually every way. You will save the extra money you are spending at NXNW solely by the fact that WIFI is included there and that laundry is free there. Laundry at this complex is 3.5 dollars per wash. \n\nAlso, my bathroom floor was dilapidated and had black mold growing over the place at the time of move in. They took several days to get it fixed. My biggest regret is not suing them and calling the health department when this happened. Don't live here.",

For new residents, the move-in procedure is frequently praised as efficient and considerate, making the transition into the community pleasant. Many residents appreciated the colorful ambiance and friendly staff interactions, citing the service as easy and accommodating. Several reviews emphasized that staff members were attentive and quick to address any issues raised, reflecting a commitment to providing satisfactory customer service. Anecdotes from users further suggested that some aspects, such as the location and cleanliness of the apartments, improved their overall experience.<section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>For those who enjoyed their time at Viking Gardens Apartments, the proximity to campus and the accommodating management stood out as significant benefits. Parents of students residing there noted the convenience and suitability of the apartments for college life, with clean facilities and responsive management. Even though the buildings are older, management's efforts to maintain them were appreciated by occupants. Some reviewers were particularly impressed by the maintenance team, which was described as both responsive and helpful, ensuring that any issues were addressed promptly. For many residents, the welcoming atmosphere and supportive community formed by the diligent management enhanced their living experience, contributing positively to their time at Viking Gardens.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite a few positive comments, the majority of reviews for Viking Gardens Apartments reflect a challenging living experience for many tenants. Numerous user reviews bemoaned inadequate communication from the management and the inconsistency in addressing maintenance requests. For instance, one tenant reported that the office staff often seemed unhelpful and unwelcoming, making it difficult to resolve issues in person. Several residents experienced multiple management changes within a short span, leading to further confusion and miscommunication. Additionally, the lack of timely responses to urgent maintenance concerns, such as broken water pipes and faulty fire alarms, led to frustration among residents. Another consistent complaint involved unreliable internet services, with frequent outages affecting tenants who needed constant connectivity for work or study purposes. These recurring issues resulted in low satisfaction and critical views towards the management practices at Viking Gardens.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most serious grievances at Viking Gardens Apartments extend beyond mere inconvenience to potentially hazardous and deceptive practices. One alarming concern raised by multiple reviews involves the misleading lease agreements and difficulty retrieving security deposits. Some tenants claimed to have been misled about the availability of certain apartment configurations, feeling trapped after signing their leases. Moreover, residents often found their security deposits unfairly withheld due to alleged maintenance issues that were disputed by the tenants. Health and safety concerns were also rampant, with instances of mold, dilapidated bathrooms, and persistent black mold reported during initial move-in without prompt remediation. Additionally, multiple residents encountered severe communication lapses, particularly regarding urgent issues over weekends or holidays when the management was unreachable. The negative experiences in these reviews paint a troubling picture of the management's handling of tenant relations and property upkeep.</p></section>"
