          "text": "We apologize for any confusion during the renewal process. All parties on the lease need to complete the lease signing by the renewal deadline in order to receive that renewal offer pricing. Additionally, we are continuing strict pest management measures at the property and will monitor it closely. We hope we have been able to resolve your concerns to your satisfaction and look forward to improving your experience."

        "review": "It took them months to fix a door that was broken when I moved in, and they continued contacting me for weeks after it was replaced to ask if I still needed it fixed. There are cracks in the ceiling and dents in the walls that were not marked on the move in inspection, so expect to document everything floor to ceiling if you want your deposit back. My toilet and kitchen outlets will randomly stop working and maintenance does nothing to fix either issue, just telling us to \"call if it gets worse\". The on-site washers/dryers are expensive for how poorly they clean, are out of service 90% of the time, and have ripped up my roommates clothes twice. You can find a unit in downtown Bham for half the cost and twice the charm.",

Your rent will go up every year while living conditions go down the hole. Any tenant is accepted, so expect fights, parties, aggressive dogs off leash, and every weekend no parking.",

        "review": "When Monterra took over they definitely could tell Cambridge Square needed a lot of tlc. While some have complained about the construction, it all needed to be done in order to fix and update the units and get rid of all the mold. It is refreshing to finally see our rent money go towards a better (and healthier) living experience. Andrew is a kind and thoughtful property manager to have around the community as well. He always makes sure the residents are happy here.",

        "review": "This has been by far the worst property management company I have ever dealt with. They absolutely do not care about thier current tennants and only about bringing new unknowing clientele. I have lived here peacefully for nearly 2 years and it wasnt until Montera took over that life here has just been on issue after another with this place. We have had belongings stolen and where told it wasnt thier problem, they change the laundry from $2 to $3.50 per load yet the dryer is no bigger so basicly doubling the price, they will have jack hammers and leaf blowers going on before 9 am. So to anyone who works nights, your screwed on sleep. And not to mention to crazy lady that im sure plenty of people have complain,ed about. All in all Monntera apartments is only her to get you in and take your money so they can pay for all these maintenance changes and charge you even more for an apartment that is no better than before on the inside. This place has no regard for its current tennants and the life style they have been accustomed to in their own homes. Shame!",

We are truly sorry that you are displeased with the processes so far at the community and encourage you to stop by the leasing office to discuss it further in person.\n\nWe are sorry to hear about the theft that occurred and encourage you to report to the police and to our office staff.\n\nWe are currently making some great changes at Monterra to do some needed updating to the community. This includes updating the laundry facilities. We see that the laundry pricing was set incorrectly and will adjust through our provider to better meet our residents' needs.\n\nWe are doing construction on resident stairwells & walkways, landscaping, interior renovations in some homes, and an exterior resident lounge area.  We do realize that construction work schedules may not coincide with some of our residents' schedules, and we do apologize for the inconvenience this causes.\n\nWe truly appreciate your patience during the remodeling process and encourage any feedback on how we can better communicate the work schedules to our residents."

        "review": "The absolute worst management Ive dealt with living in Bellingham. I thought the shaddiness and scheming landmark was bad, this is the worst experience Ive had. I am getting woke up before 9 AM because of a jack hammer and because of a LEAF BLOWER. WHY? They also decide to shut the water off before the times they say they are going to shut them off, people need water to get ready to work and go to school! We had huge pot holes for a month or more! Theyve remodeled our laundry situation. They told us that these new machines would have all these cool features and that they wouldnt be coin operated. After not being able to do our laundry during the switch, the new machines do not have all that was promised and ARE MORE EXPENSIVE NOW THAN BEFORE. Almost double on the price to do a load of laundry!! And not every floor is hooked up so you will traverse multiple floors just to do laundry. Ive been very communicative with this management and I have not received a single email back from them. I could go on and on about this place but I would end up writing a book. This has been almost 6 months of chaos and distruption in our lives since the new management. I would not recommend.\nEdit: THE LEAF BLOWER TOOK LESS THAN 30 MINUTES. Woke the whole complex up before 9 am, amazing planning.",

Unfortunately, these are operations that are necessary to maintain and improve our community. We recognize, however, that this can be extremely frustrating. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us to discuss this issue.\n\nWe recently repaired the potholes at the community, and we are in the process of remedying the issues with our new laundry machines through our service provider. Our priority is making Monterra a great place to live for all our residents, and we appreciate your feedback as we work to improve."

        "review": "Welcome to Monterra Apartments. Monterra has plummeted downhill over the past few years especially now since Andrew, the only redeeming factor of this place has left and I don't blame him. I would recommend moving here in a few years time once the leaks have been minimized to twice a day. That is of course If you can find anywhere to park and are not blinded by the horrendous blue color that monterra was recently painted. By moving here you WILL become much much uglier as you will be waking up at 8am every day due to leaf blowers, construction cranes and complimentary roofing nails which you will find in the parking lot. Luckily I am so adapted to the sound of construction that I know my different machinery and can now work for the local construction company. If you can manage to read this message over the incessant yelling, hammering and beeping or are deaf this is the ideal place for you. Welcome!",

We do our best to be considerate of residents by containing construction to the hours of 8:00am-6:00pm, but we know that doesnt work with every residents schedule, and we are working diligently to get these projects completed as soon as possible. Our residents satisfaction is our goal, and we would love to have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with you directly.

        "review": "THIS IS A DANGEROUS PLACE TO LIVE. Was a decent place while Landmark still owned it, and I never imagined Id have a good thing to say about those clowns. Theres a woman living in the complex who, I can say without exaggeration, terrorizes the community all hours of the day at random. Many of the residents are students and expect to live in a place that is reasonably quiet at, say, 1-3AM, but not Monterra at Cambridge Square. Management has been made aware of the situation and have delivered eviction notice after the woman assaulted a resident. Pursue a lease at this address if you are interested in having an unstable neighbor: pound on your door and windows with a crowbar attempting to break into your apartment at any hour, leave burning candles in public spaces over spilt alcohol, scream at the absolute top of her lungs sporadically troughout the day, leave garbage and random objects at your door and strewn about the property, and potentially attack you on your way in or out of the building. The list of her insane antics is over a mile long. Management is dealing with the issue but legal action is slow and in the meantime we have to live with this daily terror. STUDENTS AND FAMIIES: DO NOT MOVE HERE OR LET YOUR CHILD LIVE HERE. IT IS A DANGEROUS PLACE AND POLICE INTERVENTION/LEGAL INTERVENTION HAS DONE NOTHING OVER THE LAST MONTH TO MAKE IT SAFE. She was arrested for attacking police officers at Starving sams down the street and for drug possession, but since her release has returned to Cambridge square and has begun to terrorize everyone again. I cannot wait to terminate my lease and urge ANY potential renter to avoid this place like the plague. It has been an absolute nightmare.",
