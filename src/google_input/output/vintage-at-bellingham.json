        "review": "I met with Jackie and she explained the apartment application process in clear understandable language but also with warmth and clarity about the property and how living at Vintage might be for me. On the tour she showed me everything and every where, even the trash room (which was clean and freshly scrubbed). When we passed other residents they greeted each other and it was evident Jackie has a great relationship with them. The building is in excellent shape even taking in its age; No obvious wear and tear or deferred maintenance. I am looking forward to a future with my dog living at Vintage Bellingham.",

        "review": "The facility looked nice from the outside, but a completely undeserved rude reception this morning from the office manager was a turn off. Dour and unfriendly from the first words out of her lips, to potential new residents no less, is a key indicator of how they operate normally. Yes, we were let in by friendly residents after they saw us struggling to get an answer from the front call button first (which the manager bluntly admitted she didn't answer).   We live by the Golden Rule so were shocked at being treated so coldly for no reason.  We quickly left and found very friendly walk-in receptions at both Spring Creek and Affinity.   I don't normally post comments, but felt anyone looking here should be forewarned.",

          "text": "I'm sorry that you felt that way.  We are a secure community for the benefits of our residents.  You followed people in and when I asked you about it, you misrepresented yourself and chose to leave rather than visiting with me.  We protect our residents and their privacy.  If you would like to set an appointment and visit further please call me at 360-715-0871. Thank you!"

        "review": "My mother moved into the Vintage at Bellingham 4.5 years ago and it has been a blessing. There is a real family feel here and the community is so supportive and caring of each other. The apartments are very nice with multiple floor plans to choose from. The laundry and garbage are conveniently located on each floor. The grounds are beautiful and it's relaxing to sit on your balcony or in the gazebo by the flower garden and enjoy nature. Jackie the manager does an amazing job of organizing events for the residents and the Seahawks rallies are a favorite. She is helpful to the community in every way!! David the maintenance supervisor keeps the building in great working order. Jackie and David work so hard to make the Vintage at Bellingham a wonderful place to live. I would recommend it to anyone!",
