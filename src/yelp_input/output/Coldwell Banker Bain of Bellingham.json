      "review": "The only reason I was able to navigate - and survive - the process of buying a house in Bellingham and selling a house in Seattle (in that order) was having Anne Cantrell at my side. Her experience, coaching and advice helped me find the perfect house, on the market only three days, with 11 offers, all over asking price; the seller commented that I had the best agent. She also helped me, in a softening Seattle market, to price and show my house such that I received an offer within one week. Superlatives are insufficient to describe my gratitude and appreciation for Anne's expertise.",
