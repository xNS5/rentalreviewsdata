        "review": "I have absolutely loved my time as a tenant under DCI Properties! Kristen is great and easy to work with, a truly kind person, and she does an awesome job of remaining in communication with all of her tenants. The apartment I rented was outstanding, at a very reasonable price! In addition, her father (who does maintenance at the properties) is a really friendly guy and responds quickly to any issues that may arise. No negatives that I can think, and I highly recommend!",

When our dishwasher went out they acted immediately, professionally , and  in a very polite manner. I would highly recommend them to absolutely everyone. You seriously will not find a better property management company around. My wife and I both consider ourselves to be very fortunate and that we found this amazing home with a wonderful yard to rent through them. You absolutely will not be disappointed with their service.",

        "review": "Like many people who are new to Bellingham and need to rent an apartment, I went to searching online for available apartments and seeing what reviews there were. Across the board most the apartments had a plethora of unsolicited 5-star reviews, lots of 1-stars, with averages running about 3. This made it really frustrating and hard to apply to, or even consider renting there (5-star ratings w/no comments, which turned out to be some properties giving $100 off rent or something similar to those who leave 5-star review). Eventually I came across Cedar Grove by DCI Prop. Management. Their reviews were/are in the 4-star range and the comments were solid ,so that was promising.\nAny who, I decided to give them a try and got some information very promptly from Ta. Return emails were quick, informative, and helpful. I asked a lot of questions and she was patient with me during this. Ultimately I decided to sign with them!\nEverything was done online, which was great considering I was 6-hours away and limited time to go up during the week. On move-in day I got. called from them to see when I'd be coming by to get my keys which was nice.\nTLDR; Responsive, nice, patient, and easy process. 5/5 would recommend.\n\nApartment itself was brand new an",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>The user reviews indicate DCI Property Management excels in maintaining their properties and promptly addressing tenant concerns. Multiple tenants praise Kristen and the maintenance team for their friendly and professional service. The communication lines between management and tenants remain open, fostering an environment in which issues like broken appliances are swiftly resolved. The reviews emphasize the overall kindness and dedication of the DCI staff, adding an element of reliability to their management style. Among the positive feedback is a tenant who rented an apartment at a reasonable price and mentioned both Kristen and her father maintained clear and consistent communication throughout their tenancy.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The exemplary service provided by DCI Property Management has earned it superlative praise in the user reviews. Tenants consider themselves fortunate to have found rental homes managed by DCI, citing experiences like immediate responses to maintenance issues and a generally positive rental experience. The company\u2019s organized approach to tenant management is evident in the glowing remarks from various tenants, many of whom highlight the personal touch brought by Kristen and her team. One tenant noted that even a delayed rent payment was handled with utmost professionalism, ensuring satisfaction and reinforcing a tenant-first approach. Another tenant detailed a smooth online leasing process, which was crucial given their remote location, showcasing DCI's adaptability to modern rental needs.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>In this article, despite an overwhelmingly positive set of reviews, there is room for potential improvement. With only one four-star review and no comments to accompany it, it's difficult to pinpoint any substantial negatives. However, the absence of any lower ratings could suggest a need for DCI to continuously strive to maintain their high standards to prevent any future lapses. It's essential for potential tenants to understand that while the reviews skew highly positive, the experiences described are subjective and might not perfectly align with everyone's expectations or experiences.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>In exploring the user reviews for DCI Property Management, there are virtually no negative experiences reported, which is a rarity in the property management industry. This lack of substantial critique could imply exceptional service or potentially, a lack of comprehensive feedback from a broader tenant base. Future tenants should still approach with the awareness that any small detail, such as the single four-star review without an elaborating comment, could hint at areas needing refinement. Maintaining open communication channels will be key for DCI to ensure that even the most minor issues do not accumulate into significant dissatisfaction. The company\u2019s robust owner responses to reviews further illustrate their commitment to tenant relationships, mitigating any possible downsides before they manifest.</p></section>"
