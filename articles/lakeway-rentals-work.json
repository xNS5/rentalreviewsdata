Another friend rented a house from them that had mushrooms growing out of the wall behind the toilet and then when they moved out and left the house in better shape than it was when they started renting, Lakeway tried to keep their deposit and the had to get a lawyer involved to get their money back. The owner guy does not like to talk to women, when I was in with my boyfriend I would ask him questions and he would answer to my boyfriend.",

They do not care about tenants and will leave you without a working dryer for months. Without heat in the winter. Their organization with finances and payments is terrible. They'll tell you that you haven't paid when you have and they never gave our security deposit back, even though they said they would.

They WILL take advantage of you at every corner and not do a thing about it.\n\nMaintenance requests are always ignored, the staff act like the tenants are the bad guys, and much more. We had no heat in the middle of the winter while our house was 30, we didnt have a working toilet for 4 days, and we are currently on week 4 of not having a working kitchen sink or dishwasher. And now it is an even bigger issue. They refuse to call contractors (who are actually helpful) and even hang up on tenants on the phone.\n\nWhatever you do. DO NOT RENT FROM LAKEWAY REALTY!

        "review": "Rent is expensive. Living standards are terrible. They ignore all work orders until the next tenants come to look at your house. First day we moved in there was a leak from the shower that came into the downstairs living room and it took them two weeks to even come in and look at it. Our dryer has been broken the entire time living here (we put it on the original work order when you first move in/water doesn't exit the house it pours in throughout the house leaving it damp) and has yet to be fixed. STILL. They said they will now because I mentioned it in front of the other tenants. I am beyond frustrated with this company. Also, our house was completely wrecked the first time we moved in, garbage, dust, and bottles of vodka littered the environment telling me that they hadn't even done a walkthrough. The one thing I am glad is Lakeway Realty taught me to do proper research before.",

Its been 3 months since the maintenance guy has gone to the store for supplies to fix our fallen down fence and never returned. Its been 4 months since we moved in and NOTHING on our move in inspection has been repaired, nor have we even been contacted about repairing despite our best efforts to get in touch. It took them 3 months to pay the last tenants overdue water bill, and they only paid after we contacted the city.\n\nTheyve made one thing perfectly clear since moving in: they will be sweet and pleasant until you sign a lease with them, and then you mean less to them than the dirt in the corners of their rental properties. You will be called rude and ungrateful for asking them to do their job. They will call you entitled and then ignore you (for asking to fix holes in the wall). They will lie straight to your face and tell you your unit has been cleaned when they hand you the keys when no one has set foot on the property since the last tenants moved out. I moved in with fake eyelashes left on the windowsills, hair stuck to the shower wall, stains and dog hair on the floor. If you still get roped into renting from them, get used to being treated like youre scum, because you are to Lakeway Reality.",

        "review": "I know there are plenty of low ratings for this company, and so I wanted to write one once I was completely done with my move out and my deposit refund. I have received 90 percent of my deposit back (10% from battery replacement, and bulbs etc) with an amount of overpaid rent for that month. I've never had a problem with this company. I was more than pleased with the services provided. Cheri was always on top of my requests, and my concerns were always addressed in a very timely manner (if not almost immediately). I just graduated college so at the time I was a student, and I can honesty say I never felt taken advantage of; however, I will mention that I was very careful to not damage the property, I turned the apt in after a thorough cleaning day, and I had my payments on auto-payments so there would be no question about it. Cheri is a very kind woman, when I signed my lease they were very patient with my paper work, and the only occasion I had an issue with one of my neighbors I felt fully supported by Cheri.\n\nI would simply suggest that you take pictures, and video recordings of before moving in and after you're done packing and cleaning. I feel for anyone who has experienced otherwise, but I said I would give this place a try and write a review once I moved out so here I am. Thank you Lakeway rentals, I enjoyed my time living in Bellingham.",

        "review": "Lots of friends renting from these guys.  If you have a choice, avoid them at all costs.  Most houses have atleast one major plumbing issue on top of the lack of proper door knobs/locks.  Mold can be a major issue. One of their roommates window panes fell out last winter and its just been a gaping hole since.  No foul play, just a rotten window frame. They had to take it upon themselves to patch it with plywood because lakeway wouldnt respond with much more than acknowledgment.  Keep an eye on your account too, they have been known to double charge for rent and make it a complete hassle to get your money squared away.  Slumlord doesnt begin to describe their business practices. City should really step up and condemn half their rentals.",

After fighting with them constantly I was able tl find a molded rotten apartment in disrepair with no washer or dryer and no dishwasher and terrible neighbors all at the price of 1100. When it snowed they refused to clear the snow so disabled people could get out of their homes. It takes a couple months for maintenance requests too. The people there are often rude and even hang up. They have no voicemail or maintenance number and aren't open on the weekend. No on site property management.",

She has a fun sense of humor that you have to understand.\n\nHowever, Jo Anne, the accountant, has no idea how to track rent and she will trick you into paying double your rent. She has gone through our statements multiple times and has come up with different answers every single time. We have our bank statements and everything and she is still accusing us of not paying our rent. On top of this, she threatens to evict us every week with these accusations. She doesnt know how to keep track of rent or who has paid what. She has accused my roommates of owing over $1,000 when we have bank statements showing that we have paid fully for each months rent. I have paid the same amount each month (which is an equal portion of the houses full rent) and she continues to say that I have over paid (when that doesnt make any sense if you look at the records). Beware, she will mess up your charges and threaten you (in all caps).",

Again and again I was treated terribly.\nWhen I first moved in, they claimed the unit had been cleaned, but there was mold in the fridge and freezer and on the window sills.  The bath tub was brown with dirt. The painters had tracked in dirt and crushed berries onto the floor and carpet.  I notified them that this was unacceptable and they told me they would send the cleaners again.  The cleaners did not do anything.\nLater in my stay here, management had put a sign on the laundry room door notifying tenants that they were entering some units on a specified date.  It was not posted individually and I did not see the notice until after the date had passed.\nThe locked mailboxes were in disrepair and were broken into.  The post office held the entire complex's mail, but management did not bother to tell tenants.\nTheir actions are unprofessional and unacceptable.\nWhen I moved out, I left the place cleaner than it had been on my arrival.  I received my deposit about a month after moving out, minus bogus charges for replacing brand new CO2 and fire alarms.  The invoice they attached included the employee complaining about \"traffic to lowe's\" which was across the street from the apartment.  They charged me 69$ to replace the alarms which were in excellent, working condition when I left.  When I emailed and called and requested to speak with the manager, I was treated rudely and dismissed, never being able to speak with him.  They claimed my file was closed and I would not get my money back.",

We had a multitude of issues that were never fixed, we asked to get our plumbing looked at because our shower wasnt working at the time, they proceeded to send a plumber in the following days. We had moved out before the job was done, they then claimed that we cut holes in the wall and tore out the faucet and that we owed them for the damages. I was in a constant game of phone tag for about a year with this company while they told me lies about being 3rd in line for a dispute and that they would put my paperwork on the top of the stack tomorrow morning. Years went by after they said they would not send my bill to collections. Today I got a call that said I have 24 days to pay what I owe or it will affect my credit. Even when the law states that I should receive 60 days notice (besides the point). DO NOT GET INTO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY! It should be criminal what they do.",

One of the times I was waiting, I heard her talking to someone else who worked there and they were trashing tenants. They also SAID THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE THE WHOLE DEPOSIT BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE IT.  This is HIGHLY illegal.  If you ever don't get your deposit back, demand to see an itemized list AND receipts of the work done.  They clearly make it up.  If you rent from them, document everything, take tons of photos of the whole unit and mark down every bit of damage when you move in.  Honestly, if everyone did that and banded together, it would be possible yo sur them for all the money they have taken from people.  When I first moved in, they gave me the wrong key for the laundry room 3 different times.  Also, my toilet was missing everything on the inside .... and they knew about it and didn't fix it before letting me move in.  Then, they took 8 hours to fix it.  I kept having to drive to the store to pee.  Also, Cheri was unbelievably disrespectful to my mother, who co-signed for me.  And my mother is the sweetest lady on earth.  I think Cheri hates herself because she has a log shoved so far up her ass that she really is just yelling at people for help to pull it out.",

        "review": "Theres probably 100 bad things I could say about lakeway reality. I lived in a large home with 5 other roommates and the house was built very cheap. Upon move in, while installing our internet we noticed a VERY bad flea infestation. So bad the carpet downstairs appeared to be moving. Fleas were jumping all over the hard wood floor, you wouldnt want to see the sticky traps we had to set. HUNDREDS of fleas. Quite interesting to experience this when Lakeway continued to tell us it was flea bombed several times. We had to buy flea bombs and even have an exterminator powder with harsh chemicals. It was almost a month before the flea problem subsided. The house seemed very nice with large spacious rooms and modern touches until you realize you cant even use the dishwasher properly. It would leak and leak on most washes. We had contacted lakeway to have a repair man check it out and they had said they sent someone who interesting enough never arrived. All of the appliances were faulty. The oven took forever to heat, the fridge would leak and the dryer would release moisture into the laundry room. Over all terrible. Not to mention the witch at the front desk was always incredibly rude to us. We were promised a smart TV with sign on to the lease and 3 of us had to call several times about the TV. Only to have an unexpected visit to the house from Cheri with the TV that was a brand none of us had seen and wasnt even Smart so we ended up not using it. We have all moved out and had just received our remainder of our damage deposit and feel we were unfairly returned what we paid. We were charged for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors that worked already, cleaning fees which are understandable and just a bunch of random nonsense which are all probably an excuse. Youre all probably better off sleeping on the street before renting from lakeway reality.",

I was able to correct this but still, very conniving. Then on move out they charged me for about $1000 in fees for different things that I know for a fact were never done to the place as my friends moved into the house and I have been back there frequently since move out. They also falsified documents on my girlfriends house and tried to charge her $3000 14 months after she had moved out of her house. They legally only have 21 days to do this but decided to falsify some documents to make it possible. She also called the collection agency and apparently they did this to over 30 different houses. Luckily my girlfriend took them to court and only ended up paying about $750, but still, incredibly un professional. Also two years ago my friends lived in a house that was having electrical problems and they had asked lakeway to come and fix it numerous times but it was never done. The house burned down from an electrical fire a few weeks later and all of there stuff was destroyed. My friend had to withdraw from his quarter at western which cost him a bunch of money not to mention all of his belongings were destroyed and he was left homeless. Lakeway realty is the worst company I have ever come across in my life by far and they should pay for all of the terrible stuff they have done. Sadly college students dont know or care to deal with it, especially since its their familys money. Also a lot of the time there is no other housing and so they have to go with lakeway.",

We have contacted lakeway every week since we moved in and despite having an infant in the home, they dont seem to care about the infestation at all. I have contacted the city, housing advisors, pest control, housing inspector, and lakeway many times and no one is able to help us unless the landlord wants to help. Well this has been going on for months, and going to court is just about the only thing we havent tried yet. Best advice: avoid Lakeway like the plague their staff is super unprofessional, and they dont care about human beings only a paycheck. It breaks my heart to see people treat others like this, its shameful and grotesque. We have had many problems with the house: mold, water damage, animal feses, old water heater, broken dryer, broken heat, etc. but the squirrels take the cake.

EDITED FOR CHARACTER SPACES PERMITTED!\n\nShe immediately discovered leaks &water intrusion in her room, the bathroom upstairs, the bathroom downstairs, the kitchen,etc. How u can justify just re-renting a house that is leaking beyond my understanding.   I'm confident that, according to the Landlord Tenant Act, you are required to offer a home that is habitable -- living in a home with water intrusion & the black mold it causes is far from being habitable.  It's now June, 2017, & these students are STILL dealing with water intrusion, leaks, black mold & the health issues from being subjected to these conditions for over 9 months!   At one point, a handyman was sent to check it out, but never followed through on this issue. As were the several other attempts to resolve this problem early on!  As her landlord, certainly u r aware that u r required 2 offer ur tenants a clean & healthy place 2 live/breath!  This home is far from the habitable place that 1 would expect.\n\nI will address the water intrusion/leaks again below, but it has come to our attention that my daughter was walked in on in her private bedroom (usually padlocked when she isn't home) when Cheri was showing the place to future potential tenants the other day!  Months and months before their lease is even up!  As a parent in today's crazy world climate, surely you can understand how that would be completely and absolutely unacceptable!  I don't care what the circumstances are, or how many unreceived posts you posted, it is not acceptable to just walk into their private home and certainly into their private bedrooms.  These are young, vulnerable women, and I am stunned that this is how you do business!  To add further insult to injury, Cheri was rude and hung up on me when I called to confront her.\n\nI just had the displeasure of reading your (horrible) reviews on Google Reviews ... all 31 of them, and the theme is always the same!  I'm appalled you stay in business.  Taking advantage of young adults who are in college trying to get an education is not only deplorable, it disgusts me to my very core!\n\nMoving on ... as I stated in my phone conversation with Cheri, if anyone EVER and I mean EVER enters my daughters private bedroom again without her EXPRESS WRITTEN OR VERBAL CONSENT, you will be hearing back from our family lawyer.\n\nThe damage this unattended, yet frequently reported water intrusion/leaks has caused our child to have health issues relating to black mold, not to mention anxiety from worrying about these arising issues.  We are seeking reimbursement for deductibles paid out to health care providers for said issues.\n\nFurther, because of said unattended leaks, I am, effective immediately, giving Hannah Manchel's notice of intent to vacate her room and return home so I can properly attend to the health issues caused by ignored water intrusion.   She will be out by July 1, 2017.  I am seeking hotel reimbursement for her from June 15th until June 30, 2017 as well.     June 1st payment was the last payment you will receive from us because of all these horrible issues you have forced my child to live with.  If there is a problem with this, I will need to know in writing by June 19, 2017.   Otherwise, on advice from our council, we are, effective immediately, putting in our request for early release from her contract with no consequences.  The last month's rent and the deposit we gave at the beginning of this nightmare is requested back as well ... I personally left that house in better shape than when they walked through the doors, and the contractor that helped us out the other day said there was black mold covering the entire home due to ignored water intrusion!  Again, this home is not a habitable occupancy for anyone to live in.",

This was my first apartment and I definitely learned the hard way. Take detailed pictures of any unit you rent from these guys, upon move in, and again upon move out. If you don't, they will make up elaborate stories and you can say goodbye to your deposit. In my case, it was a dented garage door, and claims that someone had fired off a high-powered weapon in the upstairs bedroom, and their repair guy almost fell through the floor because of it. None of this was accurate, but I had not taken pictures.\n\nYou have been warned.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite the overwhelming number of negative reviews surrounding Lakeway Rentals, a few tenants have shared positive experiences. There are users who noted that they received their deposits back in a fair manner, with one stating they got back 90% of their deposit after a thorough move-out process. This suggests that for some careful renters who maintain good relations and document their experiences properly, there may be a possibility for satisfactory resolutions regarding deposits.</p><p>Additionally, a few reviews mention the staff, particularly one manager, as being friendly and helpful, which highlights that not all interactions with the company are negative. One tenant shared that their maintenance requests were handled quickly and that they always felt treated with respect during their time at Lakeway Rentals, suggesting that positive experiences may hinge on good communication and engagement with specific staff members.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Only a handful of reviews could be classified as \"great,\" reflecting positive experiences from long-term tenants. One user expressed gratitude for being treated with respect over their 11-year tenancy, noting that the staff are kind and responsive when tenants also show respect. This highlights the possibility that fostering good relationships with management can lead to satisfactory outcomes, suggesting a reciprocal dynamic that can exist in property management interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, experiences from a few satisfied customers highlight the management's responsiveness to maintenance requests and decent customer service. Despite the predominance of negative feedback, these exceptions indicate that, under certain circumstances, Lakeway Rentals can meet tenant expectations and provide a reasonable housing experience.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>The reviews reflecting a \"bad\" experience with Lakeway Rentals are numerous and alarming. Many tenants report severe issues with maintenance requests going ignored for weeks or even months. One user detailed that their home did not have functional heating for the entire winter, while another dealt with extensive plumbing issues that were not addressed until a lawyer was threatened. Such responses (or lack thereof) reveal a concerning trend of negligence towards tenant well-being and property upkeep.</p><p>Additionally, many users reported anxiety-inducing relationships with management, highlighting a lack of professionalism. Frequent allegations of being mistreated, hung up on, or receiving intimidation tactics contributes to an overall picture of a company that is dismissive of its tenants. This disconnect has led numerous former tenants to advise against renting from Lakeway Rentals, labeling them as irresponsible and dismissive of tenant concerns.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The \"ugly\" side of Lakeway Rentals is starkly represented in user reviews that unveil harrowing experiences with the company. For instance, some reviewers shared tragic accounts of suffering through hazardous living conditions, such as mold infestations or serious plumbing issues that went unaddressed for months. One tenant's home was noted to have significant mold that led to health problems, which ultimately forced them to seek legal assistance. This recklessness in property management exemplifies a frightening neglect of tenant health and safety.</p><p>Moreover, former clients frequently describe Lakeway as a \"slumlord\" operation, even implying that the company exploits college students with a lack of choice in a competitive rental market. Numerous accounts report unfair deductions from security deposits and unexpected charges that appear fraudulent or fabricated, as well as terrifying experiences that left tenants feeling trapped. The dissatisfaction surrounding Lakeway Rentals is amplified by claims of a toxic work environment, particularly relating to a specific manager who is noted for being verbally abusive, diminishing trust and promoting further distress among renters.</p></section>"
