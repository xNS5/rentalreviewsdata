Samantha and Danny were easy to work with and always responsive to any needs or concerns I had which were few if any. I appreciated the fact that they were dog friendly especially with a 76 lb lab which was not easy to find in Bellingham.nowadays The majority of places had so many restrictions but not them they worked with me and had no issue with my request. Also, their rental rates were fair and reasonable for such a nice apartment complex. I highly recommend Bellingham Green as a place to stay.",
