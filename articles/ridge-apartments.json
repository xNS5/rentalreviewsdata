        "review": "I have just about finished up my lease with The Ridge Bellingham and am sad to go. Many Bellingham renter companies are terrible and scam you for your money, but when renting with the private owner Lauren, I have had no issues. She replies very quickly with any questions and is very understanding. She has been patient and kind even when I was having trouble deciding if I was going to stay another year changing my mind back and fourth. That is an extremely frustrating thing for me to do, but she did not show one ounce of annoyance with me. Everything in these apartments were new as it was jusy built and we were the first renters. Very good price for what you get. Anything I needed fixed, she got someone in and out right away. My favorite thing is the soft close drawers and cabinets. If I could stay another year I would do it.",

        "review": "From last October, until a few weeks ago, I have had the pleasure of living at the Ridge. Although the common space is decidedly on the small side, the rooms are unusually spacious to make up for it: I comfortably fit my full-sized bed frame, a medium desk, and a full-sized, tall bookshelf in my room comfortably, and the space never felt cramped. The kitchen features reasonable amounts of counterspace and cupboard storage, as well as a full-sized fridge. The high ceilings, shiny new appliances, lovely marbled countertops and wooden floors, in conjunction with the complex's proximity to Sehome Village and major highways make this a *fabulous* and cost-effective alternative to dorm living! Your grocery store, cell phone carrier (T-Mobile), internet provider (Xfinity in Haggen), and Dollar Tree, to name a few, are all a ten minute walk away. Frankly, it's more difficult to name any kind of store that *isn't* within arms reach! Convenient on site parking is available for a small fee ($30 at the time of this writing).\n\nAlthough the property's condition, convenience, and interior aesthetics are prime selling points in and of themselves, one would be remiss to ignore the effective, gracious, and responsive management provided by Ridge Bellingham's own Lauren Kramer: In a fashion so unlike any other management company l've encountered, she will actually respond to your maintenance requests, set crystal-clear expectations about move-out cleanups, enforce parking permits, address noise complaints, and make a reasonable effort to ensure your compatibility with any roommates (so reasonable, in fact, that I *fell in love* with one of mine, but that's another story). These are just a few of the critical things that management here does very well, but above all, Lauren is communicative, fair, friendly, and can be counted on to handle questions and concerns in a timely fashion which demonstrates both professionalism and genuine empathy for The Ridge's tenants. The only reason I left is because I had grown out of the space and was ready to have my own apartment for the first time. In other words, the only thing that could have made my stay at The Ridge better would have been finding it as an even younger college student.\n\nAs far as student living goes, I am fairly convinced that no better combination of well-maintained living and overqualified management exists in this city. And I'm entirely convinced that it doesn't exist at this price.\n\n- Brandon and Stephanie",

Many have emphasized the convenience of being close to local stores, public transport, and Western Washington University. One tenant specifically mentioned the ideal combination of well-maintained living spaces and proactive management, believing it to be a rare find in Bellingham.</p><pThe management style stands out as a highlight in reviews, as the landlord often goes above and beyond in ensuring tenants\u2019 compatibility with roommates and addressing issues like parking and noise complaints. Reviewers described the landlord as friendly, communicative, and professional, which significantly enhances the overall rental experience.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the numerous positive reviews, some tenants have reported significant concerns regarding miscommunication and noise disturbances. A user voiced frustration about what they perceived as constant miscommunication from the landlords, indicating that this has led to a lack of trust and dissatisfaction with the rental experience. Such issues could hinder the otherwise positive reputation of the property and impact tenant retention.</p><p>Another vital concern raised was regarding construction noise that some tenants found disruptive. A user mentioned the noise from construction activities that occurred daily, making it difficult to enjoy their living space. This feedback highlights that while the apartments may offer a great living environment, external factors, such as noise from ongoing work, can detract from the overall experience.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Unfortunately, the Ridge Apartments are not without their serious complaints, as some users have rated the property poorly due to their negative experiences. One user explicitly warned others not to rent from the apartments due to perceived exploitation of tenants and a lack of proper communication from management. Such comments can be damaging, especially when repeated issues are highlighted by multiple individuals.</p><p>Additionally, the frustrations surrounding construction noise and the management approach suggest that while some tenants are satisfied, there may be significant discrepancies in experience across the board. The poor reviews certainly prompt potential renters to consider carefully whether the Ridge Apartments meet their expectations for a peaceful living situation.</p></section>"
