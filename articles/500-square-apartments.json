        "review": "500 square is a nice place to live and is in a great location. I have a slight problem with that when me and my roommates moved in, there was a lot of damages to the apartment that wasnt taken care of prior to our move in. One of the biggest damages was a dent on one of the bathroom doors. We could also see that someone tried to do a paint match but it didnt work out so great and there is multiple dents and scratched to the walls. Another issue is that its hard to get contact with the onsite manager during their said business hours. Besides that, 500 square is an ideal place to live.",

        "review": "The parking lot is very crowded and not very safe. The apartment is on a steep hill and the property management decided to block off the safest and most convenient exit/entrance for the parking lot. To the best of my knowledge it was only to block non-residents from driving in the parking lot. I never noticed a problem with that before, this is my second year living at 500 Square. It has only made the access to parking more difficult and dangerous.",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Thank you for the feedback, Bella. Im sorry to hear that you have had difficulty with the parking lot here. Our goal is to always provide as much parking as possible for our residents in our reserved parking lot and make sure that only residents are utilizing their parking spaces. If you have specific concerns we are more than happy to address them with you when you get a chance to call or talk in our onsite office. "

        "review": "I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately its just not what it claims to be. The building itself is pretty nice, you can tell it was made to look good but not actually be of good quality but I can get over that. My main issue I have here is the lack of management presence and the lack of security/safety. There is almost never a manager on sight, even during 11am-2pm when they are said to be here. There is an entrance/exit that anyone can use to get into the building by sliding your hand through the bars, making it super easy for anyone to enter the apartment building without being a tenant or a guest. I messaged the manager about this 5 days ago and never got a response. I also sent a follow up message yesterday and still no response. I have friends living in this apartment, and when they moved in they didnt even have a functioning dish washer because it was missing key pieces. They didnt have any mirrors in the bathroom either. Yet, they were still paying full price of the rent regardless of not having a fully equipped apartment. When I moved into my unit, there weee already scuffs and dings - specifically around the kitchen. Not to mention there was sawdust in the cupboards. The apartment units themselves are beautiful in my opinion but lack functionality. For example, there is only one drawer in the kitchen in my unit (which is a 2-bed 1.5-bath) - and the drawer cant even be opened because the fridge blocks it from opening fully. Similar issue in the bathroom, if the door is open you cannot open the drawers. I think this apartment could be really great with some improvements but it definitely has a way to go.",

          "text": "Hi Sonja,\nThanks for taking the time to give some feed back. I am sorry to hear you are not satisfied with the property. Regarding management, we have an onsite manager who is in the office from 9-1 every day, you are welcome to drop in and discuss any issues you have when you are available. We have not received any message from you about the door, through there are plans to address that issue right away.

        "review": "Disappointed in the management and overall experience living here. There have been many issues with this place from the beginning. To name a few, the move in date was pushed back two days and we were given less than a days notice, the apartment was still covered in sawdust once we were able to move in, the toilets werent working, the dishwasher wasnt fully installed, mirrors werent installed until weeks after moving in, and now we are dealing with not having electricity for the past 72 hours.",

          "text": "Hi Jane, \nI'm sorry to hear about your disappointment with some issues since you moved in. There were some tight construction deadlines, so we apologize if anything was missed by the builders before move in. Your issue with the electricity being out in part of your unit is being scheduled with the electrician and will be addressed right away, as was confirmed earlier today. That you for your patience as we get the electrician out to address the issue. Thank you for your feedback, and please feel free to voice any further concerns to us and we'll do our best to address any remaining issues."

        "review": "Nice apartments but poor management as far as wait times, parking, and construction goes. This place was supposed to be finished in May 2022 and is still not finished. Its a sunny afternoon and I have my window shut because of all the noise they make all the time. My friends in this building didnt have MIRRORS in their bathrooms until this week. They moved into this place in the first week of September. Also the prison gate door is so deafening that some people just dont close it, which is a security issue.",

          "text": "We're sorry to hear this about your experience here. We strive to make our residents happy, and we apologize for the disruptions and noise caused by construction at the property. Our management team has addressed these noise issues with the construction company, and we anticipate less noise from them going forward, especially as the construction on the property is nearing completion.\n\nIn regards to parking, we are aware of the issues you mentioned in your review and are working to improve these issues. In the meantime, if someone is parked in your spot, please contact management with a description of the vehicle, and the license plate number, so we can have the car removed immediately. We thank you for your understanding in regards to this issue as we sort out this issue on the property.\n\nThank you for letting us know about the noise being caused by the closing of the metal gate, and the safety issue its causing. Weve fixed this since being alerted to the issue. If youre still experiencing this issue, or see the gate left open, please contact us as soon as possible, as safety is of the utmost important at our property.\n\nThat is correct about the missing mirrors for some of our tenants, but we have fixed that issue and those tenants all should have mirrors at this point. We issued a rent credit to compensate those tenants for the inconvenience.\n\nThank you for your feedback, and please feel free to voice any further concerns to us and we'll do our best to address any remaining issues."

I have lived here for just over 3 weeks and I have already heard of 2 of my neighbors being robbed because the doors do not use real locks, instead opting for keypads that malfunction half the time you use them.",

Its content reflects a summary of user reviews, and should not be taken as a fully comprehensive report. The company in question is \"500 Square Apartments\". It is intended to offer a balanced view of the property by considering multiple perspectives as expressed in user reviews. The summary captures sentiments and experiences without disclosing identifiable information about the reviewers.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Good</h2>    <p>According to some user reviews, 500 Square Apartments is described as a favorable place to live, characterizing the apartments as nice and the finishes as excellent. Positive reviews highlight the property's good location, modern amenities, and secure entry, underlining an overall feeling of safety and relaxation. Users express appreciation for the beautiful balcony views, spacious apartments, and the responsive nature of the property manager, with maintenance being just an email away.</p>    <p>There are also commendations for a superintendent who is reported to be super nice and communicative, especially when coming to fix issues, providing a heads-up before arrival. The property management company has shown responsiveness by replying to user reviews and addressing concerns, indicating an openness to feedback and a willingness to resolve issues. The service of the repair team has led to positive experiences for some residents, adding to the general approval.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Great</h2>    <p>Residents who have left favorable reviews for 500 Square Apartments place a high value on the modernity and aesthetic appeal of the apartments, with several mentioning the modern finishes and beautiful, functional spaces within the units. User reviews suggest that families and individuals have found peace of mind in the secured entry system and the added bonus of package parcels is appreciated, enhancing the convenience of living at this property. High recommendations from certain users indicate satisfaction with their living experience.</p>    <p>The presence of an onsite manager, albeit a point of contention for some, is perceived as an upside when available, with a reported regular office presence between 9 AM to 1 PM. There\u2019s also mention of the property manager being very responsive to questions and concerns, contributing to a highly recommended living experience for some. These elements reflect well on the management's commitment to tenant satisfaction, at least from the perspective of these positive experiences.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Bad</h2>    <p>Several user reviews raise concerns about the management's ability to maintain the property and provide timely responses. Complaints include damages to apartments that were not addressed before move-in, indicating a possible oversight or neglect in ensuring the property is in peak condition for new tenants. Challenges in contacting the onsite manager during posted business hours have been frustrating for some residents, with instances of emails and calls going unanswered.</p>    <p>Additionally, concerns have been raised about safety features, such as malfunctioning keypad locks leading to security breaches, and a lack of effective management presence on-site to address these concerns quickly. User reviews suggest that some maintenance requests have not been addressed promptly, leading to prolonged inconveniences for the tenants. These experiences hint at possible systemic issues within the property's management approach to maintenance and security.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Ugly</h2>    <p>The uglier aspects of the user reviews point to severe management and construction-related issues such as delays in apartment readiness, missing basic fixtures like mirrors, functionality problems due to poor design, and significant inconveniences such as lack of electricity for extended periods. Some tenants describe the quality of the building's construction as being made to look good aesthetically but lacking in actual quality, which has led to dissatisfaction with the standard of the apartments and a sense that the advertised features do not match reality.</p>    <p>There are also reports of serious safety concerns, like entrances that allow for easy unauthorized access, and even mentions of robberies due to malfunctioning or inadequate locks on doors. The parking situation has been described as crowded, unsafe, and mismanaged, with non-residents apparently using parking spots without consequence. These points are particularly concerning and appear to suggest more than just isolated incidents, but rather indicative of broader management challenges that could significantly affect the quality of life for tenants.</p>  </section></article>"
