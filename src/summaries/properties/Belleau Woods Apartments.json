      "review": "Worst experience of my life living here. Neighbors rude claiming my dog was barking all day. Had to get a camera to prove he wasn't. They also charge you for noise complaints with no evidence. My car was stolen from the garage they have no cameras or any kind of security.Constant break ins into cars. And I have heard they changed management but when I lived there the manager was one of the rudest most Condescending people I have ever met in my life. The new management seems nicer but they just sent me a bill for damages even though it has been more than a year since I moved out. A year! This place is cheap if you absolutely need somewhere to live but I recommend looking elsewhere at all costs.",

      "review": "I'd like to start by saying...never live here ever. The staff is dumb and loses your rent money and causes you of never paying even though I had copies of my checks from my bank made. They sent me 3 day notice to vacate even though I paid BEFORE it was due. I told them I already paid and they said multiple times they had it taken care of but for some reason I was still getting vacate letters, emails and late charges on my portal. They don't have parking, there's rats everywhere, rude staff, don't give you notice for anything and just enter your apartment while not there and left it UNLOCKED so I come home thinking someone broke in. They look through your packages, \"lose\" your packages, mail missing, water leaks, construction 24/7, said water was included in rent but it's not and also they run the sprinklers all night and charge you because it's \"shared water\". They don't give a crap about anyone here or keeping the place clean and safe. I would give 0 star rating if I could. I also have asthma and the construction mixed with every person including the workers here smoking so I can't open my windows even though it's 85 degrees out. Also your car will get broken into, drawn on, scratched, hit, etc. no cameras, no security, and they don't care. They want money and will do anything to get/steal it.",

      "review": "All of the negative reviews are true. The disrepair, rats, crime are all frequent issues. This place has not been maintained in years and its very apparent. My husband has severe asthma and we have been waiting for a year for them to remedy water damage and mold from old broken windows. Rents go up nearly 100 dollars every lease renewal. They lose your money and then charge late fees. Repairs often consist of telling you nothing is wrong, or stealing random possessions to fix things. When our refrigerator stopped working, it took them 3 days to bring another one (straight out of the junkyard). Walls are so thin that you can hear every conversation from all your neighbors, hope you like rap music at 2 am. Besides the structural issues (which are plentiful), the crime is outrageous as well. There is no security in place, frequent car break ins, and overdoses and other unsafe situations from people wandering in off the streets. There is now a Facebook page dedicated to petitioning for security, since management would have to spend money to make this place safer for their residents, and fixing things is not their bag. Multiple professionals have said this place should be condemned, and they're not wrong. Since speaking out I have faced retaliation from management sending erroneous threatening letters with bogus claims about our tenancy. Please for your own sanity stay far far away from this place, and if you live here and have been wronged, please speak up!!",

  "summary": "# Belleau Woods Apartments: A Candid Review\n\nThis article presents a summary of user reviews for Belleau Woods Apartments, offering a comprehensive view of the sentiments expressed by residents. As an analysis tool, this article is intended to assist individuals in evaluating the property and the management company, with insights built upon the feedback provided by past and current tenants. It is important to note that the information presented here is generated by ChatGPT and aims to provide a balanced overview of the experiences shared in user reviews.\n\n## The Good\n\nFinding a bright spot in the Belleau Woods Apartments reviews is challenging since residents have expressed significant dissatisfaction, leading to an average rating of 1.0. Reviewers consistently reported a lack of positive experiences, making it difficult to highlight the good aspects of living in the complex. It appears that the apartments may offer basic shelter for those who have nowhere else to turn or are in need of immediate and affordable housing. For some, the presence of newer management offered a glimmer of hope, suggesting a possibility for improvements.\n\nDespite the predominantly negative outlook, there seems to be a shared sentiment among a few residents that the recent changes in management might lead to potential improvements in the future. However, any positive impact of these changes remains to be seen, as the bulk of the reviews are entrenched in dissatisfaction. As of the knowledge cutoff, there were no specific instances provided by users to reflect successes or laudable actions taken by the new management team.\n\n## The Great\n\nIt is clear that, according to user reviews, the Belleau Woods Apartments is in dire need of praise-worthy features. When searching for the 'great' aspects cited by tenants, one might struggle as there are no reports detailing exceptional service or facilities that exceed expectations. There is an overwhelming consensus among reviewers that the apartments do not provide an environment that could be deemed 'great' by common standards.\n\nIn the spirit of balance, one could consider that the potential for transformation exists, given that new management is in place. While current reviews do not celebrate any significant improvements, it is possible that future tenants might experience positive changes if the management implements much-needed reforms. Until such reviews become available, the 'great' qualities of this property remain speculative and based on potential rather than realized experiences.\n\n## The Bad\n\nThe user reviews for Belleau Woods Apartments reveal a plethora of issues that residents have faced. Many have criticized the management's handling of noise complaints, stating that fines were imposed without adequate proof. Incidents of crime, particularly vehicle theft and break-ins, have been a major source of concern with users highlighting the lack of security measures such as cameras. Additionally, tenants have reported that even after the reported management transition, billing issues persist, where one user received a bill for damages a year after moving out.\n\nChallenges extend beyond security to include problems with integrity and competence of the staff. Reviewers have alleged mishandling of rent payments, unsolicited apartment entry, misplaced mail and packages, and negligence in issuing notices. The disorganization and unprofessional behavior of the staff have caused frustration and distress among the tenants, leading to an environment that feels both unsafe and unwelcoming.\n\n## The Ugly\n\nThe array of critical issues facing Belleau Woods Apartments deepens with user reports of health hazards, like rats and water leaks, which suggest a serious lack of maintenance. One user mentioned long-standing water damage and mold, alongside insufficient responses to repair requests. Residents are also faced with constant construction and a disregard for those suffering from issues such as asthma, exacerbated by smoke and dust. \n\nIncreases in rent with each lease renewal amid declining living conditions have been met with discontent. Soundproofing seems to be nonexistent, with noise complaints being a common theme across reviews. Users point out a shared sense of helplessness in trying to address the multitude of problems, citing a lack of response from management regarding safety concerns. The reviews culminate in a powerful aversion to the property, with tenants advising others to steer clear and current residents petitioning for basic security measures that have thus far been overlooked by management.\n\nIn summary, while this article strives to maintain a balanced perspective, the overwhelmingly negative feedback provided in user reviews paints a somber picture of life at Belleau Woods Apartments. Potential renters are advised to carefully consider these firsthand accounts when making their decision."
