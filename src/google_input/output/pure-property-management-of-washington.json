If I could give 0 stars I would.\n\nFirst, they let a roommate not pay rent and did't even try to contact the cosigner to make them pay. They could have taken money out of the security deposit but no they made my daughter and her roommates pay for the 4th person when they suddenly moved out. They gave no leniency and just made the people staying in the house figure it out. The person at the front desk (Amber Terry) said \"That's not our problem.\" How unprofessional and Pure was never helpful.\n\nSecond, Rebeka Chadwell let squatters live in the house for 5 months and did not do anything when she was notified. This was very unsafe and these squatters made copies of the house keys and could have given them out to anyone. Anyone could have gotten into the house and that could have been a bad situation.\n\nTLDR: Pure property allows squatters to live in the apartments/houses and offer no help when they are asked.",

We just signed our third lease with them, and though we've only paid rent late once, they were understanding and empathetic during that hard time. They have a very balanced approach to management  they're not overly invasive, but do keep up with the property, always with notice. Their monthly rent is reasonable in the current economic climate (any time I've seen a property on CL, rent with SR has been lower than other similar homes in the area), and they haven't hiked rent on us. They're great at communicating when inspections will be or when anything important comes up, and they've been great about responding to maintenance requests when needed. Son-Rise has been the best property management company I've ever rented with and I'm glad to continue renting with them.",

Taking over from the last company, they have done the impressive task of making Son-Rise a proactive business. Issues ranging from toilet not flushing, constant leaking with freezer and fridge and a washer and dryer who would simply not work. I would not recommend a single person to live in anything with the this company, as it is clear they only care to help when the issue may reflect poorly on them.

I paid rent on time, occasionally a few days late but never had problems with fees. They weren't very good about posting access days during remodeling under the new owner, and occasionally had trouble keeping the washer/dryer running. They did refund me the quarters I lost in the machine though, and even gave me an extra one for the trouble. Delivered right to my door, too. :)\n\nThey were totally on board with a month-to-month arrangement after the lease expired recently, which is great while I search for a job and figure out where I'm moving to.\n\nCan't say too much about them other than that they never bothered me much, but I'm a pretty good tenant, generally. Like most Bellingham managers, there's always someone else to fill the apartment so you don't have a lot of leverage.\n\nHopefully there won't be any issues with the deposit when I leave.",

        "review": "I have had the BEST experience so far with Son-Rise. I had spent hundreds of dollars on applying for apartments through other Property Management companies (even signed a lease and paid a deposit but was taken off of the lease without my knowledge) and was getting very frustrated. I found an adorable little apartment on their web site and contacted them via their web form, not expecting much. I was contacted for a viewing appointment RIGHT AWAY and when I viewed the apartment, was told that I might not make enough money to afford the apartment. Disheartened, I went to their office anyhow to apply. The Property Manager told me that I did make enough and I should apply right away. Much to my surprise and joy, I found out that they ONLY ACCEPT ONE APPLICATION AT A TIME!! So since I had applied, they wouldn't even SHOW the apartment to anyone else!! I was ecstatic. They told me that I wouldn't find out for a week due to the onslaught of applications they had. I needed to move in by the following weekend and was incredibly stressed. But they called me RIGHT AWAY and said that I had gotten the apartment, and I could sign the lease the following business day! I signed the lease, got my keys, easy as that! Now, if that wasn't enough for me to love them--after I moved in, I realized that the lock on the door wasn't enough for me to feel secure. (Just a deadbolt, no other locking mechanism). I emailed my property manager and she had a chain lock installed THE NEXT DAY. On top of THAT, the vertical slatted blinds were old and falling down when I moved in. I didn't notice until the week after, when two of them broke off. I put in a maintenance request through their web site on Thursday, not expecting them to care or fix it. I was planning on fixing them myself after the weekend if I didn't hear from them. The office called me on Friday and said that they would take a look and fix it as soon as possible, but they had so many requests in that it probably wouldn't be for two weeks. I told her that sooner rather than later would be amazing because people could see into my apartment, and she said she would do her best. I went away for the weekend and came home on Sunday to find the ENTIRE thing replaced!!! Needless to say, I have been respected, treated kindly, and overall overjoyed to be renting from Son-Rise.",

We showed up on that day and apparently she didn't write it in and played it off like we never told her the day.  We had all the people ready to help us move and a moving truck already rented and we were told we had to wait the next day.  I had to make it clear that was impossible since everyone worked the next day.  We had to wait for the lease to be prepared and someone to inspect the apartment.\n\nAnytime I had to speak to her on the phone, she was beyond disrespectful over simple questions and gave me incorrect information constantly.\n\nI do not understand how she wasn't fired for the first problem.

When I needed to rent this property I contacted Son-Rise on the advise of a friend, and I couldn't be more satisfied. When I first listed it, the owner (Joan), came to the house with me and advised me on improvements to make (fresh paint, carpet, etc.).  It rented in a timely fashion even though the market was not great, and I got a fabulous tenant who has been there ever since.  During this time every issue that either I or my tenant had was addressed very promptly. I have been advised of every repair needed, but they handle it all.  I would heartily recommend them to anyone, and will use them again if I have any more rentals.",

This company is by far one of the most sued property management companies in the county. They rip off their tenants with high prices, lack of intent to fix basic living necessities that arise in units, coverup piss units by peeling back the carpet and painting under the corners instead of removing the carpets and the list goes on. They treat their vendors who do work on the units as if they are slaves. I know of one particular lady who has been there a while that might do the company a favor if she moves on.",

There is only one person in the whole office that can do anything associated with our building. If she is unavailable there is noone capable of handling any concern.\n\nI have multiple stories about how completely illogical they are about handling issues. The latest being a lockbox I had attached to the front gate that was suddenly missing one day. I was first told by the Keystone contact that Son-rise knew nothing about it. The next day I was told by the same person that they had previously tried to contact the owners of the boxes, but they weren't sure who some of them belonged to. It's pretty logical that they belonged to owners/tenants in the building. It also seems like it should be pretty easy to send a group email/contact the owners.",

It was a shocking news to me that he got the apt with the same stains, spots and holes on carpets and walls!!!!!!!\nWell done Son-Rise.

Not only that we fixed several broken lights, a broken closet door, a stain on the ceiling and the base board heaters (there where all things that where broken when we moved in) We scrubbed the already clean appartment.\n\nOur deposit was $895 today we recieved $325.\n\nIf a cleaning company is taking 8 hours to clean a 650 sq ft apartment then they need to get some new management and new staff that's just insane.\n\nWe are now happy home owners but would like to share this terrible experience with Son Rise in Bellingham and highly reccomend avoiding them if possible.",

At this time, I am still in the process of working with PURE Property Management and getting things finalized for the place that I will be renting out at the end of the month. At this time, both Rose and Rebeka have been super helpful and a delight to work with. I am impressed with their communication and willingness to work with me as we get everything finalized and processed for the rental property. Rose has been very supportive and informative in my application process and same with Rebeka, and that has been a huge help in making sure all the items get actioned and completed in a timely manner as well as ensuring that my concerns and questions get answered and addressed prior to my partner and I moving in to the property.",
