Problems generally get fixed quickly, and they'll be a respectful and attentive landlord as long as you're an attentive tenant.\n\nThey have a reputation for being strict, but I've always been a respectful tenant, and am treated with the same respect.\n\nThey've never played games with nickel-and-diming security deposits, something many other landlords in Bellingham seem to love to do.",

Truthfully Adams is the second worst (Lakeway wins first by a landslide- oi vey). This guy...I've never been so abused by a property management company. Know your renters rights, people! DO NOT let Howard Adams bully you!",

        "review": "Absolutely disgusting and disgraceful excuse for a Property Management company.\n\nMy roommates and I were in love with our duplex we were renting from Adams, until we noticed a few of the appliances (along with the already-damaged carpets and floors that needed maintenance in terms of cleaning) needed attention. Since Adams is... SHOCKER... supposed to facilitate maintenance on up-keeping the house, we have made arrangements for some of these things to be fixed on numerous occasions (and arrangements were NOT made easily by any measure - we always had to be the ones calling the repair people [which i'm pretty sure is not standard procedure]). Finally, one day when my roommate decided to take the rent check in, she inquired about the possibility of having the carpets taken care of, since we had been ignore several times on this request. Without hesitation, the owner (Howard) flipped out on my roommate and spewed the most distasteful sexist garbage onto her, claiming she was a \"bitch\" and threatened eviction on us for no good reason whatsoever, other than the fact that we were \"annoying\" and he \"hated our unit\". (All VERBATIM from what was said) Long story short, APM will not be going down without a fight. Absolutely the worst rental company experience ever.",

        "review": "Renting with Adam's for six years was one of the worst decisions of my life. The homes are not clean -- we moved into a house filled with garbage, food that was YEARS old, and damage -- and ended up having to pay for the previous tenants damage. Howard and the other woman in charge do not have any idea of how to run a business. They are aggressive, disorganized, unprofessional and downright ridiculous. Howard will come to your house unannounced and be rude. Yes, he will just walk in. I wish I was kidding. Don't expect to ever get a call back unless  they didn't get their money. Howard is incredibly aggressive towards women and will cuss at you over the phone or in person. The office is dirty and covered with papers. I have no idea how they get anything done because when they arent being incredibly rude they are so out of it it's comical. Without a doubt the worst experience i've ever had.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In the \"Good\" section of this article's analysis of Adams Property Management, some tenants have appreciated their no-nonsense approach to property management. Tenants who prefer a hands-off landlord found Adams to be satisfactory, citing a comfort with handling their own maintenance and repairs, and appreciation for the autonomy that Adams allowed in doing so. Additionally, there\u2019s recognition of their reasonable pricing, hinting that tenants feel they're receiving fair value for their rentals.</p><p>Furthermore, positive user reviews reflect a sentiment that problems, when they do occur, tend to be addressed in a timely manner. Tenants expressed contentment with quick fixes to issues and a respectful engagement from the property management as long as the tenants themselves maintained their responsibilities. Such experiences indicate that some tenants have had amicable and professional relationships with Adams Property Management over the years.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>The company also seems to excel in certain areas according to user reviews. There are mentions of Adams Property Management's representatives being punctual in dealing with issues, which is a crucial attribute for any tenant dealing with property-related problems. Additionally, for landlords, Adams has been praised for their thoroughness in screening tenants and their overall reliability in property management tasks.</p><p>High marks come, too, from those noting that the management company exhibits integrity and honesty, and maintains excellent communication. This is particularly valued by property owners who rely on Adams to manage interactions with tenants and to follow through on both routine and special requests, ensuring that governing tasks do not fall by the wayside.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, not all user reviews are favorable. One of the issues mentioned repeatedly is a perceived neglect regarding maintenance concerns. Tenants have reported incidents where they had to take on the responsibility for arranging repairs, which can be a significant inconvenience and not a standard expectation in a tenant-management relationship. Some reviews highlighted difficulties in having carpets and appliances fixed, citing a need to constantly follow up and advocate for these basic maintenance needs.</p><p>Moreover, there have been complaints regarding financial dealings with the company. From the perspective of a departing tenant, Adams Property Management is depicted as rigid, potentially retaining last month\u2019s rent despite early vacancy of the premises and threatening legal action without considering the quality or duration of the tenant's residency, which can be viewed as an inflexible and harsh approach to lease agreements.</p></section><section><h3>Ugly</h3><p>Among the most severe criticisms found in user reviews are allegations of unprofessional conduct by Adams Property Management. Instances of aggressive and disrespectful behavior towards tenants, particularly women, have been cited, undercutting the essential reliance on civility and trust in a landlord-tenant relationship. Tenants have reported extreme encounters involving verbal harassment and unannounced, intrusive visits, which could lead to an uncomfortable and hostile living environment.</p><p>The office conditions and organizational skills of the company have been called into question as well, with one long-term tenant describing their rental experience as extremely negative due to the disarray and lack of professionalism encountered. Claims of an untidy office, misplaced paperwork, and delayed responses compound the negative narrative, painting a picture of a property management company that struggles with the fundamentals of business operations and customer service.</p></section>"
