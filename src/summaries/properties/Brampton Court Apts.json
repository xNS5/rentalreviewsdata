      "review": "Way overpriced. There are 2 websites, bramptoncourts.com which is NOT current, and brampton-courts.com which has the current, much higher pricing. 1bed listed on old site is $785, $1025 on new site. These are in no way $1000 apartments. I first stopped by to look at a 1 bedroom and just laughed out loud. It was ok in regards to space and had decent natural light, but it REEKED of smoke even though this is supposed to be a no smoking complex. Also, several of the lights (which are those long industrial bulbs) were out or going out. This was supposed to be move-in ready! Just not at all a $1k apartment. I stopped by one more time to look at what she told me was a different unit. (She didn't realize it was the same one.) They had replaced the carpet and the smoke smell was gone, but it still just wasn't a $1k apartment. No way. I found one at The Edge which actually is one.",

      "review": "All the negative reviews are from quite awhile ago. My wife and I moved in here in September of 2016 and have had quite a wonderful experience, in fact we just signed a new year lease! \n\nWhen we were looking for apartments, I was initially turned off because of all the yelp reviews, I decided to take a look at the place later on because finding housing is tough around here! \n\nThe rates were great on the site and they allowed pets, but we were looking at the old site. Apparently the old owners own www.bramptoncourt.com but the actual site is www.brampton-court.com \n\nParking can be quite difficult at times as parking permits aren't really enforced, but you can always find a spot (depending on how much you want to walk),some parking spaces can be extremely tight (I recommend going for the bigger ones)\n\nThe noise level is not that bad at all! It all depends on your neighbors, which is true with any complex you live in. \n\nMaintenence is always quick to solve our issues and despite there being no fencing or controlled access, it is a very safe place to live. \n\nSince living there, I've had no break ins or attempted break ins, no stolen packages, and no feeling of being creeped on (besides my inlaws showing up unannounced)\n\nAnyways...... Past reviews don't reflect how it is now :)",

      "review": "After moving into Brampton court my apartment was invaded with ants. Talked to management about the problem and they gave me some ant bait boxes that did not work. I spoke to management a second time and they gave me more bait boxes and said there was nothing else they could do. The second round did not help either. I put up with the ant problem the entire 5 months I was at their location and they just had the oh well attitude and did nothing to remedy the situation. I had a cat and probably threw away about $30.00 worth of cat food due to the ants. I never was more glad to be out of a place. I also spent time cleaning and was charged for little things like dust on the side of a cabinet. I definitely would not recommend this apartment complex.",

And you can kiss your $500 deposit goodbye when moving out.\n\nThey will take advantage of college students and Coast Guard people due to the temporary housing needs. \n\nDishonest and bait and switch business. Avoid!",

      "review": "My daughter moved in here and has been lied to, bullied by management, and has not had a full night sleep since moving in. She discussed a 6 month lease and was presented with a full year when she went in to sign the paperwork. Since College had already started she signed without consulting anyone, not knowing that type of bait and switch is a huge red flag regarding future interactions.\nThe few times I have tried to visit and spend the night the neighbors are up all night and making a huge amount of noise, the downstairs neighbor is a drinker and smokes like a chimney, the smoke blows directly into my daughters apartment if she even opens her slider door one little crack. The manager Amanda, is the worst person I have ever had the misfortune to encounter, she is the one that lied about the lease and had my daughter sign something doubling the time. Please be warned, we learned the hard way and am now seeking a lawyer to fight this shady place. Look for somewhere nice, and please ask about management before you move in any where, that's where the problem lies here!!!\n\nUpdate: After dealing with ants, extremely noisy neighbors, numerous phone calls to the police, fights in the parking lot at 3am,  and the apartment managers doing nothing about it, we finally moved my daughter out. BEWARE!!! They are now saying they have purchased from the old owners and no deposits have been transferred over to them. They have $1,000 of our money unaccounted for and won't provide any information. We also were told to not clean the apartment too much as they were going to go in and gut it,  Then we were told they had to spend 2 hours cleaning the kitchen! I cleaned that myself, not my daughter and it was cleaner than when she moved in! Now they say they aren't giving our cleaning deposit back, so there is another $350!!!!! Anyway, telling us they don't have our deposit is illegal, we have spoken with an attorney \n and she told us this is totally illegal, and are looking to begin a class action lawsuit. We welcome anyone else having issues with this apartment complex to contact us. We will be posting on Facebook, Twitter plus handing out flyers and posting in the parking lot of the complex. Strength in numbers people, illegal and shady apartments cannot be allowed to continue behaving like this with no consequences.",

      "review": "Do Not Rent here. The service is Terrible. When signed our lease we were lied to about being able to sign over our lease to someone else if need be. The Property manager said it was completely okay to do and that it \"happens all the time cause this is a college town\". \n\nWell now that we are trying to sign it over, Jeannie from the Corporate Office, said that we are not allowed to do it. This is AFTER she was okay with it. Originally everything was okay because we had a State of Washington employee ready to take over our lease, then he backed out. Now we have some college kids from California who are ready to take over and now its a problem. Seems like discrimination to me. \n\nI'll never do business with Coast Management ever again.",

  "summary": "# Brampton Court Apts: A Comprehensive Review\n\nThis article aims to present a balanced perspective on Brampton Court Apts, drawing insights from user reviews. It is essential to note that the content below is generated by ChatGPT and should serve as a tool to assist in finding a suitable property management company or rental property. The sections below outline the good, great, bad, and ugly aspects of the property as reflected in the reviews.\n\n## Good\n\nBrampton Court Apts received some positive feedback, particularly from a long-term resident who found the experience satisfying enough to renew their lease. They highlighted effective maintenance responsiveness and described the community as safe, with no break-ins or package thefts reported. The noise level was described as manageable, depending mainly on the behavior of the neighbors, a factor which can fluctuate in any living environment.\n\nThe same review mentioned that parking, while sometimes challenging, was navigable with no instances where spots were entirely unavailable. The user appreciated that pets were allowed on the property. This indicates that, for some residents, the basics of a safe and functional living space were indeed met. The sentiment suggests that at certain times and for some tenants, the apartment complex delivered a decent standard of accommodation.\n\n## Great\n\nThere isn't much content that falls under the 'great' category for Brampton Court Apts. The absence of significant praise from reviewers suggests that while some tenants manage to find contentment, the outstanding positives that elevate a property to 'great' status are notably missing. No instances were cited where the property managers went above and beyond, suggesting that 'great' moments, if any, were not impactful enough to be highlighted in user reviews.\n\nDespite the lack of rave reviews, it is worth noting that user experiences may vary significantly, and while current reviews lean towards the negative, future improvements or changes in management practices could lead to enhanced living experiences for future tenants. It is always possible that unreported instances of exceptional service or living conditions have occurred but have not been shared in the reviews accessed for this article.\n\n## Bad\n\nRegrettably, most reviewers shared negative experiences, with multiple complaints about the property management's practices. A common theme was the discrepancy between advertised rental rates and the actual prices presented in leases, signaling potential misrepresentations that led to frustration and a sentiment of being misled. This issue was repeatedly raised by tenants, indicating a systematic problem rather than isolated incidents.\n\nAnother significant grievance was the frequency of management changes, which can lead to inconsistencies in the quality of service and policies. For example, one resident faced an unbearable living environment due to non-opening windows and lack of air conditioning, resulting in high power bills. Moreover, although the complex claimed to be non-smoking, tenants reported the pervasive smell of smoke. Notably, there were allegations of \"bait and switch\" business tactics, particularly with lease terms, which left some residents feeling taken advantage of.\n\n## Ugly\n\nThe 'ugly' aspects of Brampton Court Apts are the most troubling, encompassing severe issues with management and living conditions. There were reports of overt pest infestations, with one tenant citing an ant problem that was not properly addressed despite repeated requests for help. Mismanagement of security deposits also stands out, with one user claiming their deposit was essentially unreturned without valid justification.\n\nSeveral residents felt victimized by dishonest practices, such as altering lease terms without proper communication. One particularly distressing account alleges bullying by management, disruptive noise levels, and safety concerns that went unresolved. A consistent thread in these reviews is the property management\u2019s lack of responsiveness and accountability, suggesting a neglect of duty and a fundamental breakdown in tenant-management relations.\n\n*This article reflects user reviews up to the cut-off knowledge date in early 2023 and does not include any responses from property management to the critiques mentioned above. Future tenants are encouraged to conduct thorough research and consider recent reviews for the most current assessment of Brampton Court Apts.*"
