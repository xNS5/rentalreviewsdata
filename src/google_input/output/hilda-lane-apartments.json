        "review": "Nothing against apex, but the owner is a HORRIBLE person. Harassing tenants to the point we had to put cameras in the apartment scared he was gonna come in while no one was home. Also, the house is so cheaply made its already falling apart. Maplewood is a sketchy ass street, theres absolutely no parking and the place is way overpriced. We moved (thank goodness) less than a mile away to a place $400 cheaper and 400x better.",

The owner harrassed me about it, telling me that he didn't think I really needed it, didn't need me \"parading it around\" when I took her on a walk, and wanted me \"to stay in the corner where you live\".\nParking is also a joke, as nobody at APEX seems to take parking seriously. They let cars park there with no permits with no punishments, occassionally making the RESIDENTS park off-street.\nWish I was able to rate lower.",
