      "review": "THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! DO NOT MOVE HERE I BEG YOU!\nThis place is an absolute nightmare, and was before we moved in, and continues to be.\nI couldn't scratch the surface of how bad this place was, but to give you context it was about $800 a month per person, and we lived there for about a year. \n\n-AWFUL communication from the multiple people who owned the property (I think there were 3 companies that owned in in less than a year). The emergency line (on multiple occasions) went unanswered, they just really don't care.\n\n-The apartments themselves SUCK. Not only are they small, but the design makes no sense. We had no living room/living space, and had no openable windows in the main area.\n\n-There is no upkeep to the property. This place is the definition of \"don't fix it, paint over it\". In the winter, there was a broken waterpipe that made accessing the parking lot dangerous -they didn't fix it for weeks.\n\n-No one who works there has any clue what they're doing (expect for Carl and Niko, who are awesome). Probably due to the management constantly changing, no one is ever able to give you a straight answer on anything -that is if you can even reach them. You call, you email, you can visit the office. Most of the time, they will not answer your calls (even if you leave a message), and are almost never at the office during office hours. \n\n-My roommates and I were tricked and lied to when it came to our lease. When we signed the lease, we were signing a lease for 5 bedrooms. AFTER we signed the lease, they told us no 5 bedroom apartments were available, so we ended up having to split up. We were totally tricked/trapped.\n\n-The security deposit was $200. After emailing and calling SEVERAL people, I finally got my deposit back about a month after moving out. When I got it, they had taken out $85 for maintenance and cleaning. WHAT?? Not only was the apartment FILTHY when we arrived, we also deep cleaned it before leaving. There was absolutely no damage, so there is no reason that money should've been taken out.\n\n-For weeks in the Winter, and Spring the fire alarms would go off for minutes at a time. Everyone would have to pack up themselves and their pets to move out into the parking -only for the fire department to tell us that there was no fire, but faulty equipment. THIS HAPPENED PROBABLY 10 TIMES ALTOGETHER. \n\n-Consistently bad wifi, no place to set up cable or internet in the main area\n\n-No circulation (food goes bad pretty fast)\n\n-Laundry cost $4 a load. The machines are disgusting and never get cleaned, same with the dryers that usually don't dry your stuff properly. It's ridiculous we have to pay at all.\n\n-Of course, rent is expensive everywhere, but to have the audacity to charge so much money for such an HORRENDOUS place to live is criminal.\n\nPlease don't move here, I promise you'll regret it.",

      "review": "It's unfortunate that I have to give this place a star. Don't live here. The \"friendly\" office staff is fake as fuck and couldn't be less helpful. My apartment was not cleaned whatsoever at the time of move in. Their deposit system is trash. Worst of all is parking. You either pay 25 dollars a month on top of rent which is already too high or most days there is nowhere to park. The wifi is too expensive and fucking trash and incredibly slow. Live anywhere else. NXNW is 100 more per month but better in virtually every way. You will save the extra money you are spending at NXNW solely by the fact that WIFI is included there and that laundry is free there. Laundry at this complex is 3.5 dollars per wash. \n\nAlso, my bathroom floor was dilapidated and had black mold growing over the place at the time of move in. They took several days to get it fixed. My biggest regret is not suing them and calling the health department when this happened. Don't live here.",

  "summary": "# Viking Gardens Apartments - An In-Depth Review\n\nIn this article, we take a closer look at Viking Gardens Apartments, analyzing various user reviews to create a well-balanced perspective on the establishment. It's important to note that the reviews considered for this article are generated by ChatGPT and serve as a tool for individuals seeking a property management company or rental property.\n\n## Good\n\nViking Gardens Apartments seems to have a potentially good side, with some tenants expressing satisfaction with staff interactions. One user review mentioned a positive move-in process and excellent service, suggesting that the initial experience can be pleasant and staff can be accommodating. Other user reviews highlighted the friendliness and diligence of the office staff, possibly making the living experience more comfortable for some residents.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the maintenance team was noted to be responsive and helpful. This indicates that when issues did arise, there were instances where the problems were addressed in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, some tenants have not reported major complaints and seem generally content with the level of service provided.\n\n## Great\n\nSome user reviews for Viking Gardens Apartments showed an even greater level of satisfaction with specific aspects of the service. Comments such as 'super friendly staff' and 'very easy service' shine a positive light on the customer service experience. It seems that for some residents, the staff's approachability and willingness to assist left a lasting, positive impression.\n\nWhen looking at the communication aspect, a handful of reviews praised how easy it was to converse with the management. This ease of interaction can often lead to a more trusting and comfortable relationship between management and tenants, potentially enhancing the overall living experience at Viking Gardens Apartments.\n\n## Bad\n\nHowever, not all feedback about Viking Gardens Apartments is positive. Several user reviews cited serious concerns about the property's living conditions and management practices. Some reviews described the apartments as being small, with nonsensical design and lacking in necessary amenities such as openable windows. Issues such as expensive laundry facilities that are ill-maintained and consistently poor wifi only compound these frustrations.\n\nManagement's approach to communication appears problematic, with reviews mentioning awful communication practices and difficulty in getting straight answers to important questions. The frustration is further exacerbated by management's alleged unresponsiveness to urgent issues, such as faulty fire alarms and unaddressed water damage.\n\n## Ugly\n\nThe most distressing aspect of the user reviews is the repeated mention of management behavior that borders on deception. Multiple reviews described being lied to about the conditions of their leases and the state of their accommodations upon move-in. One particular review even suggested that the company engaged in a bait-and-switch tactic regarding the availability of five-bedroom apartments.\n\nMoreover, high rent fees coupled with additional charges for basic amenities like parking and internet have left several tenants feeling exploited. With complaints of general property neglect and poor security, it's clear that some residents believe the value they receive is nowhere near the financial and personal investment they've made into Viking Gardens Apartments.\n\nIn summary, while there are highs and lows in user reviews of Viking Gardens Apartments, prospects should consider the entirety of this article's intent\u2014to provide a comprehensive overview\u2014and weigh the information carefully to make an informed decision regarding their potential future living situation."
