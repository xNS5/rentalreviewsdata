        "review": "Worst experience of my life living here. Neighbors rude claiming my dog was barking all day. Had to get a camera to prove he wasn't. They also charge you for noise complaints with no evidence. My car was stolen from the garage they have no cameras or any kind of security.Constant break ins into cars. And I have heard they changed management but when I lived there the manager was one of the rudest most Condescending people I have ever met in my life. The new management seems nicer but they just sent me a bill for damages even though it has been more than a year since I moved out. A year! This place is cheap if you absolutely need somewhere to live but I recommend looking elsewhere at all costs.",

        "review": "All of the negative reviews are true. The disrepair, rats, crime are all frequent issues. This place has not been maintained in years and its very apparent. My husband has severe asthma and we have been waiting for a year for them to remedy water damage and mold from old broken windows. Rents go up nearly 100 dollars every lease renewal. They lose your money and then charge late fees. Repairs often consist of telling you nothing is wrong, or stealing random possessions to fix things. When our refrigerator stopped working, it took them 3 days to bring another one (straight out of the junkyard). Walls are so thin that you can hear every conversation from all your neighbors, hope you like rap music at 2 am. Besides the structural issues (which are plentiful), the crime is outrageous as well. There is no security in place, frequent car break ins, and overdoses and other unsafe situations from people wandering in off the streets. There is now a Facebook page dedicated to petitioning for security, since management would have to spend money to make this place safer for their residents, and fixing things is not their bag. Multiple professionals have said this place should be condemned, and they're not wrong. Since speaking out I have faced retaliation from management sending erroneous threatening letters with bogus claims about our tenancy. Please for your own sanity stay far far away from this place, and if you live here and have been wronged, please speak up!!",

        "review": "The management here is the worst. High attrition rate amongst office staff. Absolutely the worst human interaction I've ever had. Cars get broken into, tires slashed, not a good area, does not be fooled by appearances. Stay away!!",

        "review": "I'd like to start by saying...never live here ever. The staff is dumb and loses your rent money and causes you of never paying even though I had copies of my checks from my bank made. They sent me 3 day notice to vacate even though I paid BEFORE it was due. I told them I already paid and they said multiple times they had it taken care of but for some reason I was still getting vacate letters, emails and late charges on my portal. They don't have parking, there's rats everywhere, rude staff, don't give you notice for anything and just enter your apartment while not there and left it UNLOCKED so I come home thinking someone broke in. They look through your packages, \"lose\" your packages, mail missing, water leaks, construction 24/7, said water was included in rent but it's not and also they run the sprinklers all night and charge you because it's \"shared water\". They don't give a crap about anyone here or keeping the place clean and safe. I would give 0 star rating if I could. I also have asthma and the construction mixed with every person including the workers here smoking so I can't open my windows even though it's 85 degrees out. Also your car will get broken into, drawn on, scratched, hit, etc. no cameras, no security, and they don't care. They want money and will do anything to get/steal it.",
