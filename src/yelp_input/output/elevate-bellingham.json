        "review": "Please read the following post before renting an apartment at The Elevate.\n\nMy son has lived here for a couple of years now.  Recently, the batteries went dead on the electronic lock on his door so he was unable to lock his door.  He notified the management that he could not secure his apartment (studio) and that he was basically stuck at home there until maintenance could fix his door lock.\n\nThe management sent the maintenance guy down who told him that they could change the batteries out but didn't have the computer program to re-program the locks (computers with program on them stolen evidently) so his apartment would remain unlockable.  This was on a Thursday.  My son went back on Friday.  No resolution, no plan, no repair just lots of excuses to not repair door.  No urgency, no apparent desire to solve the problem before the weekend. Entire weekend then stuck in an unlockable apartment.  My son missed his weekend at work because he could not lock his door and leave and subsequently missed out on a couple hundred dollars of pay.\n\nMonday, same song and dance.  Run around from management.  Calls to regional manager who wouldn't answer phone and apparently would not authorize the placement of a simple mechanical lock on the door. \n\nOn Tuesday I got involved and called asking to talk to the manager.  She was pleasant but said her hands were tied.  I requested to talk to regional manager and got his number.  Based out of Arizona, he would not answer my calls or return my calls.  Several attempts but no contact and zero customer service.  I asked the building manager if they could at least put a standard mechanical lock on the door so he could lock his apartment and attend class. More run around, no resolution.\n\nFinally on Wednesday, we heard they were going to fix the lock sometime between 10am and 2pm.  My son went to class expecting the problem to be resolved.  Came back from class-door lock still broken.\n\nThursday, one week from door lock problem the maintenance guy came back out and put a mechanical door lock on his door which is what should have been done on day one. \n\nSo, what is your time worth?  What value do you put on expecting that your apartment is going to be lockable and secure?  What value do you put on your belongings?  Your computer and personal items?  What does it feel like to be sequestered in your room because the management would not authorize a door lock for your apartment? (a really simple and inexpensive fix)  What kind of obligation do you feel toward your employer and the job that you have?  What dollar value do you think this should impact rent?\n\nPlease remember that Elevate is a private for profit business that recognizes that students are transitory and likely will only live there for a year or two.\nTaking care of their residents does not appear to be a priority in any shape or form.  Please take this into consideration before renting an apartment here.\n\nDoug S",

        "review": "Our daughter moved out in August and has been trying to get her deposit back since then. Don't rent here!!  They don't respond when there's anything broken. They don't respond when you ask for your deposit. Just look at the responses on this page - they only respond to positive reviews. Very sad. I hope all renters get together and take them to court over deposit issues.",

        "review": "For one bedroom in an apartment with 3 other roommates the cost is too high. Most amenities were not available while I lived here, there was no change to rent and the company withdrew their offer for reduced rent with proof of good grades. \nThe staff seems to do their best but were ill-equipped for the maintenance necessary for the building. The only elevator to the non-reserved parking garage is frequently in disrepair including on move-in day, forcing residents to walk up 3-7 flights of stairs to access their apartment (folks with ability impairments too!) \nNeighbors within the building are often inconsiderate in 3 ways: 1) noise penetrates the walls, floor and ceiling so there is potential disruption from any and all directions making studying from home a challenge. 2) messes in the trash room, hallway, parking garage and other common areas are constant. The 6th floor entrance is frequently soaked in dog urine. 3) many residents (and staff) don't follow COVID guidelines regarding large gatherings and wearing masks. \nYes this apartment has conveniences but there are also many drawbacks.",

        "review": "Too expensive, especially considering they never fix anything. There has been a door into the mail room that has been broken for six months and they just haven't bothered to fix it. There was an alarm that was going off for about a week in the basement that I honestly don't know what was for but it wasn't life threatening so idk why they never shut it off. They also stopped sending notifications for when you get packages (which btw is annoying that the hours to pick them up are really limited) at one point without telling anyone they would and my roommate needed her meds but had to go a few days without them since she didn't know they were here... the trash room is always a disaster, the dishwasher is unreliable, and the vibe is like a hotel dorm situation. That being said dorms are usually more maintained. To be fair everyone that worked in the office quit on the same day so I can see why for a while the maintenance was worse than normal but then you have to question why everyone quit. Also the certification for the elevator expired, and it was down for a hot minute so not good for accessibility reasons AT ALL. This complex is located on a street that a ton of party houses are on so I hope you like noise and fireworks at 2am. Also just cars are loud and frequent. The walls are super thin though so everything is loud. \nNow I know covid made things difficult and that's fair, but the amenities were down for the majority of the time and they never did anything to make up for it (such as a refund for amenity fees as an example) \nIf you're thinking about moving to bham, especially as a student, just get a house, it's roughly half the cost per month if you can get some good roommates (and it's easier to avoid them in a house if they are bad so...)\nIt seemed like a good decision when we signed the lease, but that wasn't the case.  Covid did screw some stuff up and it probably would have been better without it and they might have gotten a higher rating from me, but they handled it poorly, it's like they gave up on everything, and they it really hard to get of the lease so I know people that never set foot in here and still paid full price the whole time. \nTLDR; they need to Elevate their standards",

        "review": "My daughter moved out of Elevate August 2021. I co signed on her lease, and they asked for a 2,400 dollar deposit. She was going to move back to Oregon, and needed the deposit for another apt. They said it would get to her soon. We communicated with Veronica in the office weekly for awhile. She was always nice and answered our questions. The weeks turned into months, and still nothing. They would tell her to tell us it in was in the mail. The employees at Elevate were always nice and helpful, but management was not. We decided to take them to court at one year, and just served them papers. We were angry at how management brushed us off, and asked for what we thought was fair. It's the day before court day14 months later, and they agree today. Elevate was   not at fault in this matter and Veronica the office mgr. is a very nice person! It's just too bad we had to go that far just to get our money back.",

Be very aware of what you are signing!\nOur friend's son had to leave school and his apartment to return to Seattle for treatment of cancer.
