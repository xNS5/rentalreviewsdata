We have been lucky enough to be working with Gabby, who quickly processed our applications and was extremely accommodating. She provided consistent communication throughout the entire process and made our transition to Bellingham one of the best experiences that we have had with renting a property. If your looking to move within Bellingham I would highly recommend renting through PCR.",

Gabby is the glue that brings these two things together correctly. She is prompt when I have concerns and communicates in a very direct and understandable way. I enjoy working with her much more than other property managers from different companies over my life time. Keep up the good work Gabby!",

I usually communicate through email & always get a response in a timely manner. The rent is fair & reasonable. They do a great job of solving any issues that arise. I would highly recommend PCR. Ask for Ben, he's really easy to work with.",

She is prompt in responding to requests and urgent needs and always goes above and beyond. Out of all the experiences Ive had with rental companies in Bellingham, PCR has felt the most personal, unlike a lot of those big companies that only value profit. I would recommend Gabby to anyone looking to sign with PCR. She will take care of you!",

        "review": "We turned to PCR a year ago to manage our 50+ unit residential complex. They have transformed the entire property, well beyond expectations. Gabby Marcuzzo, our agent, is efficient, detail-oriented, and unflappably courteous. She's at ease working with tenants, contractors, agencies, and colleagues. She's organized and always ready to offer tenants a good experience backed by good boundaries. Best of all, she works closely with Richard Bonham, head of maintenance and renovation (PCM). Richard manages a sizable team expertly and is so experienced himself it's scary. Under his watch, building issues always get resolved--from ad hoc service calls to multi-phase projects. Both Richard and Gabby are establishing processes to monitor the health of our buildings and manage repairs and renovations in a predictable way. We're grateful that PCR invests in high-quality people for their teams--it's made all the difference for our residential property.",

Throughout this relationship, initially with acquisition of the commercial investment and currently with Gabby providing property management, the focus has been to provide outstanding value to our student tenant population.  Upgrades over the years have included exterior painting, kitchen countertops, cabinets and luxury vinyl flooring to provide our students a very modern, clean and crisp living experience.  With Gabbys leadership we strive to maintain a quality product.",

        "review": "I am writing this review because the company seems to respond more to bad reviews online than they do to emails from their tenants. The unit was advertised to have a dishwasher on multiple rental sites, when we moved in we found out that there would not be a dishwasher and that we would have to pay the same as other units that did include a dishwasher. In addition to that the apartment was very sloppy on move in day. There is paint on almost every window, paint on the bathroom mirror, as well as some painted spots on the floor. There is also hair painted onto the wall in multiple places. The kitchen was disgusting- me and my partner spent hours cleaning it, the cabinets still had things from the previous tenant inside. There was gum on the floor that I had to scrape off. The rental company says they charge the previous tenant for cleaning, but the cleaning was clearly not done in our unit. The screen for the sliding door has multiple holes in it and gets stuck, and the blinds are cracked and damaged. After we told our complaints to the company they only offered a 1 time 100$ prorate on our rent which quiet frankly is not a fair amount for the state our apartment is in. After we contacted both of the supervisors they told us it was not there responsibility. Very unprofessional. Do not recommend this company.",

        "review": "Pacific Continental is super unprofessional, Im really upset we signed a lease with them. I don't even make reviews but I'm stuck with them for a year and they continue to be disrespectful even after complaints. They only care about their status and wallet. Their response to our concerns was ridiculous. After signing the lease, she asked if we could push back a couple days for maintenance, so we asked to be put in a hotel since we really needed the place the day we signed and had paid for already. She then said maintenance will push through and we can move-in the same day. But when we saw the place, there was gum on the floor, kitchen was dirty with last tenants items including a reusable straw, food spills or something leaked inside the fridge, and you can tell everything was rushed and sloppy. Our place also noted to have a dishwasher and were paying the same price as tenants with, but dont have one. Our apartment neighbors also thought they would have a dishwasher due to the misrepresentation- only 2/52 units have a dishwasher but they advertised it on several rental sites (4+) that the units came with it. When they note \"Not all units alike\", you'd expect a different floorplan not a loss in amenities! We're paying the same price as those with a dishwasher! When we talked to the co-owner of PCR, they just pointed fingers at another company, and then pointed more fingers at their maintenance crew rather than taking accountability. They refused to reduce the rent so I asked if they could at least install and still no answer- longest she hasnt responded but was quick to respond that she wont reduce rent. Our current landlord after that one left, has shut off our water multiple times due to construction, without any prior notice. We have gone hours without water. Also, they don't care about the tenants at all and wont make any effort to rectify their wrongdoings and the breaches in the lease they have made. They also did not have enough accessibility, including parking, and just now made more room after expressed concern from another party. Also, our place has unassigned parking but there aren't enough spots for everyone so more than half the days of the week we are forced us to find parking elsewhere, and there are tow zones all around us. There have been multiple complaints about this by many, including myself, but they don't care because they're not the ones living there, they're the ones making money off us living there. They don't care about their tenants and will continue their scamming. Save yourself and don't sign with PCR!",

          "text": "Hi Brandi,\nWe are so sorry to hear that you have had a 1-star experience with us! You are correct that it was a rush to meet the timeline and we are pleased that we were able to meet that expectation. We are in the process of remodeling all the units in your apartment complex and Skye advocated on your behalf to personally make sure that your unit was completed and delivered on time. My understanding is that you were compensated for and issue with the cleaning.\nI believe that there may have been confusion about a dishwasher. Only 2 of the 52 units in your complex that have a dishwasher. We do not market that the units have a dishwasher. One of the photos in our marketing has a dishwasher visible in the photo, however, there is a disclaimer that Photos marketed for this property may not be of the actual unit available.\nSkye has reached out to you with my direct contact information if you have any questions or additional concerns.\nBest\nRyan"
