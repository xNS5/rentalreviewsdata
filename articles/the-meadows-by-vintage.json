The neighborhood is nice. There's trails right behind the apartments. Plenty of places to walk.\n\nThe people who work in the office are nice.\n\nJust as with any apartments you have to deal with certain things. But I don't hear my neighbors and they have said they don't hear me. Which is a blessing because I have 3 kids and live on the 3rd floor :)",

        "review": "We lived at the Meadows apartments for a year before we had to relocate for work.\n\nWe loved our spacious, comfortable and affordable apartment from the first moment we stepped in there and saw the duck pond from the living room door to the balcony.\n\nIt was a delight to be able to watch the view, the seasons change, the sun rise and the wild life at the pond from our porch. We did move in during the winter and it was very quiet. It does get noisier in the summer with the ducks, bull frogs and kids running around, but these are all sounds that I like hearing, so it wasn't an issue for me.\n\nThe one thing that I would change if I could was the insanely long paperwork process we had to go through to rent the apartment. We had no clue what we were getting into and probably wouldn't go through it if we knew, so it's good that we didn't. That's not on the company, it's the state requirements for this type of rental.\n\nFortunately for us, Jim, the office manager, helped us with every needed step. He truly has endless patience and we're super grateful for his professional help and support throughout the whole process and generally the whole time we lived there.\n\nJim also handled every request we had for things that needed to be fixed in the house very quickly and we very much appreciated having Casey, the maintenance man with a huge heart, come over and take care of things, when needed.\n\nAll together we liked the location, the neighborhood, the apartment, the view, the price and the good service we got from Jim and Casey, so I recommend this place to anyone who is willing to go though the lengthy required rental process.",

I put in a maintenance request about a week ago and they haven't even came to look at it or try to fix it. Don't move into these apartments if you want your things to be fixed  without hassle.\n\nUpdate: Its now fixed, things are crazy right now because they are giving the place a face lift.

        "review": "I have lived here for five, almost six years and seen MANY changes. One of the most constant things that I have noticed is the kind, courteous, and professional way that I have been treated over the last several years. Living with a disability can be tough, but the staff here have never failed to treat me with the same kindness, and understanding as I treat them, and I really love that.  The rent here is super low, and the newest landlady, Melissa has been absolutely amazing. Her solid work ethic, big heart, and dedication have really done wonders in improving the place to not just livable, but absolutely high quality, family living. I wake up each and every day, and I know that I am blessed to have not just a lovely apartment, great room mates, and the most wonderful land lady and staff that I could ever ask for \n\nUpdate: I have lived here for ten years now and am now seeing some very big changes. The leases offered are now only 30 days which feels scary and sort of unstable but I may end up liking the auto renew more I'm not sure yet.  Parking is now all paid (you pay to register your car and now also pay additionally if you'd like it covered which is fine) I've recently had alot of experiences that have been really hard for me emotionally but I've chosen to leave them out. What I will tell you is this. Read reviews before moving in. Then make your decision. There are many pros to living here. After ten years this place has felt like my home. The location is PERFECT right on the busline every 30 minutes. Walking distance from Cordata school and whatcom community college, the mall and several stores. The maintenance guy Casey is kind, professional and experienced. I don't really have much else to say so I guess that's my update :)",

        "review": "As mentioned earlier, this place has the makings of a real gang-infested complex. Section 8, SSI, welfare, and other such recipients make up a good chunk of the people here. I could write stories here of what I've seen and heard, but there might be children reading this. The weekend noise is awful, especially the drunks coming in at 2AM. Many parents let their children run loose in the parking lot all day unsupervised. The resulting noise is unreal. This may change in the winter. I'm not going to be here to find out (thank God). Good bye and good riddance! Avoid like plague. I should also mention that I made an appointment to sign the lease at move-in time and was rescheduled (to a later day) half an hour before the arranged time because, I was told, the person who had an appointment before me was late. Not my problem. Also overheard management in confrontations with other staff in front of tenants. Highly unprofessional. If you move here, you will be sorry.",

They billed me $3383 after we moved out!!!!\n\nBefore we moved out, the manager said that we had to pay only until the last day we stayed (which is only 2 days of the new billing circle) then they billed us for the whole month.\n\nThey also billed us for the new carpet replacement of more than $1600 saying that they replaced the carpet before we moved in and after we moved out, which is a lie. Before we moved in we were told to wait for a few days because they just shampooed the carpet. Then after we moved in, the carpet was still wet and it took almost a month till the carpet got dry. I also talked to the new tenant of the apt and he said the carpet was not replaced, they just cleaned it because when he moved in the whole floor was damp.\n\nToday I went there to talk to the manager, she was totally ignorant and rude. She asked me to talk to the credit company that handles my case while she was the one who prepared the bill to cheat my money. She even threatened to call the police on me. Such a horrible place, I so regret that I gave them 2 years of rent.\n\nThe Meadows by Vintage, dishonest business won't get you anywhere! You guys are supposed to help low income people, not to scam them. I hope there will be more people who raise their voices so police will investigate this place.",

Inforcinging new parking policies within the last month I would think as a courtesy (and as a current resident) I would be allowed 2 decals free of charge, (since decals were not required before) I'm just curious cause my household was down a vehicle at the time of new parking policies last month, and now I'm required to purchase a decal, so does this mean all new residents and new vehicles with be charged $50? Is there now a limit to one vehicle per household?",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite some criticism, The Meadows by Vintage has garnered positive remarks for its spacious apartments and pleasant neighborhood, with specific praise towards the nature trails behind the property and the serene views offered by some units, like that overlooking the duck pond. A recurrent theme in the user reviews is the commendable performance of the maintenance team, with Casey being mentioned several times for his efficient and rapid service, leaving residents impressed with the quality of the work completed within their homes.</p><p>Management received applause for their efforts in addressing matters diligently. Field specifics include an instance where maintenance was conducted swiftly for a new toilet installation, with the tenant expressing immense gratitude for the immediate response and exceptional work. A former tenant fondly recollected their time at the property, highlighting the consistently good service received from the staff, particularly Jim and Casey, who provided professional help throughout the rental process and promptly addressed repair requests.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>In terms of community engagement, the property's effort to keep the premises clean has been noticed and appreciated by residents, contributing to a relatively peaceful living experience for a large complex. Moreover, the property management's responsiveness to positive feedback indicates a desire to maintain good relationships with the tenants. The offices have shown appreciation for positive feedback, and there's evidence of improvements being actively made, with the community director reaching out to residents to express gratitude and openness to providing further assistance when needed.</p><parah>User reviews highlight the congeniality and professionalism of the office staff, with a resident emphasizing their positive experience with staff members who exhibit a strong work ethic and big heart. Residents appear to feel welcomed and at home, thanks to the graciousness of the property\u2019s team. This embracing atmosphere, coupled with a favorable location near daily amenities and educational institutions, seems to contribute to a sense of community well-being.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>While there are admirable traits, The Meadows by Vintage is not without its flaws. Residents have voiced complaints about slow maintenance response times, where issues like a malfunctioning kitchen sink were not promptly addressed, resulting in prolonged inconvenience. Additionally, another tenant experienced a delay in the repair of a broken light on their stairs, which posed a safety risk and directly caused personal injury and property damage.</p><p>The leasing process also received criticism for being excessively lengthy and convoluted, despite the help offered by the office staff. A particular problem that stands out is the thirty-day lease offers which, according to a long-time tenant, cause a feeling of instability despite their allegiance to their home of ten years. This, coupled with difficulties in parking policies and apparent changes in management, has led to unease among some residents.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>On a more disconcerting note, some tenants have experienced significant distress regarding management's conduct, with allegations of unprofessional behavior and disputes going unresolved. Cases such as providing a wrong number for supervisor contact and a perceived lack of respect towards residents' concerns are tarnishing the community's image. Furthermore, discriminatory remarks and indications of possible fair housing violations, as noted in a resident's feedback, suggest deeper managerial and ethical issues that may need investigation.</p><p>The most alarming review recounts a former resident being billed exorbitantly upon move-out, contradicting prior assurances about the payment terms. Accusations of deceptive practices, such as false claims of carpet replacement and threats of legal action when concerns were raised, raise serious concerns about the integrity and transparency of the property management. These grievous complaints need immediate attention, both to aid affected individuals and prevent potential exploitation of future or current residents.</p></section>"
