        "review": "Erin and the staff at Roma Management were more than helpful, they were absolutely amazing!\n\nI was looking for a new apartment for my mother on short notice, and Erin and team went above and beyond to find us the right place at the right price, and helped us every step of the way. The new place is fantastic and my mother couldn't be happier. Erin was right, it was perfect for her.\n\nDespite the short notice combined with the twists and turns that go with getting in to a new place, Erin was always polite, cheerful, and thoroughly professional.\n\n10/10 - Would have my own mother rent here",

        "review": "Pros:\n- Office management is very caring and professional, always willing to help with anything you need\n- Hardly raised the rent at all during my time here ($25 total raise for two years)\n- Easy to use portal for rent payments and maintenance requests\n- Very comfy & cozy with nice appliances, great insulation in the building\n\nCons:\n- Horrible parking. The customers from the massage parlor, delivery people, and tenant's guests constantly take reserved spaces. While the office staff tries very hard to help, sometimes the office is closed and nothing can really be done besides parking in the overflow parking lot which is further away. Not very fun when it's cold/rainy out\n- Slow maintenance. They are always very kind and always get it done but it takes awhile\n\nOverall I've enjoyed my stay here, I'm moving due to other circumstances but if I was looking to continue living in a studio apartment I'd stay",

Regrettably parking allocation is out of our control, we do inform all our prospective tenants prior to renting about the challenges. Our goal is to ensure maintenance items are completed in a timely manner however some items do take longer. The Property mangement does need to owner to approve maintenance."

Usually things were just ignored or brushed off and I ended up having to do a lot of repairing around my super old house myself. Since Roma took over Ive felt like Im actually being taken care of again and its a breath of fresh air. By far the most attentive and generally best property management company Ive rented through since I started renting years and years ago. From day 1 theyve been super caring and on top of things. Thanks for all you guys do!!",

With the housing market the way it is right now not everybody cares about the renters so much, well this is not the case of Roma Management, they were all very supportive and listening specially Erin, we moved from a different state and we were not able to see the apartment in person before we moved in but Erin made us feel confident that we were going in the right direction, guided us through the whole process without running into any issues.\n\nSame thing happened when we moved out, everything was super clear and done efficiently. We moved before our lease finished and Erin helped us to get someone in as soon as possible!\n\n100% recommend ",

She worked with me for our special move in circumstance, and considered both my needs and the needs of the owner until we came up with a solution, which shows she is both an excellent employee and a genuinely caring person. She was also INCREDIBLY fast in the approval process which made everything so much less stressful. Emma also showed me our unit, and she was really nice and super helpful. The company as a whole has been super upfront with what the need/expect, and none of their requests have been obscene or unwarranted. The listings are extraordinarily accurate to the units, which has not been the case with many property management companies in Bellingham. Definitely my best experience with rental companies so far!

I have tried to apply to a couple of different properties in Bellingham and had to always chase them down to get a reply.  I spoke with Erin after the office was already closed for the day and she spoke to me for an hour before I even applied.  Later that evening, I applied for the apartment and received approval in less than 24 hours.  This tells me a few things about Erin and ROMA Management:\n1) They understand how stressful looking for an apartment is and try their best to make it as pain free as possible.\n2) They listen to what your needs are and do their best to accommodate.\n3) They are here for the tenants and property owners; looking to find the best fit for both.\n\nThank you Erin and ROMA Management for putting your clients first; tenants and owners.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you in August.",

I didn't like that they kept my $1250 deposit when I moved out early though. There were no damages at all in my unit, but they apparently keep the whole deposit if you don't stay the whole lease. Other PM companies like Landmark don't charge that high of a fee to break a lease, especially considering they now can rent my spot for a few hundred dollars more per month just because I left early. If anything, I did them a favor lol. But oh well, it was a nice apartment at least.",

The garbage area was always a disgusting mess and they would just let it overflow till someone decided to complain. The office management is never in office during their regularly scheduled hours and they are completely clueless most of the time.\n\nI advise not to rent here.

Our unit was spacious and modern and close to I-5 and shopping. I will say, there seemed to be poor installation and winters were rough here. During storms, I've also been locked out of the building. I always felt taken care of by management, but was a bit shocked by the huge rent increase during my first few months living there. By the time I left, rent increased nearly $400! Maintenance was slow and difficult to reach, parking was totally a disaster, but I think they were more than accommodating with frequent roommate changes than I would have expected, considering the building was mostly made up of quiet family types. Now that I'm starting my own family, I'd like nothing more than to move back into these apartments- however the rent is getting a little steep (I'm currently renting a 2 bd in Seattle for about $1300, it's tiny but it's affordable and close to everything). If I ever move back to Bellingham, I would definitely look at Roma properties first.",

She stayed in touch during the approval process so we weren't in the dark (again, rare) and all paperwork arrived on time as promised.  Erin is a great rep for Roma and a solid professional.",

        "review": "Haven't gotten to our maintenance request for 3 months now. Almost 4. Accusing us of not nofiying them of our pet rabbit. Bills us a $200 \"late\" bunny fee. Tells us they gave us a PAPER notification about the rabbit hutch outside when we never received one. Asked for email in addition to a paper notice just in case...no response. Someone else literally has a bed frame out on their deck, and we can't have a hutch? Lack of communication. But they can send emails out, I wonder why? Why bother having a 5 hour office hour when you're hardly there for 3 days out of the week?[October 1, 2017] It's not our fault that you refused to meet us to show us the unit and sign the lease just because it was \"your day off\". We set a time to meet, waited 2 hours. Never showed. [October 2, 2017] We had to extend our Uhaul another 24 hours and try to move everything into the unit before one of us had to return the Uhaul AND get to work on time. Physically let the maintenance guy know about the walls, said he'd come in later the week. No show. When we came that morning they didn't seem to expect us to show up and had to rush to get all the paperwork ready, which is probably how they forgot about our pet fee. STILL not OUR fault. We signed, paid for the deposit + first month's rent assuming we were also charged for the pet fee. And here we are now. I don't expect to stay here much longer after our lease is done. Worst service I've ever experienced.",

This dissatisfaction is precisely why we no longer bend on our move-in dates for residents, even if they plead with us to allow them to move in sooner. Unfortunately, things fall through the cracks, such as an overlooked pet or not enough time to perform touch up painting, which was the downside to your move in.\n\nIn reference to unauthorized items on patios, please understand that everyone who is in violation of these policies is notified to rectify them, whether the tenant does so immediately is a different story. In which case we continue to take action with these tenants who are in violation.\n\nThank you for being prompt to comply with the patio polices.\n\nWe wish you all the best in your further adventures in the renting world."

        "review": "I have not actually dealt with the owners or any staff...but I have been waiting a good almost 10 minutes for someone to come by the office in romark flats to apply for their 2 bed 1 bath apartment. The office is not supposed to close till 2. There is no one inside and doors are locked. I am giving it 3 stars just cause I haven't actually dealt with anyone but I may have to adjust that depending on if someone shows up. This is not good business. No \"out to lunch\" sign or any sign of when they will be back and I even met a tenant from one of their buildings. Says it was a pain and a half to get into his apartment but after that he hasn't had to deal with them much. Good rent, beautiful apartments. But so far as I can tell good luck getting in. I'm gonna walk over to windermere and see if they can work with me.\n\nUPDATE: i have since not only met with their stafg but have moved into an apartment here. I must admit im glad i only gave them 3 before because ot was fair for having not met them. Upon meeting her and moving in she has shown me why they have such great reviews. Knowing it was my first place she helped me with the walkthrough and checklist stuff so when i eventally move out, which i dont see happening fof some time, i wouldnt be charged for things that were not my fault which she could have stayed silent. Let me fill out the form and then charge me at the end like crazy. Now not to say there was a bunch wrong. A ding here, some chipped plaster there. For someone like myself nothing too huge. Standard wear and tear living. But i never would have marked it if she had not been so helpful.\n\nI will say my only gripe about this place if anything given how awesome erin has been and helpful too is the lack of an elevator. I have a handicapped younger brother and elderly grandparents who would love to stop by but alot of planning has to go into ot to make sure they can get up the stairs or im there or someone is who will carry my brothers wheelchair up the stairs. However their ground floor units look awesome and have just from the few peaks i have gotten from open shutters and walking around between my apartment and the mailbox. So im sure if they did get someone who needs handicap accessible housing they could accomate if a ground floor apartment was available.\n\nEven if they added an extra little wheelchair lift id rate this place even higher. But for now 5 stars is certainly what romark flatts and erin are worth as i love living here so far.",

        "review": "Positives: the office gals were always friendly to us and did their best to assist and for the space, they were a good price compared to the surrounding area - $1150 for a 2 bed/1 bath. We also loved how wide they made the staircases as this was helpful when moving in. The layout overall was also nice! It felt secluded with the surrounding nature which was part of what drew us there. \n\nNegatives: pieces of Willy Flats and the owner. The owner is not a \"people person\" at all and has no manners that we - or the neighbors we would often chat with - ever saw. He literally yelled at my partner (while he was letting our dog pee in a grassy area) telling him he isn't allowed to pee on the concrete (what dog chooses to pee on concrete?!) or on site - which the lease didn't state anywhere and there's no designated pet area on site and the apartments have nothing near by. He didn't even introduce himself or apologize after my partner corrected what the owner thought he was doing. \n\nSo, on to the apartments...they look nice overall but you can tell that they bought whatever materials could be found because few of the apartments even actually match and even within the apartment there are three different \"wood\" colors ranging from blonde to red tones - so random. The walls between people's living rooms and the next tenants bedroom are quite thin. You can hear whole conversations type thin...the floor is so cheap that dropping and ICE PACK dented it. Literally dented it. There were dents in the floor before we even moved in and we were the first ones to ever live there. There is no guest parking on site, and the apartments are in a random area with no alternate parking options available - not even a shoulder on the main road. People were CONSTANTLY making a huge mess of the trash/recycle area. They really just need to put money into cameras so they know who is abusing the rules, but it seems the owner was too cheap? So instead, every month that people made a mess of the area they would charge extra to ALL tenants. \n\nAll in all, not a great experience. Seems more of a money focus as a whole. If it weren't for the kind office staff, it'd be a 1 star.",

I ended up getting a job out of state and had to break my lease. I contacted Erin and was informed that my deposit would be forfeit (fair, I signed a contract after all) , but that she would try to rent my unit so I would not be responsible for rent for the remaining 2 months. I moved out mid-month, so she told me to pay the full month's rent and that should cover cleaning costs, carpet (I have animals and there is a fee listed for this in the lease), and any damage. That seemed fair to me, so I did that, not expecting to get any money back. Not only did she rent my unit, saving me a lot of money, but I was just notified that I'm getting a lot of the rent overpayment back. I did return the apartment clean and without damage, but like I said, I didn't anticipate getting any money back. I'm shocked. Roma is the first property management company that I've had where I've walked away feeling like I was treated fairly, they are so lucky to have Erin. And that's saying something, because I did break my lease and normally that would make for a bad end. I would definitely recommend renting from them if you're in Whatcom County!",

They have gaslighted me and they will pretend they haven't gotten your call or letters. I like trusting my landlord.",

        "review": "This company will not only use up all of your security deposit, but they will also charge you EXTRA for bogus reasons. They have failed to do any maintenance requests when you request them, they will set up all these random fees and won't answer any calls or emails when you try to reach them. Their listings are all over priced and the parking is a joke. Beware if you are a tenant or a potential tenant. Oh, and not to mention how unprofessional they are. They have their business hours set up so that no tenant can reach them in normal business hours. I hope they never screw anyone over like they did with the people I know who lived at one of their managed properties. No other management company is as terrible as these people are.",

        "review": "Amanda the \"senior property manager\", argued with my girlfriend about what room number we lived in for an extra key to borrow, my girlfriend was unsurprisingly right and Amanda offered no apology. The owner is the maintenance worker also and when our door lock broke and he replaced it the Management didn't have a copy of that new key after. We also didn't get a call from him when it became 3 hours past our appointment just because he was \"busy\" after we had to call him. And when we couldn't tell if our overhead fan in the kitchen was on because it's so weak he also could barely hear it and he left it like that and had the nerve to ask how much we cook, really?!! There are no security cameras even though it's next to a busy street where we have had to call the cops multiple times for suspicious activity, I got told by a neighbor we have had package thefts too. There's been a lot of cutting corners and poor owner effort for resolutions. Plus the complaints they send us for having a cat that likes to sit on the window ledge, surprise animals like sunshine and we're on the first floor so we aren't just going to have our windows open... And that's why we pay a pet deposit, right? No guest parking... That should say a lot on it's own. Poorly insulted windows and door jams for \"brand new\". They care about the employees first by a long shot, just look at the hours of operations... It's laughable. Amanda bring her kids to work often and it's obviously more disorganized when that happens. ...So I wouldn't recommend Roma unless you want disrespectful, cheap and selfish management. Erin is great on her own so we feel bad she has to work with the other two. Growing up in Bellingham I'm really disappointed in this property's leadership, it's just \"new money suckers\" here.",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>        <p>This article is generated by ChatGPT and is only intended to be a tool to help you find a property management company or rental property. The information provided in this article is a summary of user reviews for Roma Management and does not reflect the opinions of ChatGPT itself. The content is intended to provide an overview of different experiences and does not include personally identifiable information about the reviewers.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>The Good</h2>        <p>User reviews on Roma Management often spoke highly of the responsiveness and professionalism of the staff, particularly Erin, who was mentioned numerous times for her helpfulness and dedication. Residents felt cared for and appreciated the company's swift action on various matters. One tenant cited an instance where the management team was described as going above and friendliness, promising some reviewers a sense of being valued and heard.</p>    <p>In regard to customer service, several users mentioned that the application and move-in processes were made exceptionally smooth and fast, thanks to the support provided. This proactive attitude seems to be a common theme, with the management taking steps to assist residents in times of need and replying to their concerns and queries with genuine care. Additionally, some users appreciated the attention to tenant needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that Roma Management puts effort into maintaining the well-being of its community.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>The Great</h2>        <p>Many reviews highlighted Roma Management\u2019s ability to exceed expectations, particularly with the maintenance and repair issues. Before Roma\u2019s involvement, several users mentioned experiencing delays or complete inaction from previous managers; however, under Roma\u2019s watch, repairs were handled more efficiently. For instance, one user expressed relief and satisfaction that things got fixed quickly after Roma took over the property, improving their rental experience significantly.</p>    <p>Another strong suit mentioned in the user reviews is communication. Roma Management is commended for its engagement and communication with tenants, with the staff praised for their prompt and warm responses. The reviews point out that tenants received quick replies to their maintenance requests and inquiries. One user review happily noted that after moving in, Roma Management addressed all the repair concerns in a timely manner, leading to a positive remark on the maintenance delivery system.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>The Bad</h2>        <p>Despite positive comments, there are issues that some tenants have found concerning. A considerable number of reviews pointed out that the parking situation at some Roma Management properties has been problematic. Tenants have experienced issues like assigned spots being occupied by unauthorized vehicles and inadequate parking space for guests.</p>    <p>Other negative reviews focus on maintenance delays. While the staff was generally warm and kind, some users reported waiting longer than expected for maintenance completion. For one individual, a seemingly simple door repair was stretched out over an extended period, conveying frustration over the timeline in which fixes were addressed. This suggests potential space for improvement in managing and executing maintenance requests.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>The Ugly</h2>        <p>Perhaps the most concerning aspect from user reviews is the deposit retention and end-of-tenancy charges. Some tenants have expressed dissatisfaction with charges applied upon moving out, which they felt were unfair or not in line with their expectations. There was mention of users not receiving a complete deposit back and being additionally charged for conditions they disagreed with, highlighting a lack of clarity around deposit deductions.</p>    <p>Furthermore, communication shortcomings when handling complaints about deposit returns have been noted, with some users stating that reaching the management became difficult after moving out. While these experiences are not universal among Roma Management tenants, they constitute an area of grievance that impacts Roma Management\u2019s overall reputation according to several user reviews.</p>  </section></article>"
