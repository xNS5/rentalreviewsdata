Rude and only was responsive at the very end, during our rental period she lacked communication the entire time, took days for our septic issues, never gave us 24 hour notice when a person came over, never fixed the things she said would be fixed/replaced and shes been extremely unprofessional and unpleasant in the end of our rental period, texting us rude comments often. Do not recommend dealing with her.",

        "review": "We will never rent a property through RPMT - Teyata, if, I have to deal with Kalli Hyde again. She was only available and went above and beyond when we wanted to rent a property. After renting, it was like we were put on the back burner and forgotten.\n\nWe have placed six maintenance requests; two were completed and one we figured ourselves. Two of the same maintenance requests placed; first request completed but the second request was never followed up by the property manager. One of the request, the request was followed up and we sent pictures regarding the issue but no response after that.\n\nWhen sending emails to Kalli, either she took more than 72 hours or never responds. When my husband was able to get a hold of her on the phone, you can tell by her tone of voice that she was frustrated and annoyed of him. If, she doesn't want to continue to provide good customer service, then she needs to be replace by someone who can.",

          "text": "I'm sorry to hear about your experience with our company and understand your concerns. The way that we process work orders heavily relies on tenants submitting those through the work order system we have in place. \n\nI took a look into all of the work orders submitted during your tenancy from most recent to oldest: \n\n1. Outdoor hose bib: 4/16 tenant submitted work order in the system, on 4/19 vendor supplied estimate. Due to your work schedules, and your upcoming move out, it was agreed upon and voiced immediately to please not use that hose bib and vendor will take care of it upon your move out. Considering it was less than a month out. \n\n2. Kitchen counter water spot repair: 8/17 tenant submitted, we contacted the vendor immediately, they put it on their schedule for end of September. Considering this was not an urgent maintenance request, we worked off the vendors schedule. \n\n3. Lower bathroom leak: 9/15 tenant submitted, on 9/18 vendor supplied us with estimate, plumber coordinated with tenant and owner directly and completed from there. \n\n4. Light chain broken on ceiling fan: 11/30 tenant submitted, on 12/12 vendor supplied estimate, on 12/14 we informed you that owner has decided since the light still worked without the chain, there was no need to move forward with repair. \n\n5. Dishwasher not draining: 11/30 tenant submitted, on 12/04 vendor confirmed scheduled, notice was sent to you as tenants same day, 12/19 vendor came out. \n\n6. Light switch broken: \n11/30 tenant submitted, 12/05 owner approved repair,\n12/19 vendor completed repair\n\n7. Fireplace gas insert not working (did not work even prior to tenants moving in, and that was voiced to the tenants): 12/08 tenant submitted, 12/19 estimate given by vendor, 12/20 voiced to tenant that the owner has decided to not move forward with this repair at this current time. \n\nWe understand your concerns, although we have a direct maintenance line via our company phone line that would direct you to our maintenance team in the event Kalli was unavailable, or a work order was sent directly to her. \n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the maintenance concerns during your tenancy, please go ahead and reach out to us to chat about them at any time. \n\nBest of luck to you and your family, \nThe Teyata Team. \n"

        "review": "Terrible property management.. Started out great but once our original property manager left the company it has been all downhill. Both the tenant and myself have gone weeks without return calls from our supposed property manager. When we finally hear back it is one excuse after the other from lost phone to locked out of emails, to never got any messages and so on. Once we reached out to the renters the many made up stories didn't add up. Unprofessional and dishonest. If you are looking for a property manager save yourself some headache and keep looking",

          "text": "John, \n\nThank you for reaching out. We apologize for the troubles you feel are an issue here. As a company, we strive to ensure we keep an open line of communication between us and the owners, and us as the tenants. However, keep in mind that your tenants have not voiced anything along the lines of these concerns to us, as they have utilized all parties involved to get in contact with if your property manager is unavailable. I am sorry you feel as if we have been dishonest. Just to point out that this all started with your assumptions of the previous tenant being responsible for replacing the appliances, where as that was not expressed to us, nor in the previous lease agreement with the old tenants. When the time came, and we had to get a new appliance is when most of your concerns arose, and you stopped communicating to us. I understand how you may feel as though in that situation we are being dishonest, and truly apologize for making it seem as that or making excuses, where as our intent is to layout all info for you whether or not it is something you wanted to hear. Sometimes that may be letting you know what came up in a certain situation, but that line of communication will always be there if you are opening to communicating with us. \nPlease feel free to reach out to us via text or call for further assistance."

        "review": "We started using RPM Teyata in January of 2021, slowly transferring properties to them throughout the year.  We intentionally waited to review RPM until we had been working with them for a year.  With 9 units now under their management and a year's worth of experience with them, we can honestly say that we would strongly recommend them!\n\nKellie is an absolute pleasure to work with! She is very professional, communication is great, and she genuinely has our best interest at heart and cares about taking the best care of our properties and our tenants, both of which are very important to us.  We feel confident having her represent us.\n\nEric handles the billing side and is also great to work with.  He is pleasant, knowledgeable, and professional.  Rental deposits are consistently on time and accurate.  Questions are always addressed and either clarified or resolved without having to repeatedly revisit and waste time, which we really appreciate.\n\nWe have self-managed for about 12 years and had reached a point where, with personal obligations, it was just too much.  We tried another company first, but the knowledge and experience of the support staff was lacking and inconsistent, communication was poor, accounting was unintelligible at times, and follow-through was awful.  Mistakes are to be expected in life (from us as well), but the key with RPM has been great communication and consistent and competent execution of whatever task is at hand.\n\nWe have been very pleased with Kellie and RPM Teyata and the load they have taken off of us.  Thank you, Kellie!!\n\nRob and Angie Scofidio",

We love our little place and Kellie has laid all our concerns to rest. They provide pics so that you can see exactly what it looks like inside and out. And the detail she provides is incredible. She has also done many little extra things at no cost and has actually really acted as an owner in her care for our place and fixed and put back little things like it was a place that she loved herself.

They raised the rent after a year, plus raised it another $500 when we left. They took pretty much our entire security deposit. They charged an exorbitant fee for landscaping even though when we first arrived, the yard was just a sand pit and invasive blackberry. I took time to plant native plants and clover but they still decided to charge about $600 from the deposit for that. They hire the cheapest labor possible so cabinets just fell apart, fridge stopped working, the paint job was horrible.\n\nPipes froze and burst both summers.

I wish I had done this before and avoided all the headaches I had with the other company.\nRight now, they're leasing my property.

          "text": "Jennifer,\n \nThank you for taking the time to share your experience. We are truly sorry in how this has played out, and is being perceived. However, the water coming into the basement and the necessary mold remediation were not our fault. We worked with you and the tenants to the best of our ability during the 5 months we managed your property.  We realize that you were unaware about the foundation issues that caused the primary bedroom and bathroom to be unusable to the tenants. This left both parties in an unideal situation as the tenants could not use/occupy part of their rental property, and you did not have the financial backing to support that fix at that moment. Per your email to the tenants (which we have, and can happily share), you agreed to let them out of their lease as well as agreed to refund all of their previous rent payments and entire security deposit. After they moved out, you changed your mind about this agreement and would not refund them. Taking this information into account and referring to your original email with the tenants, there was no fraud on our part. We then gave you all the rent we collected from the tenants from the date they moved in to the date they moved out (minus our management fees). We also provided statements twice a month through the contract period accounting for all funds collected. Yes, we did refund the entire security deposit back to the tenants as you originally agreed to do. Honestly, I was shocked to see this review because you know how hard we worked to keep them from seeking legal action, and in the best interest for you. We understand that a rental property is a huge investment on your end (the owners), and I am sorry that this was not a positive experience for you. I sincerely regret any negative feelings you may have gained due to this experience, and genuinely appreciate your feedback, and please know that we take all feedback, good and bad, very seriously. We can only learn from these experiences and do better in the future. \n\nKindest regards,\nThe Teyata Team.\n\n"

One common complaint involves difficulty getting timely responses to inquiries or maintenance requests, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction among tenants. Another user mentioned the delay and inconsistency in addressing maintenance concerns, such as broken appliances and leaks, which were often highlighted but resolved only after considerable delays or follow-ups. Such experiences diminish the rental experience, causing some renters to advise others to consider alternative property management services.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>A few reviews narrate particularly negative experiences with RPM Teyata, including allegations of unprofessional conduct and neglect of tenant rights. One reviewer described how issues such as mold and faulty plumbing were left unresolved, along with a lack of follow-up on these serious matters, suggesting a systemic failure in tenant care.

These accounts paint a troubling picture of certain interactions with the management that involve unmet contractual obligations and communication breakdowns, leading to a severely tarnished impression of the company.</p></section>"
