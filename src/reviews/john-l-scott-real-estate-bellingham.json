        "review": "Mira is so much more than a realtor to us. We moved from the east side of the state and wanted to make sure that this move was into a home, not just a house. Mira was recommended to us by our realtor Jessica Griffiths-Granly. Jessica had seen us through two sales and a purchase so we trusted her to find us the perfect person to help with our buy in Whatcom county. I never would have imagined how perfect of a person she found. Mira talked with us before we even started looking at houses to get to know who we were and exactly what we wanted and needed. The work she put in was above and beyond. She genuinely cared from minute one! While battling health issues I was so nervous about everything that a move meant, but Mira was my superhero! She did the legwork and found us amazing options to look through and set us up with everything we needed to make a decision. We wanted more than a house. We wanted community, activities, a place where our children could grow up and we could live in peace without losing our connection with the world. We narrowed our list thanks to Miras hard work and video tours that showed us more than the walls and floors but the feel of each home. Because she took the time to get to know us she was able to show us what would work in each home and what she thought wouldnt. We drove up one weekend and toured 14 homes in one day! With a 4 year old and 13 year old in tow that can be difficult but Mira made it so easy! She kept the kids interested with the aspects of each place meant for them and even answered all the questions my curious 4 year old threw at her without skipping a beat with us. We ended up finding the perfect home for us, in the most beautiful neighborhood, with everything we had hoped for! We figured we might have to settle on some of our wants but Mira found us the exact home and community we wanted to be apart of. She even did a tour of a park nearby that my kids fell in love with!! Mira kept on working every step of the way. She even coordinated with our home sale realtor to make sure everything flowed despite some issues from the sale of our previous home. When we signed and closed Mira didnt just shake our hand and move on. She made sure everything was setup! When we found out the gas had been turned off she was kind enough to bring us a heater to make sure we werent cold until things got figured out! Everyday we have spent in our new home has been beautiful and joyous and the community is so much more than we even hoped for! Mira is so much more than a realtor to us, she helped bring us home. We are forever grateful for everything she did, which I cant even write in its entirety. If you want a home you want Mira Gregory on your team!",

It makes all the difference in the world when you have that in a good and solid realtor you can trust.  We were fortunate to have Peter Roberts from John L. Scott to help us through the daunting task of selling our family home.\n\nPeter has many years of doing this. In that time he has experienced all manner of what a seller will find as they work through the process. He took the time to explain the important details of the sale, and what to honestly expect at every turn. He helped us understand what was happening at every step of selling our family home.\n\nWe always felt like we were working with a good friend as well as a competent realtor. I know youll find him as effective and helpful as we have. Peter is highly recommended by our family.",

From our very first meeting, both these ladies worked hard to understand my vision, needs, and budget. Their patience never waivered as we looked at property after property. Lee's and Mira's first hand knowledge of the area, combined with a wide network and a commitment to client satisfaction, made all the difference.\n\nFor anyone looking for a property in Birch Bay or the surrounding areas, I can't recommend Lee and Mira highly enough.

Their approach to the sale of my home brought the best of meaningful market analysis and artistic creativity to allow my home to sell for its full potential thus allowing me to maximize my equity!\n\nMy wife and I will be back to Bellingham in the future, when the time comes there is only ONE team that we will enlisting the help of ...

However I got everything I could ask for and then some in a real estate agent when I chose to go with William Elmer, he was always in contact, he would answer every question I had to help me be informed and not overwhelmed with everything, and most importantly he never made me feel pressured to make a decision and allowed the whole process to take its course organically. I know this was only my first home purchase but I can tell you that with me William has earned a customer for life.

From the start she proved she had our best interests in mind by sitting us down to explain the house buying process and really preparing us.

Wed connected with her via our friends who run a local Forest School, so we knew she was going to understand us and our values and interests well.\n\nBefore we even moved to Bellingham, she made time to connect with us over a call and we kept in touch for several months before we lived here. It felt like we were already friends before Bellingham became our home! We chose to move into a rental and begin getting to know the city well, before purchasing, and she even helped point us in the right direction to find a great rental.\n\nBrianna started showing homes for us even though we weren't planning on purchasing in Bellingham until Spring 2023. Through her, we got a feel for Bellingham's neighborhoods and the market here. When we happened upon a house with the potential to be our family's forever home, Brianna was on it. We got our forever home and property for under asking, and Brianna's recommendation to use Umpqua Bank got us in with a great local lender we otherwise might not have discovered. I cannot overstate how good she was during the negotiation phase; she ensured we got a fair price from sellers who were holding out hope that the former market would return.\n\nThroughout our journey, Brianna was helpful, timely, and knowledgeable about the quirks and considerations of the houses we toured. She tried different options based on our guidelines, paid close attention to our feedback, and never suggested a house similar to one we previously disliked. Even though we were an uncertain bet, we never felt like a lower priority. If you are new to town and want to thoroughly understand the area without feeling pressure to just bid on houses, Brianna is a great choice.",

        "review": "Mira provided superb representation during our recent purchase of a home in Sudden Valley. Her assistance began 8 months earlier, helping my wife during a trip to Washington to scout possible relocation areas in the PNW. We were living in Maryland at the time. We were planning on moving West during the summer. For the next several months Mira provided several candidate listings and suggestions on which communities would fit our lifestyle. When we arrived in July, we shifted to an intense house hunting effort and Mira easily stepped up to our needs. Within a week we submitted our first offer, it was rejected, and then we quickly pivoted to another, even better home to submit a second offer. Mira expertly guided through the process. We ended up beating a competing offer, mostly because of Mira's knowledge of the seller's needs. She made a great recommendation for a home inspector.  We closed in less than 30 days. And she has continued to check up on us. Hands down the best buyers rep we have had!",

As we were looking for homes from out of state, we sought an agent with great communication skills, strong business acumen and knowledge about the community we were looking to relocate within, and Mira went above and beyond to deliver on all fronts. Since we werent able to view homes in person, Mira curated detailed video walk-throughs of multiple listings for us and put together comprehensive information about the properties to assist us in our search. When we found the one, our forever home, Mira was a fierce advocate for us; through two time zones and 2,300 miles of physical distance, Mira built relationships with both of us and has gone out of her way to make our entire family feel welcomed and settled in our new dream home in the Pacific Northwest! From a very happy new homeowner, I highly recommend Mira for your realtor needs; she is a gem to work with and an absolute asset to anyone in the real estate market.",

He is very knowledgeable about the area, the process, negotiating, and how to structure a contract that can win in this nutty market!

She is a wonderful agent who cares a lot about her clients, she made things so easy, and dealt\nso patiently with my anxiety. She managed to have the closing of both properties on the same day, and that saved me a lot of money because I didnt need a bridge loan. I recommend her highly!

I outlined exactly what we were looking for and what fit our budget --- more importantly the timeline in which we needed. Patrick was professional, timely in his responses, and always answered any questions we had. As you can imagine, buying a home can be overwhelming and the list of questions can pile up but he took care of all our concerns and made the process less stressful than I imagined. Patrick is innovative in his approach to find the home for you. To illustrate to you what I mean, the budget and style of home we wanted was high in demand and nearly impossible to get an offer on. Each listing that popped up would be pending shortly thereafter. Patrick found ways to get us into what we needed by prior referrals and off market listings and that is exactly how we got our home: off-market and no bidding wars to delay our move.
