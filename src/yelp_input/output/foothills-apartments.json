        "review": "The foothills apartments give me dirty crack den vibes. I've been living here for the past year with my significant other and we're ACTIVELY trying to find anywhere else to live but what I can call the lowest end dumps in the deepest depths of hell itself. We pay 915 for a one bedroom but come a few months from now, our place will be 1050 a month. We have walls so thin I doubt paper would be a good analogy for how gaunt the walls are. We don't have any sort of dishwasher in our place and we have disruptive neighbors who play piano at odd hours and take long noisy showers also at odd hours. Our bedroom and living room will be freezing cold if we don't keep our heaters on at all hours of the day, that jacks up our electric bill quite a bit as well. The pot holes are atrocious and I'm sure they keep f'ing up the brakes of our vehicle. They claim to have a swimming pool but it's always covered and actually FILLED WITH DIRT. So, they lie, we have a leak in the ceiling and I have called the royce group about it but they haven't called back or tried to send a maintenance guy over to patch it up. The water here goes cold within minutes so you better like taking speedy showers. Oh, and our power just shuts off because the breakers get overloaded by a lamp. Most of the switches and outlets are dead in our apartment so getting things to power up is scarce to say the least. They also overcharged us to move in. 915 a month for rent but I paid nearly 3200 bucks to get a place here. Quite a rip-off and I'm concerned I'll be not able to move out since I'm straddling the poverty line. I cannot recommend these dirt bags to anyone. Hope I don't get evicted for this review!",
