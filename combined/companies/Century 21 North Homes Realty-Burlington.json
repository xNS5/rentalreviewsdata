      "review": "I needed to rent my house and went looking in the phone book for a real estate agent to manage my property. I really lucked out when I found Jim Lyons at Century 21. He has been doing rentals for years and really knows his stuff! He is easy going and very helpful. As a first time landlord, I had a lot of questions. He helped me though the process and made it almost seem easy. I have been with him over 6 years now and he has helped me not only find a great tenant but also with the any issues that have come up. I think he does a great job and would recommend him to everyone!",
