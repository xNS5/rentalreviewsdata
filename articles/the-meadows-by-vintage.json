        "review": "My opinion on these apartments may be biased because when I was young I used to hang out here and stay with friends (back when they were Larkin Apartments)\n\nI live here now and have to say the apartments are big. The neighborhood is nice. There's trails right behind the apartments. Plenty of places to walk.\n\nThe people who work in the office are nice.\n\nJust as with any apartments you have to deal with certain things. But I don't hear my neighbors and they have said they don't hear me. Which is a blessing because I have 3 kids and live on the 3rd floor :)",

The location of this Community speaks for itself: parks, silence, beautiful air. The office staff is caring and we are grateful to Jim and Casey for all their efforts. However, it is obvious that such a small team is not enough to carry out all the work on the complex efficiently. We are glad to meet you and hope that in the future everything will change only for the better. Thank you !",

        "review": "We lived at the Meadows apartments for a year before we had to relocate for work.\n\nWe loved our spacious, comfortable and affordable apartment from the first moment we stepped in there and saw the duck pond from the living room door to the balcony.\n\nIt was a delight to be able to watch the view, the seasons change, the sun rise and the wild life at the pond from our porch. We did move in during the winter and it was very quiet. It does get noisier in the summer with the ducks, bull frogs and kids running around, but these are all sounds that I like hearing, so it wasn't an issue for me.\n\nThe one thing that I would change if I could was the insanely long paperwork process we had to go through to rent the apartment. We had no clue what we were getting into and probably wouldn't go through it if we knew, so it's good that we didn't. That's not on the company, it's the state requirements for this type of rental.\n\nFortunately for us, Jim, the office manager, helped us with every needed step. He truly has endless patience and we're super grateful for his professional help and support throughout the whole process and generally the whole time we lived there.\n\nJim also handled every request we had for things that needed to be fixed in the house very quickly and we very much appreciated having Casey, the maintenance man with a huge heart, come over and take care of things, when needed.\n\nAll together we liked the location, the neighborhood, the apartment, the view, the price and the good service we got from Jim and Casey, so I recommend this place to anyone who is willing to go though the lengthy required rental process.",

        "review": "I have lived here for five, almost six years and seen MANY changes. One of the most constant things that I have noticed is the kind, courteous, and professional way that I have been treated over the last several years. Living with a disability can be tough, but the staff here have never failed to treat me with the same kindness, and understanding as I treat them, and I really love that.  The rent here is super low, and the newest landlady, Melissa has been absolutely amazing. Her solid work ethic, big heart, and dedication have really done wonders in improving the place to not just livable, but absolutely high quality, family living. I wake up each and every day, and I know that I am blessed to have not just a lovely apartment, great room mates, and the most wonderful land lady and staff that I could ever ask for \n\nUpdate: I have lived here for ten years now and am now seeing some very big changes. The leases offered are now only 30 days which feels scary and sort of unstable but I may end up liking the auto renew more I'm not sure yet.  Parking is now all paid (you pay to register your car and now also pay additionally if you'd like it covered which is fine) I've recently had alot of experiences that have been really hard for me emotionally but I've chosen to leave them out. What I will tell you is this. Read reviews before moving in. Then make your decision. There are many pros to living here. After ten years this place has felt like my home. The location is PERFECT right on the busline every 30 minutes. Walking distance from Cordata school and whatcom community college, the mall and several stores. The maintenance guy Casey is kind, professional and experienced. I don't really have much else to say so I guess that's my update :)",

I put in a maintenance request about a week ago and they haven't even came to look at it or try to fix it. Don't move into these apartments if you want your things to be fixed  without hassle.\n\nUpdate: Its now fixed, things are crazy right now because they are giving the place a face lift. I was told that's why it took so long",

        "review": "DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!!!\n\nThese people were nice and helpful when you live there, once you move out, they will show you their true faces. They billed me $3383 after we moved out!!!!\n\nBefore we moved out, the manager said that we had to pay only until the last day we stayed (which is only 2 days of the new billing circle) then they billed us for the whole month.\n\nThey also billed us for the new carpet replacement of more than $1600 saying that they replaced the carpet before we moved in and after we moved out, which is a lie. Before we moved in we were told to wait for a few days because they just shampooed the carpet. Then after we moved in, the carpet was still wet and it took almost a month till the carpet got dry. I also talked to the new tenant of the apt and he said the carpet was not replaced, they just cleaned it because when he moved in the whole floor was damp.\n\nToday I went there to talk to the manager, she was totally ignorant and rude. She asked me to talk to the credit company that handles my case while she was the one who prepared the bill to cheat my money. She even threatened to call the police on me. Such a horrible place, I so regret that I gave them 2 years of rent.\n\nThe Meadows by Vintage, dishonest business won't get you anywhere! You guys are supposed to help low income people, not to scam them. I hope there will be more people who raise their voices so police will investigate this place.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>The Meadows by Vintage generally receives positive feedback for its spacious and comfortable apartments, as mentioned in several user reviews. Many tenants appreciate the scenic views, such as the duck pond visible from the apartment balconies, which adds charm to their living experience. The neighborhood's tranquility and the property's proximity to recreational trails make it an appealing residential choice. Additionally, residents praise the friendly and helpful office staff, who provide a welcoming atmosphere. The office team, including individuals like Jim and Casey, is often highlighted for their dedicated efforts, even though some users feel the team might be understaffed for the growing demands of the complex. This feedback aligns with the company\u2019s goal of offering a pleasant living environment, as shown by their prompt owner responses to reviews, thanking residents for their appreciation.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Exceptional reviews highlight the property management's responsiveness and excellent maintenance services. Several users have shared their satisfaction with the quick resolution of maintenance requests, such as the swift installation of a new toilet, which exceeded one resident's expectations for timely service. The maintenance team, particularly Casey, is commended for professionalism and efficient handling of repairs, contributing significantly to resident satisfaction. Furthermore, the management team is praised for their supportive approach during the rental process. A tenant who recently relocated noted Jim's exceptional patience and assistance throughout the extensive paperwork process, making their transition smoother. The courteous treatment received by those with specific needs underscores the community's dedication to inclusivity. The positive experiences and memorable interactions demonstrate the property's commitment to a high-quality living experience.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite a generally positive reception, some residents have expressed concerns that moderate their overall satisfaction with The Meadows by Vintage. A recurring issue mentioned in user reviews is delayed maintenance responses, such as a broken stair light that persisted for over a week, complicating daily routines and causing inconvenience. Such delays, although eventually resolved, can diminish the overall experience for residents who expect prompt service. Another aspect raised is the complexity of the rental process, which, although eventually facilitated by staff, was noted as lengthy and cumbersome by tenants. While the team is helpful, these administrative challenges can initially deter prospective renters. Management acknowledges these critiques, offering apologies and striving for improvements through their owner responses, but there's an evident need to address these areas proactively to enhance tenant satisfaction further.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Unfortunately, some experiences at The Meadows by Vintage have been particularly distressing for certain residents, leading to severely negative feedback. In one striking account, a former tenant reported an exorbitant charge upon moving out, amounting to over $3,000, including unexpected fees for carpet replacement and an entire month's rent that was initially communicated as unnecessary. Such miscommunication and the subsequent financial burden left a significant mark on their experience, leading to accusations of dishonesty and an unpleasant exit. This user also recounted a confrontational interaction with management when trying to resolve the issue, further exacerbating the situation. While instances like these seem to be less common, they highlight critical areas for improvement in transparency and post-tenancy relations, as underscored by the property's management seeking resolution and expressing a desire to refine their processes in response to such feedback.</p></section>"
