They up the rent whenever a unit is available and have no clear amounts (as verified on their own site)\n- Not to step in dog poo (even if you don't have a dog)\n- Peace in your apartment because it's noisy as all get-out\n\nSo yeah, location and maintenance are awesome, everything else sucks!",

When I asked if they were going to take care of this they pretty much told me that they were not going to do anything about it because it is too expensive. The person who told me this also doesnt even live here and has a nice SUV so to them it doesnt seem like a problem but they clearly do not care about the others who dont have that same luxury.",

Rent used to be 1300 just a few years ago, and every single year they have hiked it up more than $100+. I implore everyone to PLEASE look around Bellingham. There is no longer a housing shortage and many apartment complexes have 2 bedrooms/1 baths around $1500 for rent, whereas this complex is charging nearly $1800 for a ONE bedroom with no additional amenities. This place is NOT worth it, and I did not find the front desk very helpful during my time there.\n\nDON'T RENT HERE!!!",

The staff is super friendly and helpful and are really looking out for your best interest. They are open every day and the office is on site so any questions or concerns are handled promptly. We would definitely recommend this pet friendly complex to anyone.",

We got so lucky to have chosen these apartments. The office staff--Sarah and Tonia--were unfailing friendly, personable, approachable and kind. Their maintenance crew were always present and active and responded to Maintenance request promptly and reliably.\nThe complex itself is very quiet and peaceful with most tenants keeping to themselves. The pool, hot tub and gym facilities were well maintained and easily accessible.\nThe units are as-advertised and though they are not cheap, they fall within the average rental rates for the area.\nWe moved not from wanting anything other than to live in a bigger house with our own yard.",

Bob does a great job of keeping things maintained and Sarah is always on top of anything needed.  Its been a bummer not having the hot tub due to COVID but when its open its my favorite perk.  The community center is now completely remodeled and I cant wait to start being able to use it.  A very warm setting with shuffleboard, a kitchen, fireplace and TV.  Love this place and plane to be here a while longer.",

It took me multiple tries across multiple days, and no one getting back the voicemails I left, to get someone on the phone. Then when they finally picked up, they were rude and unhelpful. Ive been trying so hard to find housing and clearly everyone who works here couldnt care less if people have somewhere to live. The horrible customer service, or lack thereof, made my housing search exponentially harder. Definitely not somewhere I want to live.",

Rent has went way up despite their being no updates and things are getting broken down. I cant get anyone to fix the electrical in my kitchen and Ive learned that the people in the apartment above me have the same issue with the electrical in the kitchen. The staff are not particularly friendly but also very unhelpful. They keep making mistakes with our lease and cant seem to get it figured out.

Very friendly staff that are always accommodating.\n\nFor information on the units; I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bath with the master bedroom having a sink and vanity. The units utilize every inch of what they have to offer. There's storage on the deck, a massive closet inside (think narina), and a coat closet down the hall. If you get the opportunity to live here, pull the trigger! You won't regret it.",

        "review": "First off the staff is A1. Welcoming and friendly they really do the best they can with what they have. My wife and I stayed in two different sizes during our time at Maple Park each had their perks!\n\nOur 3 bedroom had a wonderful fireplace great for chilly winters ( bottom floors only I believe). Spacious, and closet space! All the storage space its just something you don't get in most apartments.\n\nOur 2 bed room was just as spacious surprisingly. We got a top floor unit and it had gorgeous vaulted ceilings and the biggest closet I've ever seen both in the bed and the entry way to the home! Our second apartment was by far our favorite out of the two but its also because we had the greatest neighbors all around us!\n\nThe property grounds are well maintained and staff is helpful and almost always around ( minus nights of course). Assigned parking is nice so you always have a spot especially being close to the college and just being in a town in general that lacks parking at times.\n\nI do know they are working on slowly renovating/updating the units but with the cost of rent increasing as it does in bellingham often I wish our apartment rent reflected the quality of appliances we had. Everything works don't get me wrong, but most of the appliances are outdated and I found they can be fidgety. The linoleum floors are rough in some areas from wear and tear. The carpet is the light brown that basically is a tell all to your life in the apartment be so careful with liquids. Over all its a very loveable space with personality I just wish that for the money they interiors reflected what you pay in rent for the property. The OWNERS really need to put more into it bottom line. We were paying almost 1600 ( we also have two cats so this is woth pet rent btw) for a two bed  two bath and I feel like that deserves some more attention by the ownership. This does not reflect on the staff they do what they can with what they are given.\n\nBut all and all nice area of town not directly downtown but a min away from a bus stop that will take you pretty much anywhere. There is a 3 grocery stores within a 10 min walk from the apartments. Everything is very conveniently located. We surely enjoyed our stay and if we could we would have taken all the staff and our neighbor with us! Thanks for the laughs and all the friendly chats. We love you guys!",

        "review": "I lived at Maple Park Apartments for just over a year. From day one, I felt very comfortable. They had availabliliy when nobody else in town seemed to have any openings. Our apartment was very nicely cleaned and repaired before move in, and the people in the office made everything simple and easy.\nI would say the price was average for a two bedroom in this town. Cheaper is available, but keep in mind it often means a place in a bad state of repair, possibly in a questionable area of town, and the conduct of apartment management varies widely from place to place.\n\nThe employees are all wonderful people. They treated me with respect every time we interacted. When I had maintainence needs, they were addressed quickly and thourouly. Bob the maintainence man specifically would always go above and beyond. When he came in to fix the bathtub faucet, he saw that the shower grout was starting to deteriorate. He worked a time out with me to come fix it the next day instead of requiring another maintainence form, wait period, and unnecessary trouble. The whole maintainence crew was always proactive, competent, and friendly.\n\nTanya in the office was the one to show me the apartment before I moved, and help me through the leasing process. She was a delight to be around and made everything a breeze. The office manager Sarah is just as friendly, and was always there to answer questions or address my needs as a tenant. She seemed to enjoy her job, and know exactly what she was doing.\n\nEveryone is very professional but at the same time, they treat tenants like humans as opposed to many rental agency that seem to see tenants as account numbers rather than individuals. I recommend Maple Park every time I get the chance. Places like this are what we need more of! A big thank you to the whole team at MPA!",

Suhrco, the property management company which oversees the property, recently hired an entirely new staff at this property. The terrible reviews you see along with mine were correct. The management WAS terrible and disrespectful. With the recently hired management now overseeing the property, their books are being put in order, and their customer service skills have vastly improved. I'm hopeful that the management will continue to improve, and I can forgive the mistakes of the idiots who used to manage this property, such as charging me rent for a cat I didn't even own.

        "review": "Been here a month and am already pretty fed up. The facility and apartments themselves aren't bad at all (dryers all suck, but I've found that that's pretty much to be expected in apartment life), but what really gets to me is the staff working the front desk. I wish I remembered everyone's names at this point, but I don't. There's one lady who has been super sweet, one who has been a tubby butthole, and one who is incompetent. Tubby butthole was ridiculously cranky, pissy, and unhelpful to both me and my friend and her parents as I was trying to sign on to my friends existing lease as a roommate. For some reason she was convinced that they were trying to sublet it to me. The second time I came in, she wouldn't even get up to talk to me. She just screeched at me from her desk in the back. The last time I had to go in to actually sign the lease, only the sweet lady was there and she apologized profusely for tubby butthole's behavior.\n\nNow, they have a new girl working there. I called the office asking about storage units and if one was available. She did not know, did not know how to find out, and did not know who to contact. I can give her a pass because she's new, but I was told that everyone else was on vacation and she is the only person there, so I can't actually find out until 3-4 days later. Now, I guess this says more about the people in charge than the employee themselves. Piss poor planning. I wouldn't be surprised if tubby butthole was responsible.\n\nLastly, they are gone a lot and close down the office, during their advertised office hours. I have so far had 2 packages that have not been able to be delivered, at 2 and 3 in the afternoon, which is after lunch hour and far before closing. Also, when in the stages of getting paperwork, I found that again, there were 2 times when the office was closed during the clearly labeled office hours.",

Then it's right in front of WWU parking n Ride no need to walk too far to get to school, and with many bus options as well.\n\nThird every maintenance and repair is done by Maple Park Apartments for free.\n\nThen here's the worst part of living at Maple Park, you have to deal with old grumpy Peggy,\nBe aware when you are dealing with her, she will do anything to make your life difficult, and that's part of life.
