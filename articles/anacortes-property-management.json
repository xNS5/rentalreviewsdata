The one time I found the office open I went in and was asking questions and once it got to my credit  and she found out it wasnt perfect her demeanor completely changed to what I felt was disgust as if I was bothering her  so I left the office  would not recommend going to anacortes property unless someone new takes over management",

She is always making sure the homes she manages are in top notch condition. She is very Professional and communicates well with her tenants, customers and maintenance teams. I highly recommend APM.",

I have emailed her and doesnt return emails until 2-3 days later. Gives you an ultimatum on when she can meet you on her time not yours. I have on multiple occasions asked her to communicate with me on phone but you are not worth her time. Unless you have property you want her to manage she is at your beck and call if you are a renter in need of a rental good luck. I feel sorry for the property owners who are nieve or just dont care she is making them loose money because of her lack of compassion. I will look else where.",

Takes her a few days to respond to emails, calls are not an option with these people and you have to work off of their schedule which is unfortunate if you work the same hours. I'd suggest she take a little more initiative maybe I wouldn't feel like giving a lower score than what I gave. If it wasn't already apparent I highly don't recommend you do business with them.",

The worst person to deal with is Peggy... trust me you'll know when you see her she is the most untrustworthy person, and once you sign up to rent a place through her place of business you will most likely end up regretting it. She uses the fact that you dont want to ruin your credit as a tool to boss you around. Take my warning. DO NOT RENT THROUGH Anacortes Property Management unless you want to be treated as less than dirt.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite some of the unfavorable reviews, there are a few positive aspects of Anacortes Property Management highlighted by users. A significant number of satisfied customers mention the effective management and maintenance of the properties, with Peggy often being commended for ensuring that homes are kept in top-notch condition. This is coupled with praise for her professionalism and effective communication with tenants, owners, and maintenance teams. Some tenants have shared their experience of quick issue resolution, making their rental experience comfortable. Examples include rapid responses from the property manager and immediate handling of any concerns or maintenance requests.</p><p>While positive reviews are fewer in number compared to negative ones, they emphasize that for some clients, their experience with Anacortes Property Management has been stellar. For instance, one reviewer mentioned experiencing a smooth application process with a quick response time, while another found Peggy to be a very nice and pleasant individual to work with. These highlights indicate that while issues persist, there are successful interactions and positive experiences with the company as well.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The 'great' reviews for Anacortes Property Management, though sparse, shine through with glowing commendations for the quality of service provided by Peggy. One user review celebrates her as \"the best property manager\" they've ever rented from, citing her promptness and effectiveness in addressing concerns. The reviewer describes their place as worthy-of-praise, delighting in Peggy\u2019s attentiveness, which they claimed significantly enhances their living experience.</p><p>Another satisfied tenant echoed similar sentiments, acknowledging Peggy's reliability in maintaining property standards and delivering excellent service over a period of five years. This loyalty and continued preference for her management style underline the positive impacts she has had on certain tenants. These reviews illustrate the capacity for excellence held by Anacortes Property Management, as experienced by those who encountered timely and effective service.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Many user reviews highlight communication issues as a significant downfall of Anacortes Property Management, with frequent mentions of unreturned calls and delayed emails. For instance, several users expressed their frustration with the management\u2019s lack of promptness in responding to inquiries and addressing maintenance requests, leading to unnecessary delays and inconveniences. One specific case involved a tenant needing urgent repairs, which took weeks to initiate, showcasing a gap in service delivery for urgent maintenance issues.</p><p>Beyond communication, other aspects of concern include the perceived rigidity in scheduling and the challenges renters face in coordinating viewings or applications. There are reports of properties not being shown on time and essential information not being communicated effectively, leading to missed opportunities for potential renters. Some users mentioned their experience of dealing with a closed or inaccessible office, which compounded their difficulties in reaching the management team and resolving pertinent issues efficiently.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The reviews within this section paint a particularly negative picture, with some renters expressing severe dissatisfaction and distrust towards the management. One reviewer recounted their experience where they felt neglected over critical personal matters, involving delayed communication that resulted in significant personal losses. This sentiment is further echoed by others who felt dismissed or ignored by Peggy and the management team, leading to a perception of unprofessionalism and disrespect from the company.</p><p>Adding to these concerns is the allegation of dishonesty, as highlighted by one user who felt misled regarding property maintenance needs. There are repeated mentions of experiencing rude behavior and a lack of empathy from the management, which further alienates tenants and potential clients. This behavior, coupled with unmet basic expectations such as maintenance handling and communication transparency, contributes to the strong negative sentiments expressed in these reviews. These accumulated negative experiences significantly tarnish the image of Anacortes Property Management among dissatisfied clients.</p></section>"
