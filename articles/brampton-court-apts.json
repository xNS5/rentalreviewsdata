        "review": "This place is absolutely insane. The rent they ask for is ridiculous with the layout. So imagine you're wanting guests to come over for a dinner, or even game night. Let's pretend one of your guests wants to use the restroom, welll that's too bad! They'll have to walk through YOUR ROOM! I can't even open my fridge unless I close my dishwasher, and don't even get my started on the trim. My grandma could've done a better job building the place.",

        "review": "All the negative reviews are from quite awhile ago. My wife and I moved in here in September of 2016 and have had quite a wonderful experience, in fact we just signed a new year lease! \n\nWhen we were looking for apartments, I was initially turned off because of all the yelp reviews, I decided to take a look at the place later on because finding housing is tough around here! \n\nThe rates were great on the site and they allowed pets, but we were looking at the old site. Apparently the old owners own www.bramptoncourt.com but the actual site is www.brampton-court.com \n\nParking can be quite difficult at times as parking permits aren't really enforced, but you can always find a spot (depending on how much you want to walk),some parking spaces can be extremely tight (I recommend going for the bigger ones)\n\nThe noise level is not that bad at all! It all depends on your neighbors, which is true with any complex you live in. \n\nMaintenence is always quick to solve our issues and despite there being no fencing or controlled access, it is a very safe place to live. \n\nSince living there, I've had no break ins or attempted break ins, no stolen packages, and no feeling of being creeped on (besides my inlaws showing up unannounced)\n\nAnyways...... Past reviews don't reflect how it is now :)",

        "review": "This is horrible place to live. The company is updating the apartments to laminate flooring instead of carpeting therefore allowing for very much noise for those who live under anyone. I can hear coins drop. It sounds like the kids above me have a bowling alley. These are just a few examples of the constant noise. \nWhen you want to speak to the administration office with a concern you cant get in contact with anyone or get them to call you back. As soon as the company gets your rent the rest of your concerns are just bullshit  until the first rolls around again.\nPotential renters be aware.",

        "review": "The rental rates on the website are lower than what you end up seeing on the lease, ripoff alert.\n\nYour rent will go up quickly. And you can kiss your $500 deposit goodbye when moving out.\n\nThey will take advantage of college students and Coast Guard people due to the temporary housing needs. \n\nDishonest and bait and switch business. Avoid!",

        "review": "Do Not Rent here. The service is Terrible. When signed our lease we were lied to about being able to sign over our lease to someone else if need be. The Property manager said it was completely okay to do and that it \"happens all the time cause this is a college town\". \n\nWell now that we are trying to sign it over, Jeannie from the Corporate Office, said that we are not allowed to do it. This is AFTER she was okay with it. Originally everything was okay because we had a State of Washington employee ready to take over our lease, then he backed out. Now we have some college kids from California who are ready to take over and now its a problem. Seems like discrimination to me. \n\nI'll never do business with Coast Management ever again.",

        "review": "Way overpriced. There are 2 websites, bramptoncourts.com which is NOT current, and brampton-courts.com which has the current, much higher pricing. 1bed listed on old site is $785, $1025 on new site. These are in no way $1000 apartments. I first stopped by to look at a 1 bedroom and just laughed out loud. It was ok in regards to space and had decent natural light, but it REEKED of smoke even though this is supposed to be a no smoking complex. Also, several of the lights (which are those long industrial bulbs) were out or going out. This was supposed to be move-in ready! Just not at all a $1k apartment. I stopped by one more time to look at what she told me was a different unit. (She didn't realize it was the same one.) They had replaced the carpet and the smoke smell was gone, but it still just wasn't a $1k apartment. No way. I found one at The Edge which actually is one.",

        "review": "My daughter moved in here and has been lied to, bullied by management, and has not had a full night sleep since moving in. She discussed a 6 month lease and was presented with a full year when she went in to sign the paperwork. Since College had already started she signed without consulting anyone, not knowing that type of bait and switch is a huge red flag regarding future interactions.\nThe few times I have tried to visit and spend the night the neighbors are up all night and making a huge amount of noise, the downstairs neighbor is a drinker and smokes like a chimney, the smoke blows directly into my daughters apartment if she even opens her slider door one little crack. The manager Amanda, is the worst person I have ever had the misfortune to encounter, she is the one that lied about the lease and had my daughter sign something doubling the time. Please be warned, we learned the hard way and am now seeking a lawyer to fight this shady place. Look for somewhere nice, and please ask about management before you move in any where, that's where the problem lies here!!!\n\nUpdate: After dealing with ants, extremely noisy neighbors, numerous phone calls to the police, fights in the parking lot at 3am,  and the apartment managers doing nothing about it, we finally moved my daughter out. BEWARE!!! They are now saying they have purchased from the old owners and no deposits have been transferred over to them. They have $1,000 of our money unaccounted for and won't provide any information. We also were told to not clean the apartment too much as they were going to go in and gut it,  Then we were told they had to spend 2 hours cleaning the kitchen! I cleaned that myself, not my daughter and it was cleaner than when she moved in! Now they say they aren't giving our cleaning deposit back, so there is another $350!!!!! Anyway, telling us they don't have our deposit is illegal, we have spoken with an attorney \n and she told us this is totally illegal, and are looking to begin a class action lawsuit. We welcome anyone else having issues with this apartment complex to contact us. We will be posting on Facebook, Twitter plus handing out flyers and posting in the parking lot of the complex. Strength in numbers people, illegal and shady apartments cannot be allowed to continue behaving like this with no consequences.",

        "review": "After moving into Brampton court my apartment was invaded with ants. Talked to management about the problem and they gave me some ant bait boxes that did not work. I spoke to management a second time and they gave me more bait boxes and said there was nothing else they could do. The second round did not help either. I put up with the ant problem the entire 5 months I was at their location and they just had the oh well attitude and did nothing to remedy the situation. I had a cat and probably threw away about $30.00 worth of cat food due to the ants. I never was more glad to be out of a place. I also spent time cleaning and was charged for little things like dust on the side of a cabinet. I definitely would not recommend this apartment complex.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite the overwhelmingly negative feedback, there are a few positive sentiments regarding Brampton Court Apartments. Some residents have noted the relative safety and convenience of the location. One user mentioned that parking, while occasionally tight, generally allows for finding a spot, which can be crucial in busy times. Additionally, the relatively low noise levels from neighbors were highlighted as a plus, adding to the overall comfort of the living experience.</p><p>Another tenant expressed satisfaction with the management's quick response to maintenance issues, which is a vital factor for many renters. They shared how the experience of living at Brampton Court has improved since their move, arguing that the previous bad reviews may not reflect the current state of affairs. This perspective suggests that experiences may vary widely based on individual circumstances, which is an encouraging note amidst the torrent of negative feedback.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>While the overall experience for many tenants at Brampton Court Apartments has not been favorable, there are a couple of voices that attest to a more positive note. One reviewer emphasized that since moving in, they have had a pleasant experience, appreciating the pet-friendly policies and competitive rates. They also found that noise levels were manageable and felt secure in their living environment, contrasting sharply with several negative accounts from the past.</p><p>This tenant specifically pointed out the rapid response of maintenance teams, which is often a sore spot in property management. This aspect showcases that, for some residents, the management does meet their obligations effectively and manages to create a livable environment, leading to renewed leases and continued occupancy satisfaction from those who have enjoyed their time at the property.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>A significant portion of user reviews reveals a troubling experience for tenants at Brampton Court Apartments. Many complain about inadequate communication from management; users frequently remarked on the difficulty of getting in touch when issues arose or when they had specific concerns. One tenant shared their experience of being unable to connect with staff after paying rent, detailing a sense that management was only responsive during the rent collection period.</p><p>Additionally, the residents have voiced frustrations about maintenance, with numerous complaints regarding unresolved pest problems like ant infestations and noisy neighbors. In one instance, a tenant had persistent ant issues that management failed to adequately address, reflecting poor handling of tenant complaints. The overall sentiment among these reviews underscores a pattern of unresponsiveness and negligence that could contribute to viable tenants' dissatisfaction with their living conditions.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The reviews for Brampton Court Apartments reveal concerning patterns of misconduct and mismanagement. A common thread throughout tenant feedback points to issues with dishonesty, particularly concerning lease terms and security deposits. One tenant described how the management misled them about lease transferability, only to change the terms after the fact, leading to a stark sense of distrust. This has left residents feeling exploited, especially considering the substantial deposits that were reportedly not returned after moving out.</p><p>This dishonesty extended to various complaints about the living conditions, including a lack of emergency measures during extreme weather, overheating apartments, and significant noise levels from neighbors. One user reported a most distressing experience with the management ignoring severe disturbances at night, leading to sleeplessness and general frustration. The compilation of these experiences paints a troubling picture of renter treatment and raises concerns about the overall legitimacy and responsibility of the property management at Brampton Court Apartments.</p></section>"
