        "review": "I am in my third lease term. For the most part, it has been a positive experience. Management is friendly and maintenance needs are usually taken care of quickly.\nMy only real dislikes of living here are how incredibly small the kitchens are, how low end the appliances are, not being allowed to have bird feeders or any hanging flowers, and how ridiculously narrow the parking spots are.",

        "review": "We lived at Barkley for two years, and it was the best apartment experience weve had. Maintenance was always taken care of promptly, the property management team is friendly and helpful, and the neighbors are decent.\n\nBeing able to move in with an alternative to a traditional deposit was very helpful at that time, and upon move out they didnt nickel and dime us for things and were helpful/understanding throughout the move out process. While we were tenants, we were also able to utilize Flex payments and pay rent in two payments, which was very helpful.\n\nThe apartments themselves are nice, and a far cry from the college apartments on the other side of town. Our unit overlooked a green belt on our back side, which was our favorite part. It made it feel like we werent smack in the middle of town, with all of the convenience of being right smack in the middle of town.\n\nIf we ever have to move back into an apartment, I would absolutely want it to be Barkley.",

        "review": "I have been living at Barkley Apartments for going on 4 years! To start the property is absolutely beautiful and well maintained (lawns cut, flower beds rebarked, enough dumpsters to accommodate the number of units). Its really wonderful to step out in the spring and summer to see the azaleas and rhododendrons in bloom.\n\nThe Barkley staff is fantastic as well. Anne and Jessica are so quick to respond via email and they are super approachable if you have to pop in for a quick question. They have been so kind and helpful every time Ive needed to submit a maintenance request. Ive had the craziest last year with a water heater overflow tank springing a leak, my front door handle snapping off, my toilet overflowing and the sink developing a leak but the Barkley team has been there to help me as quickly as possible. They are also so communicative when it comes to community updates like power washing, parking lot repaving, and informing us of third party companies on the property doing other forms of maintenance. If anyone says otherwise, they arent checking their email frequently enough.\n\nAppliances are not super updated but everything works well! Only had to replace toilet water pump, kitchen sink head, and the water tank overflow, but that seemed to be due to general wear and tear from what I could tell. Washer and dryer in unit and still working well! Im happy with my apartment size because its just me but I hope to one day be able to afford a unit with two bedrooms. I love being able to look out my sliding glass door and see green foliage!\n\nIt may be harder to afford rent if you do not have a career and do not have a strict budget, but I do not feel as though they are price gouging, everywhere is expensive, Bellingham is expensive. Such is life.\n\nI also want to comment on the safety of the complex  as some who lives solo just with my companion animals Ive never been afraid in this community and have felt very safe. I love that the complex is pet friendly and very accommodating with waste stations. Being so close to the Barkley Trail system is a dream honestly and my boys and I walk it every single day. I love how close we are to Regal and Haggen and the rest of the Village shops and businesses.\n\nI do wish that my unit didn't have carpet but from what I can tell when residents move out they do renovating and it looks like they are replacing carpets with vinyl flooring, which makes sense.\n\nAll in all if you are looking for a clean, well-kept community with kind and responsive staff, pet friendly and located in one of the best neighborhoods in Bellingham, Id check out Barkley Apartments. I feel very lucky to call this place home.",

        "review": "This place is a total ripoff with management that has no respect for it's tenants. Looking at the lease renewal, if I don't commit to 12 months they charge me 3-4x rent. Extremely predatory and greedy.",
        "owner_response": {
          "text": "We're regret to hear that you're not satisfied with your experience, Beck. Our flexible lease terms allow residents to customize their lease length to fit their needs, unlike a traditional lease where you're locked into a fixed period, allowing you to move out sooner if needed or extend your stay depending on your circumstances. Rates for shorter terms are often higher simply because they are less desirable for us but please reach out to us at 360-647-2818 to discuss any concerns you may have as we are always open to discuss how we can tailor a lease term to your situation. We appreciate your feedback and look forward to the opportunity to talk about this further.\n"

Doesnt help at all. Recommend not going to the managers for any help or not rent here at all. We should be the ones getting good service not being threatened like if we dont pay rent and pay them basically.",

        "review": "I was a long term resident at Barkley Apartments and it was the only place I've rented in Bellingham before I could afford to buy something. The apartments are in a really nice location: near two shopping centers and restaurants on either end of Barkley, an Imax theater across the street, and it's in close proximity to Railroad Trail, which takes you to Bloedel Donovan Park and Whatcom Falls. I felt like my yearly rent increases were fair and reasonable. Maintenance had always been on top of my service requests and was constantly making improvements to the buildings (new roofing, landscaping, dryer vent cleaning, yearly alarm testing, energy-efficient upgrades for lighting, water and thermostats, fixing up and reopening the pool). I feel like management has put a lot of effort into making Barkley Apartments pleasant and welcoming. They have frequent gift giveaways (like free plants and snacks) and host small events for holidays and other things (like a recent celebration of the reopening of the pool and hot tub).",

        "review": "Ive lived here in my rotting apartment for almost 2 years now and have seen no improvement to the complex besides a brand new entryway. Ive had my vehicles broken into/ stolen at least 4 times. Homeless people taking over the dumpsters and office staff that only cares about their own image. The communication between residents is also completely controlled and censored by office staff. Be careful renting here",
