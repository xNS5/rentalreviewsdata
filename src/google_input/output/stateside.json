      "review": "I LIST BOTH POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES BELOW:\nI love this place HOWEVER it has some issues that all come down to staff. The staff is incredibly under trained and when you ask to talk to their boss they are always in a meeting. We had someone who wanted to become our roomate from another unit and stateside staff left us STRANDED. They offered zero help in any way, and while I understand that theres some stuff we had to do ourselves, they refused to help us get help with things that were very important. Weve asked for maintenance before, and it takes forever. They also dig through the recycling so that if you dont bring cardboard to the basement they will read your address off packages and fine you. This doesnt bother me as much but it really bothers my roommates. THAT BEING SAID, I love the building with all my heart view is beautiful. The units are clean and nice. The free coffee bar is awesome and the events are thoughtful (even though they are underwhelming when it comes to food sometimes). I wish they allowed reptiles but I love that its pet friendly, it really makes it feel like a community. Despite the problems I have experienced I signed in for another year because of the building and the people, and chose to try to tough it out when it comes to some of the folks running it. Also theres this INCREDIBLY annoying squeaky fan in the lobby that makes me crave a lobotomy no idea why that hasnt been fixed but it constantly sounds like a bunch of dying birds and makes me not want to hang out in the lobbys which sucks because I LOVE THE SWINGS!!! Overall its a new place, its got some kinks, but at the end of the day I personally find it worth it for what you get to live in, and while VERY expensive (which I think should be less until their service improves but thats wishful thinking) the units are great and I have really mostly enjoyed living here. Hope it improves where I havent totally loved it yet!",

      "review": "Really nice luxury apartments which I have never seen for students before. I stayed here in Summer as a sublet and really enjoyed the location. Good gym and internet amenities.\n\nJust an fyi, dont bother paying premium for Bay facing side, as 1) you dont get much of a view, 2) theres a train that runs pretty much every hour or so and its super load (really LOUD) with its horn blowing the entire time it is crossing downtown (even at 3 AM!), if you are a light sleeper you will not like it.\n\nAn oddity I found in this building was there was no AC in the rooms, theres AC in the hallways and common areas. During summer the rooms really heats up, I remember seeing ~ 88 degrees in the room. So definitely have a fan or may be a portable AC.\n\nAlso, they for some reason charged me a cleaning fee for washroom while I left washroom in nice condition. I had only stayed there for 2 months and I even cleaned up some mess left over by previous people. I didnt bother disputing the charges with them, I might give them a call.",

Washington has a fairly standard \"no AC\" in apartment buildings, but we do apologize if that was a surprise to you and not previously discussed.

      "review": "I cant believe this place has such good reviews. The entire time I lived at Stateside the management was very poorly run and response times were incredibly slow. I was also charged $160 in damages that I did not cause and that Stateside management knows I did not cause. The previous tenant even admitted to causing them and they still charged me for it and were quite rude during communications about it as well. Everyone that I spoke with was clearly undertrained and usually quite vague and unhelpful, ultimately always directing me to write emails where issues were still not resolved. I would look elsewhere if you are a college student looking for housing outside of dorms. Its not worth the trouble of dealing with Statesides management and all the random fees theyll charge you on top of rent!",

As a sub-letter, you'd accepted a unit in \"as-is condition\" which is nominal of foregoing any sort of damage repair, deep cleaning or administrative work that would typically go into readying a unit for a new tenant. What the previous tenant had claimed damage-wise in our outreach to them did not fully encompass the damage present in the unit, leaving those charges to you along with the FMO statement and inspection report with documentation. We'd hate for any of this situation to appear vague or unclear, so if you'd like to visit this conversation with our managers, Genevieve or Lindsay would be happy to discuss over the phone or in-office this week. Thank you again for your review and consideration."

The rent is affordable,The furniture and appliances are nice and modern and the community get togethers they hold are super cool. Such as free spritzer day, free plant day etc. The community areas are always clean and luckily the laundry is free so it helped me cut out extra costs.

      "review": "Great if you have mommys/daddys money. The rent is pretty steep, they charge an outrageous amount for parking in the garage, currently going for $350 each month on top of rent. Street parking is awful and there are times I have to drive around for 30-45 minutes just to find a legal parking spot that isnt over 3 blocks away. Plus my car has been keyed twice. So if having a car is a must, Id recommend going elsewhere.\n\nAs for the apartment itself, its nice, but to get a view of another window and pay $1445 a month for 2 people and a dog in a STUDIO, I think thats a bit much.\n\nThey had amenities listed on their website for over a week after moving in, like providing detergent for washing clothes, that wasnt true. They close the sky lounge at 10, which is rather annoying. They lack cleaning staff and the hallways get filthy, floors sticky, trash left in common areas for days, etc.\n\nThere are homeless people in the ally who, for the most part are peaceful, but the occasional crazy comes by. Theyve left used needles and baggies laying around. Graffiti on the walls that gets left or poorly covered. The flower beds get crazy over grown and left with trash in them. Not a deal breaker but wheres all the money going?? If things get broken like doors or the intercom system, they stay broken for days, in fact the intercom is still MIA and its been over a month.\n\nUpper management is pretty decent, I dont have any complaints about them, lovely people, but some of the lower staff lets just say theyre annoying college kids and when you have questions they either say yeah we dont do/have that or idk so they should definitely do some more vetting/training.\n\nInternet can be dodgy at times, and all the little activities they plan, which make this place seem fun, happen at very inconvenient times for people who have jobs. No one has time at 1:00-2:00 pm on a Tuesday to do anything fun while working a job and going to school.\n\nLast thing, trying to get any insight on what unit Id be in, how big it was, or even what it looked like was impossible. I had no idea until move in day, regardless of how many times I called. So dont expect to know what youre getting into.\n\nOverall, Im not pleased, especially for how much I pay and how little I get back. If youre a rich kid who doesnt have to worry about costs and working a job, good for you, welcome home. For everyone else, Id recommend elsewhere.",

How are you going to tell your residents to leave up their LED lights because your maintenance crew will take them down safely but still charge for the damage that your maintenance crew caused? We have personally removed lots of lights without causing damage!!!\nAlso the maintenance crew came into my daughters private room before her lease was up without her permission!! Her furniture was moved and the LED lights ripped down, at that point she still had at least 5 days left on her lease. How scary is that? Knowing that State Side allows their employees to enter apartments without permission?!?! Parents protect your college students!!!",

Had the opportunity to take a tour in January and walking into the very first unit I fell in love immediately. I signed a lease right after that and I have no regrets. Stateside offers many amenities that other apartments do not. I was amazed at what that offered and how I can know for sure Stateside will be my next home. As far that, Management has been outstanding and always checks up on their residents and their peers among the staff team. By far the best management I have seen by any apartment that are willing to strive for excellence as well as residential needs. If you're looking for your next home. I would highly recommend Stateside as your new home!",

Don't let the two year old photos fool you- the common areas in this place are filthy. Not once in my two years of living here was a main hallway or staircase vacuumed. On top of the filth, this establishment is  will suck every last penny from their residents. Rent is hundreds higher than comparative apartments, and staff will use every excuse to charge you for pre-existing damages/maintenance. I genuinely could not pick out one good part of my living experience here, except the day I got to move out.",

Ive lived in my fair share of homes and apartments, and this one is just about the prettiest. The attention to detail is incredible, they really understand their target audience (students). Soft-close cabinets to keep noise to a minimum when youre doing some late night snacking, fully furnished, and plenty of outlets. Cant wait to move in!!",

      "review": "I can only speak to my experience at Stateside, but from what I have heard from others who I met while living there I can say there is generally some things I can comment on confidently.\n\nFirst and foremost, over the year I lived there Stateside regularly restricted access to some of the amenities as a result of immature behavior from some of the buildings residents. Instead of punishing the people responsible, they restricted access to an amenity (that we all pay for in our lease) and offered no options besides telling us \"too bad\". Despite the outrageously expensive rent, things like washing machines remained broken/unrepaired for 6+ months. The idea that they would increase the rent, while also opting to charge for laundry moving forward contributed to my decision not to live there again.\n\nNow that my lease is up, they hit me with a 200$ charge for things like \"painting\" and \"waste removal\", and even charged me for a key that I returned to the front desk, despite being told by one of their employees it would be taken care of. Move out expenses are typical, but the fact that they charged each one of my roommates $100 for our individual rooms indicates to me that Stateside is just as bad as companies like Hammer and Landmark, fleecing college students and their parents for whatever dollar they can get. I called the leasing office to discuss the charges, only to be ignored and never get a call back.\n\nIf Stateside is going to charge me these vague expenses, the least they could do is give me a call back. Their current approach is \"pay it or we'll send it to collections\".\n\nFor students: Stateside is an upscaled private dorm that isn't close to the \"experience\" they like to market themselves as. If you are paying your own rent (not your parents) this place is way too expensive for what you are getting.\n\nFor parents: This place markets itself as an ideal place for students to live and meet people, but will nickel and dime you at whatever opportunity they can. There are better options, and the neighborhood is also extremely unsafe. Car break in's are common, and there has been multiple shootings (yes, shootings) only 2 blocks away on State st. Buyer beware.",

We want to apologize for the frustrating elements surrounding your experience, namely the closing of amenities while assessing the situations created and the laundry machines being repaired. We are fully functional in both of these areas as of now, and laundry is free as of this lease term. Any questions about move-out charges can be directed to manager@statesidebellingham.com, as we do not dodge conversations about them, we are only able to address complaints in writing and we apologize if that wasn't clear. If there are any questions related to the lease agreement or payment structure, as well as safety/security protocol on site, we are more than happy to discuss them in-office or over the phone. Again, thank you for your full perspective Jared."

Again, we do not wish this situation upon any resident and hope that this will be the last time we have to deal with this together."
