We were comfortable handling the majority of maintenance and repairs on our own,  and they were comfortable being \"hands-off\" landlords. We paid a very reasonable price the entire time that we rented from them.\n\nThey are also good people. I will miss having small chats with Caroline once a month while turning in rent.",

Problems generally get fixed quickly, and they'll be a respectful and attentive landlord as long as you're an attentive tenant.\n\nThey have a reputation for being strict, but I've always been a respectful tenant, and am treated with the same respect.\n\nThey've never played games with nickel-and-diming security deposits, something many other landlords in Bellingham seem to love to do.",

Truthfully Adams is the second worst (Lakeway wins first by a landslide- oi vey). This guy...I've never been so abused by a property management company. Know your renters rights, people! DO NOT let Howard Adams bully you!",
