        "review": "Integra has been managing our condo association for about 3 years.  I am disappointed at their idea of increasing the sales appeal of our units by hiding the costs to new buyers who want to live here.  They are aware that high HOA fees are a deterrence to buyers so they suggest to the board lower HOA fees paired with regular annual assessments to fill the reserve funding.  This seems like bait and switch to me, but our board doesn't see this as an act of deception. \n\nIf you are buying a condo make sure you ask if there have been any recent assessments in addition to the HOA fees which are usually published so you understand the actual cost of living in the unit you are considering.",

        "review": "Our 55+ community in Bellingham had two previous property management companies before Integra. Our HOA Board was very dissatisfied with the previous two companies; and are very satisfied with Integra. Board members have found Integra's broad experience, wide range of tradesmen contacts and overall expertise to be the best they have found. As an owner, I really appreciate the quick responses that Integra provides to all my questions. The two owners (Tess and Cindy) are very competent in a wide variety of circumstances that our community has experienced over the years. It is great being able to rely on them.",

Their rudeness is only exceeded by their questionable ethics. \n\nYou will find better rental and property management companies in the area. These people are the absolute worst.",

I regret that I may have to talk to her again in the future but I can tell you that I will refuse to talk to her. She is definitely a very unhappy person and in the wrong line of work. She tried to belittle me over the phone and that is just not going to happen again. I feel sorry for this company that has this person as their first point of contact.",

        "review": "This is the worst rental management company I have ever had to deal with.  \n\nThey will steal your application fee. They take application fees to apartments they know they will not be renting to you, and refuse to refund you your money.\n\nTheir customer service is terrible. They will not let you know important information. They will not contact you when there is information you should know about your lease. They charge you for every little thing they can, don't give any of your security deposit back, and charge you fines until you have paid an extra $200/month in fees. \n\nThere was no reason for them to treat me this way. I consistently turned in my rent on time, paid all of my bills and was a quiet and respectful tenant. \n\nI can only hope this stops people from using them as a property management company or from renting from them. It is not worth it.",

I wish they could take over the rest of our condo association!!!\nMy admiration of them went up even more recently when they took over and handeled everything for us when our tenants abandoned the unit.

They have no interest in talking with you, getting back to you, providing any kind of information to you, or even thinking about what might benefit your life in the slightest.\n\nTheir office staff is rude and will ignore you if they can. They take months to fix anything you bring to their attention including leaking roofs as well as electrical panels hanging off the side of the building. \n\nThey will never admit when they have made a mistake or mismanaged your property. Instead they will just try to charge you to return things to their original state.\n\nUnsatisfied with this company since day one of dealing with them, its been over a year. Avoid at all costs.",

She just kept saying \"did you read the certificate?\" Yes. I did. It is a legal doc and I just wanted quick clarification because, Hey, Tess, this is your area of expertise, not mine! I think you could do with a course in customer service skills because that is my area and you would be fired! I am buying a condo and can't wait to recommend that Integra be replaced!",

They will take your application fee knowing a listing has already been promised to a different tenant.  It's really akin to theft.  They are rude and unresponsive.  Yuck!  Stay away from this landlord!!!  If I could have given them 0 stars, I would have.",

I wouldn't even give the 1 star if I could. I echo the sentiments exactly of all the other 1 star reviews. I wanna thank these people for leaving these reviews because this company is downright unethical. Terrible service, rude, they will lie and make up stories and do just about anything to get out of taking care of the things they are supposed to take care of. Definitely my worst experience ever with a property management company. You know when so many reviews in a row are one star and all say the same thing you should steer clear. Stay away. Also look at the Google reviews online, same horror stories. I could tell my whole story but just look at all the 1 star reviews before me and you will know my story, exactly the same as what they say. Very dishonest unethical company.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>While the bulk of user reviews for Integra Condominium Association Management tend to paint a negative picture, there are a couple of bright spots worth highlighting. One user mentioned that their 55+ community found Integra to be an improvement over two previous management companies, citing the team's expertise and responsiveness to questions as key strengths. This reflects a positive experience for their community, indicating that some residents appreciate the skills and knowledge that Integra brings to the table.</p><p>Another user expressed admiration for Integra's handling of issues after their tenants abandoned a unit, emphasizing the reliable and exceptional service they received over the years. This positive feedback stands in stark contrast to the majority of reviews, showcasing that under certain circumstances, Integra can indeed rise to the occasion and provide commendable property management.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>User reviews generally reveal a lack of appreciation for Integra\u2019s overall management style, with only a few isolated instances of praise. A notable review highlighted the competence of two owners, Tess and Cindy, who were described as knowledgeable and effective during crises faced by the community. Unfortunately, such experiences appear rare, which suggests that while the potential for greatness is there, it is not consistently met across the board.</p><p>The positive rating given by one user indicates that some clients feel a level of satisfaction with the services rendered, particularly in how quickly the team addresses their concerns. However, these instances seem to be outnumbered by the overwhelming criticism that makes it challenging to paint Auspicious image of the property management company within the wider context of user feedback.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>A significant proportion of user reviews characterize Integra as a problematic property management firm. Frequent complaints revolve around rude staff members and poor communication, highlighted by accounts of unhelpful interactions when inquiries were made. For instance, one reviewer expressed frustration over a worse initial contact experience, where questions were deflected rather than addressed, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction lingering.</p><p>Moreover, multiple users echoed sentiments of heavy-handedness when it comes to fees and charges associated with their properties. Instances of additional costs, non-refundable application fees, and withheld security deposits have resulted in major frustrations, indicating a pattern of management decisions that detract from tenant experience and property value.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The reviews for Integra Condominium Association Management turn quite bleak when examining the overall sentiment expressed by users. Many describe dealing with the company as their \"worst experience,\" stressing how they feel exploited by a management team more interested in profit than in tenant welfare. Comparisons to \"theft\" regarding application fees and eviction from properties without just cause paint a troubling picture of the company's ethical standing.</p><p>Moreover, themes of unaddressed maintenance issues, including leaking roofs and broken electrical fixtures, contributed to a frustrating management dynamic where residents feel neglected. The overwhelming prevalence of one-star reviews and the consistent complaints about rudeness and lack of accountability indicate a systemic problem that makes it clear that prospective clients should approach with caution.</p></section>"
