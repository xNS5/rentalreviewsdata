You repeatedly violated the lease agreement, left your apartment a complete mess and then tried to use photos from someone else's listing to deceive us (something you admitted to doing in your subsequent communication with us). I am happy to provide those records if you now don't recall doing so.\n\nI am sorry that you were clearly unhappy living with us - that is not what we want at all, and we work very hard on resident satisfaction. Our Google reviews, which are much more popular than yelp, show that we have one of the highest ratings in all of Bellingham. But still, that is no excuse to continue to lie and smear our name.\n\nI hope you'll find it in you to update or delete your review in accordance with honesty and integrity.\n\nWe wish you all the best.\n\n-James"

      "review": "Completely dis-organized and could care less about potential customers time.  Called on a property, Tonya said they wouldn't be showing it for a week and a half, gave me a day and time.  Tonya ended up calling me back that evening to advise she gave me the wrong day.\n\nShowed up to the property, with 3 other people and waited 15 minutes.  Finally called to find out it had been rented.\n\nNot only did she/they not call us back to give us the courtesy of not wasting our time, no apologies were made.  She obviously had my name and number.\n\nI will not do business with a company that has such a disregard for people and their time.  I find this rude.  \nA call could have been made at any time that the house had been rented. Mind you, it is still listed on their website.  \n\nFar to many property management companies in this town.  \n\n1 star because they do not offer NEGATIVE STARS option.",

We are much more active on Google reviews, so these few Yelp ones tend to slip through the cracks.\n\nAlso, with this review being so old, I can assure you that management has changed up significantly. I am James, the new manager. Been working here for two years now and have a strong emphasis on resident satisfaction - the aforementioned Google reviews will show that effort to be successful.\n\nWhile I know there's nothing we can do to undo what happened when we were under less effective management, I hope you'll keep a look out for any of our listings again if you should need housing. I promise you won't be disappointed!\n\nHave a wonderful day.\n\n-James"

  "summary": "# Balanced Article on Local Property Management\n\nThis article presents a well-rounded summary of the user reviews for Local Property Management, a property management company located in Bellingham, WA. Aimed to offer a clear perspective on what residents and clients think about their experiences, it's been crafted to aid potential clients in making an informed decision. The intention is clear: to encapsulate the sentiments from actual users without bias, bringing forth a fair account of Local Property Management's service quality.\n\n## Good\n\nLocal Property Management has received appreciation for being tenant-centric, providing a professional rental experience that many find impressive. Many user reviews rave about the company\u2019s responsiveness to issues. From efficient handling of maintenance requests to the ease of reaching and communicating with the management, particularly naming Dawnah as an amenable figure, clients feel well taken care of. These positive interactions are seen as a significant contributor to their above-average review scores.\n\nMoreover, this company is celebrated for its reasonable rental increments and for sometimes not increasing rent at all, which stands out as a generous approach in today's property market. Residents have expressed satisfaction with the overall value for money, noting that the quality of the apartments is commendable when compared to others in the area. The on-site management office and amenities like protected parking add to the convenience and security for the tenants.\n\n## Great\n\nSeveral users have underscored the quality of the properties under the management of Local Property Management, describing their rental units as clean, nice, and of high quality. This underscores the company's commitment to maintaining standards that contribute to a positive living experience. Likewise, the staff's professionalism in interactions paints a picture of a well-run operation where client relations are a top priority.\n\nRenters have gone on a limb to declare Local Property Management as the best in Bellingham, which is a testament to the exceptional service they feel they\u2019ve received. The frequent mentions of promptness and efficiency in every part of the renting process create an image of a company that truly prioritizes tenant satisfaction and strengthens their reputation within the community.\n\n## Bad\n\nDespite the many positive reviews, it's essential to also consider less favorable feedback. One user felt their experience was marred by what they described as 'terrible customer service'. This sentiment was seemingly an anomaly among a sea of praise but is a poignant reminder that consistent service quality can sometimes be challenging to maintain. These incidents suggest that there remain areas where Local Property Management could improve, specifically in ensuring every client's experience is up to the standard that many have come to expect.\n\nAdditionally, the sporadic complaint about communication from the management team, while limited, suggests that there may be rare instances where customers do not feel entirely heard or attended to promptly. Like in any business, there will always be room for growth, and such feedback may help Local Property Management to further refine their services.\n\n## Ugly\n\nAn exceedingly negative review pointed out a scenario where a customer felt scammed, detailing several inconveniences and a dissatisfaction that culminated in a highly charged complaint. The management's response to this review was defensive but also elucidated the discrepancies between the client's claims and the records of their tenancy. Such strong exchanges on public platforms suggest acute dissatisfaction but also reflect the company's willingness to address and dispute such claims openly.\n\nFurthermore, another individual experienced frustration over a miscommunication about property showings and a perceived disregard for customer time. While this review prompted an apology and assurance of improved management, it still acts as a stark reminder of the importance of effective communication and respect for clients' time. In acknowledging this, Local Property Management shows a readiness to make amends and pivot towards better service.\n\nPlease note that the insights provided in this article are generated by ChatGPT, and are intended solely as a tool to aid in the search for a property management company or rental property. These summaries are based on user reviews and reflect a variety of experiences with Local Property Management. As with all services, individual experiences may vary."
