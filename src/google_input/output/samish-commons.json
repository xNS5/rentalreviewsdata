      "review": "The building itself is fine. It's new and rather well insulated. It's fine as low-income housing. However, it's \"tax credit\" rather than subsidized housing. The management can't keep janitorial staff, doesn't communicate well, and generally does not address community concerns. It's so bad around here that they basically tore down and rebuilt the Aloha.",
