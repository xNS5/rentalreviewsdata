They don't seem interested in reimbursing for the $364 tow.",

          "text": "Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry that you have not been pleased with your experience at our community so far. \n\nAlthough occasionally maintenance concerns may arise at any property, our team is committed to responding and communicating quickly to resolve these concerns. The electrical maintenance concerns we experienced have been addressed, and we do not anticipate any further issues. \n\nWe have a number of parking spaces reserved for commercial tenants, and we ask that residents not park in those spaces during business hours out of respect for those tenants. Our team provides warnings before towing, but unfortunately, if a vehicle is not moved, it may result in towing.\n\nWe would be happy to speak with you regarding your concerns. Please give our office a call at your earliest convenience."
