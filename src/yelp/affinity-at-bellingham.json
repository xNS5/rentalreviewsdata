Called management and their response was blame my parents   One week after infestation was found, a terminator is coming. So for one week these people who don't leave their home are living in a bed bug ridden apartment. Neighbors were NOT notified. Bed bugs can multiply from a few to 13,000 in six months. It was a sickening sight and then Affinity's response was appalling!",
