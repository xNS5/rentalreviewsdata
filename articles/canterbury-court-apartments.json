Even being told that the carpet was at life and I would never be charged a carpet fee, this big fat letter came with all of these supposed Invoices from great floors, that there was urine all over the place! My cat does not pee inappropriately. My roommates cat never peed inappropriately. That urine had to have already been there, or its a scam theyve cooked up with Great Floors! They charged me almost the entire deposit to replace the carpet. Man they really saw me coming, what a stupid idiot I am! Do not move in here and do not give them an opportunity to steal almost $3000 from you!\nAs a sidenote, the entire time I lived there I had a horrible deep cough and everyone who lived in the smaller bedroom had an even worse cough. There was something wrong in those apartments. Mold or something is in there. God knows what was in the carpets if they found urine spots all over underneath them!",

Not sure why the ratings are so low but The girls working the front text are super friendly and flexible with any situation.\n\nThe pool, sauna and jacuzzi are a super nice addition, it makes living here worth it!\nI go maybe once or twice a week and have had company over and everyone loved the recreational space to play billiards.\n\nOnly down side is hearing the upstairs neighbors stomp in the middle of the night but nothing a little music cant cover and its my first time living in an apartment so Im just happy to be able to complain about having neighbors.",

After calls, emails and a month of back and forth about false accusations with management, they continued to tell us how horrible we left our home and proceeded to tell us they'd send us to collections after also taking our entire deposit. Take caution with these people as they don't hold back on using lies take away from honest, good tenants. The management should be ashamed of themselves.",

        "review": "Not safely maintained and amenities are not readily available.\n\nPool is constantly closed due to lack of consistent and proper maintenance by the staff, and they won't put a notification on their website or anywhere if it's closed. This means, you won't know it's closed till you're in the building and right at the door, which is very annoying for me as I'm disabled and it would be nice to know if I don't need to aggravate my condition when I need to do hydrotherapy.\n\nThe pool was also closed for years, understandably so during COVID, but they kept it closed for more than a year after while fumbling to install a new HVAC system that got delayed months. Since then, it's been super spotty as it's been closed every time I've tried to visit this past week.\n\nThere's also the issue of the exterior stairs as they're concrete slabs with rebar, and they don't maintain them. In 2019, I fell through one of them as the rebar had completely corroded, and I had to go to the ER. I am now permanently disabled, and got ghosted by the staff when I tried to file an incident report.\n\nMeanwhile, the rent has gone from $950-1650 since 2017 due to numerous reasons (as specified on their notices) from \"market research\" to \"raising of the state minimum wage.\" All the while they've implemented new policies such no longer being able to grill small butane grills on the balcony and forcing residents to get renters insurance when it wasn't required before. We've gained nothing but lost a lot while paying more.\n\nI would move if I could, but this seems to be the norm for property management across the county. The staff are publicly nice, but are still tools to horrible policies.",

        "review": "Don't live here. Price is too high, the pool/spa area is basically a lie, and management is very dishonest.\n\nI lived here for ~2.5 years. In that time, I think I had 5 months of pool access. It was the last pool to open after covid, then they closed it for 6 months for hvac repairs, then it took them another month to 'balance the chemicals'. Literally any excuse they can come up with to keep it closed and keep costs down. The hottub was closed for more than that, and the sauna literally never worked the entire time i lived there.\n\nMaintenance took a full year to replace a part on my stove which was a fire hazard. After they finally did, I could see the part said 'too big' in large letters on it... they knew it didn't fit and used it anyways... TWICE their maintenance guys 'fixed' things in my apartment and ended up damaging my property. They also hid the things they damaged so that they could get out before I noticed.\n\nWhen I moved out, they blamed me for the previous tenant's pet's urine stains. They sent a little map of the stains, most were under furniture that hadn't moved since I moved in. When I asked to see the map from the previous tenant, they stopped responding to my messages. Typical scummy landlord behaviour.\n\nOh and Dear Current Tenants,\nThose obnoxious magnetic extinguishers hanging over your stove? Those aren't up to code. There isn't enough clearance between them and the stove top. Pretty sure you can just take those down if you want. (This from one of their staff.)\n\nA shame really, because the property itself is quite nice.",

The apartments are nice and the maintenance is good and are usually really quick to fix things, but the rent is really high and keeps going up, and they charge for amenities they can hardly even keep up on. My partner and I like to go for swims everyday but they have the pool room closed half the week for maintenance and the clubhouse and gym are so uncomfortably hot its practically unbearable to even use it. Im extremely frustrated that we are paying for extra amenities that we cant even use because theyre either closed half the time or they cant figure out a way to better climate control the main building.

        "review": "Lived in this complex for two years with my SO. We loved it at first, 1295 for a one bedroom one bath on the top floor. The maintenance was usually pretty prompt and we enjoyed the spaciousness of our unit. Over time we noticed a lot of rules enforced by the property managers that were unnecessary. One is that youre not allowed to park backwards in a parking space. Not allowed to have bird feeders? We had one up for over a year before they told us to take it down. It just got ridiculous. Also due to covid they had the clubhouse closed and inaccessible. Once they finally opened it, they were once again strict about unnecessary rules and the clubhouse was always extremely hot and uncomfortable inside.\n\nLastly they have a very non secure process for turning in monthly rent. They told us to slide it through a small crack in the door of the office. We were told this was secure. Our last rent payment they lost our money order and we had to pay an extra 400$. Turns out, it was in their office inside an umbrella the whole time. Though I know thats no ones fault, it feels like there could be a better, more secure system.\n\nAnd they took our entire security deposit and then some.  I suppose this is what you get when you live in an apartment. Take what i say with a grain of salt. The ducks are cute and the pond is very serene.",

State law says you can't smoke on the balconies, and I support that law 1000%. Postmarks on mail returning your deposit money often occur the day after the mail is actually dropped off. Rents in the area are skyrocketing, so they have to raise the rent every year to keep most of the druggies and losers out. If they didn't, the place would be a slum, which it currently is not. All in all, it's been a good place to live, the rent remains fairly priced, the neighbors are decent, and the place is maintained way better than most. Reasonable people with realistic expectations will like the place just fine, and I recommend Canterbury to that kind of renter. I've been satisfied here for more than two years now.",

The grounds are lovely and well kept, with ornamental trees and shrubs. It is surprising how quiet and peaceful it is for it's proximity to the airport.  Management is excellent and there is no waiting whether you need a small repair, or a new appliance. I have not even mentioned the wetland that the apartments are built around, or the winding boardwalk that crosses it, and the ducks who inhabit it. And I have also not mentioned the indoor heated swimming pool, hot tub and sauna, or the well equipped exercise room. It is a great place to live!!",

        "review": "My wife and I lived in this apartment complex for 6+ years. We brought home 2 babies to this home. When we first moved in, the original owners and management were fantastic. We never had a single issue.\n\nFrom my understanding, the apartment complex, or property management company changed hands a few times. The maintenance manager changed jobs, and the grounds went down hill from there. The buildings were not cleaned and maintained on a regular basis. We had to fight to get them to come clean and pressure wash the stairs and hand rails. If an appliance in the apartment broke, it was almost impossible to get them to come fix it. We had birds nests in the outside vents for the bathroom fan, and the dryer exhaust. Our dryer was not drying properly, and had to run it through many cycles to get clothes dry and they just didn't care. They just told us, \"yep, birds build nests every spring...\" If that's the case, why don't you be proactive and plan to clean the vents to prevent that from happening!\n\nRent gets raised every year, and not just 25 or 50 dollars. Our rent one year went from 900.00 to 1075.00 the next year! That is just one example of the raise in rent! They always told us they compared to similar housing and apartments in the area, to justify them raising the rent. Yet we found a place that is 10 years newer and almost 400 sqft bigger, for the same price we were currently paying.\n\nWhen we moved out we spent lots of time cleaning the whole apartment so that we could get our complete deposit back. We knew that there was a deadline for the apartment complex to return our deposit to us, or to provide us with an invoice as to why we would not be getting a deposit back. I waited until the next day (Tuesday) after the deadline to contact them when we had not received anything in the mail. I was informed that it had been mailed out the Friday before, and we should see it in the next day or two. I waited until Thursday, and when we had still not received the deposit, i called them again and they confirmed our new address and said they would check with the accountant and make sure it hadn't been cashed. Seeing as how we were very short on money, from just making the move, I asked them to put a stop payment on the check and issue a new check, and that i would pick it up at the office. They refused to do so, stating that it take 3-4 weeks to issue a stop payment and issue a new check. It doesn't take that long to do all that! My wife decided to call the office and check on it, and they told her it was sent out on Monday. I decided to stop in to the office and talk to them. In the office they told me it was sent out on Monday as well. We ended up seeing the deposit the following day on Friday...WITH A POST MARK STAMP OF TUESDAY(one day after the deadline, two days later then they originally told me, and a day later then what they changed their story to). They also charged us an additional 105.00 for additional cleaning in the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nI would not recommend these living quarters to anyone",
