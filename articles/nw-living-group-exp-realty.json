She and John staged my home extremely well and I had lots of support as I packed up and moved. We found a beautiful home quickly and it was an excellent experience. Mimi was a joy to work with!",

She helped line up a contractor to meet us at a showing and even played with our toddler was we viewed another home. She found us the perfect home in the neighborhood we wanted. Sally has a wonderful crew and got our house ready for the market. She got our first bid on our house in three days. She helped us along each step of the way. I highly recommend her and would use her again in the future.",

Sally Farrell was not only our eyes, ears and nose, she was always one step ahead and guided us through the entire process with little to no stress. I loved how she wasn't afraid to tell us the negatives of a property before trying to sell us on it. Talk about integrity! She provided us with 360 videos of the properties we were interested in and even videoed the streets and neighborhoods. Sally's experience shows and we would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a trust worthy advocate and great negotiator.",

She not only knows the business, but goes above and beyond for clients.  When the weather suddenly turned cold, she went over to the condo to turn the heat on and to take care of other details to weather proof the unit. She took care of many other small details that would have been a headache for us to deal with as out of towners.  She was always prompt and positive with responses to questions and every interaction with her was pleasant and positive.  She enjoys her job and it shows by the care she gives her clients.",

        "review": "Honestly, our family would NOT have been able to find a home without Sally Farrell at Northwest Living (Exp Realty). Not only is she a wonderful human being, she is a highly skilled professional with great intuition. Sally helped us discern what we wanted/needed, and guided us in finding a home in our price range that would suit the needs of our family...in Bellingham of all places where the market is SO crazy.  Once we found a home, Sally worked tirelessly to make sure EVERYTHING was on track and arranged for a myriad of inspections, estimates and repairs to be done before we closed. I have no idea how she was able to do it all except for the fact she might actually be  Wonder Woman incognito. If you are looking to buy a home, you will be beyond pleased and impressed working with Sally Farrell (and her entire team...esp awesome Diana Burgeon who helped us immensely while Sally was out of town).",

During the short time we did have in Bellingham, we felt Mimi and her team were willing to go above and beyond to set up showings and flex with our wild ideas and crammed schedule. She humbly helped us to understand the contracts and jargon of the industry, despite her decades of expertise. Even when we stumbled upon unsavory challenges, we felt Mimi was our biggest supporter and advocate to the extent of her ability (and then a bit further). We will forever be grateful for the serendipity that brought her and her team into our home buying experience and lives.",
