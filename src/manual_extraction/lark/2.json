They draw you in with fancy amenities, spacious rooms, their location being close to the WWU campus, etc. That's all a façade for how horrible this company is at managing a so-called student living complex.\n\nLet me start off that when I moved in, I put in a roommate application saying I would prefer to live with someone who is female and generally keeps themselves and their living environment clean. What did Lark match me with? The exact opposite. They assigned me a male roommate, when I explicitly said that I only wanted to live with females and living with a male would make me uncomfortable. My male roommate was also extremely unhygienic and incompetent, since he didn't seem to know how to pick up a broom and sweep the floor.\n\nWhen I first moved in, he was already living there for a year prior. The place stunk with a foul stench, the kitchen was horrendously dirty, and the floors were unable to walk on barefoot due to how much grime was covering the floor. When I arrived at my bedroom space, the toilet was covered in dried up urine, the carpets weren't vacuumed and I didn't even have a screen installed to my window. I thought to myself, this is what I'm paying close to $900 for each month? In this kind of living condition? And Lark didn't even do anything about it.\n\nAlso they invade your space every week or so, emailing you that they'll be doing some sort of \"maintenance\" that involves trespassing into your apartment. Also, if no one is home, they'll just barge in anyways. Isn't that illegal or something for landlords to enter into your place without your permission? Whatever.\n\nGood luck trying to break your lease if you don't want to pay upwards of $2,500 to mitigate the loss on their end. For a place that calls themselves student living, they're not very accommodating to their own residents, whom they know are college aged and have issues pertaining to life circumstances, ESPECIALLY during COVID-19 where students would rather live with their families instead of their disgusting roommates.\n\nMy roommate left me with a giant mess to clean up on my own. The absolute worst experience with a roommate I've ever had--and that's on Lark for assigning him to me.\n\nI didn't have an issue with parking spaces as I always had a spot close to my building, but that's probably due to not enough people living inside the units. I've walked past several ground floor units where the bedrooms are not occupied, which tells me they're struggling to find gullible students to fill in the spots.\n\nLark is so desperate for new residents that they've contacted people on instagram via direct messages that have \"WWU\" in their bio and ask if they're interested in signing a lease with them. They've also emailed residents and offered free items, food and accommodations to those who leave good reviews on google. How disingenuous and pathetic.\n\nDon't forget the absolute ridiculous astounding charges they slap you with after you move out--either pay those soon or they'll send you to collections! I left my apartment cleaner than when I moved in and they still charged me over a whopping $250 for a \"deep clean of the kitchen & living room\" even though I cleaned that place spotless before I moved out.\n\nThey also charged me well over $150 to \"repaint\" all the holes from tacks in the walls even though I had hung up one poster and the rest of it was already there from the previous tenant. All Lark does is charge their residents for maintenance, cleaning, and repairs and then don't actually repair or clean the place at all. They just pocket the money.\n\nThe only good thing about Lark is the student-led staff in their main office--they're somewhat kind and accommodating to your questions and concerns, but the other managers are a nightmare.\n\nDO NOT live here--even if it's your last choice. Just like everyone else who left a nasty review, this place deserves ZERO stars. Avoid this place like the plague, or reap the consequences.","language":"en","__typename":"ReviewText"},"rating":1,"feedback":{"coolCount":0,"funnyCount":1,"usefulCount":3,"loggedInUserVotedCool":false,"loggedInUserVotedFunny":false,"loggedInUserVotedUseful":false,"msiteSubmitFeedbackCsrfToken":"3a525a1df755fed0d9c963b8a21d34f70ae96c4f3ce7399b69de97726935ca15","__typename":"ReviewFeedback"},"author":{"encid":"MlGUVQcmum5KLQ-ypIzMpg","isFollowedByLoggedInUser":false,"profilePhoto":{"encid":"TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag","photoUrl":{"mediaItemSrcUrl":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag/30s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag/60s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag/90s.jpg","__typename":"UserPhotoUrl","userSrc":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag/60s.jpg","userSrcSet200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag/120s.jpg","userSrcSet300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TNU51hY9kbTnvZunaol8ag/180s.jpg"},"__typename":"UserProfilePhoto"},"displayName":"Jennie

I'm not surprised at all that very little has changed.\n\nLet me just start by saying Lark Bellingham totally takes advantage of college students. The marketing is aggressive, they prey on you through social media (AND I was even told that they use social media to match roommates together - which is completely unethical). The system of renting through individual leases is just one of the many loopholes this place uses to abuse tenant's rights and unfortunately, many college students are just trying to get their first place on their own so we fall victim to it.\n\nMy first year here parking was a nightmare. I would get home late from work and have to park at Fred Meyer when it was very dark outside and walk over because there wasn't a single spot available. This is how they get you to pay the extra $40 a month for a Reserved spot. I witnessed so many college students get towed for parking at their own apartment complex. This year, I gave in on paying for a spot only to have nothing enforced and lots of parking available since there were so many vacancies during the pandemic. I could have saved thousands of dollars on this pass. \n\nThe \"security\" does not exist. Wait... let me correct myself. They do exist, but they sleep on the job and can't actually respond to calls about safety. Yes, I witnessed a security guard sleeping in their car last year after cars were broken into. \n\nThere was a good month and a half where my packages would continually \"go missing\" since they are delivered to the office and not straight to our door. The old manager here tried to convince me I was lying and then 2 weeks later my package magically reappeared. \n\nWhen it came to having roommates on this individual-lease system, I got completely screwed over. My old roommate worked for the complex and told me many times that she would be the one picking my roommates for this year, told us that she memorized our phone numbers, and would speak poorly of other staff members and residents while in our unit. I ended up being alone this year after I raised concerns about my safety given that my privacy was violated, but now only 4 weeks from me finally moving out of this place, I received 6 days notice that I would be getting a roommate and only 17 hours notice that someone would be entering my apartment the following day. The staff was nice enough to follow the law and wait until 24 hours+ to enter after I raised my concerns, but did nothing about giving me very little time to make arrangements for the person moving in with me. \n\nThe new staff members are very kind and try their best to be helpful, but it seems like they don't really have the right training to provide guidance to residents. I feel bad for them because it really isn't their fault, but it's also difficult to be paying $800+ to live here and not have great resources when it comes to the leases and issues with the space.\n\nAlso, be aware if you move here that the power seems to go out more than anywhere else I've ever lived. So stock up with flashlights and portable chargers. \n\nOh, and they bribed residents with pizza if they left a good review for them on Google.\n\nI will also add that all the responses from Scion seem to just be trying to delegitimize the negative experiences shared by other residents.","language":"en","__typename":"ReviewText"},"rating":1,"feedback":{"coolCount":0,"funnyCount":0,"usefulCount":3,"loggedInUserVotedCool":false,"loggedInUserVotedFunny":false,"loggedInUserVotedUseful":false,"msiteSubmitFeedbackCsrfToken":"c1c3bf09a62d748ef8c1f00c188e1d1f9e5a8ed50be7f122fb161e7d0688ea52","__typename":"ReviewFeedback"},"author":{"encid":"zKh10gqnmt6jzJFU3u29TA","isFollowedByLoggedInUser":false,"profilePhoto":{"encid":"i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA","photoUrl":{"mediaItemSrcUrl":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA/30s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA/60s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA/90s.jpg","__typename":"UserPhotoUrl","userSrc":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA/60s.jpg","userSrcSet200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA/120s.jpg","userSrcSet300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i6nhbpVe5rI8gbFjRTmwVA/180s.jpg"},"__typename":"UserProfilePhoto"},"displayName":"Holly

I have emailed Scion to clear this up. Haven't heard back from them at all. My roommate has also been trying to pay for damages and get some disputes resolved for a month now and has yet to have them resolved, which has prevented us from finding a new place to live. \n\nI lived here for two years. During that time, the office staff was transphobic, incompetent, and rude. They often misgendered my husband and called him by the wrong name, even after multiple attempts to correct them. One of the staff there, Selena, was particularly malicious and seemed to make it her personal mission to make our living experience there terrible. Throughout our every experience with her, she never once showed my husband any ounce of respect in his gender identity. Keep in mind, he goes by his middle name. It is LEGALLY his name. There is no excuse for their dismissiveness on our request that he be called by the correct name.\n\nOnce, he ordered something online and though he knew it was there, office staff insisted it wasn't. He had ordered same sized products from the same company before. They were always only delivered to the office. The staff, moments later, SHOVED into our open mailbox for us to collect.\n\nThe printer in the computer room was known for not working very often. The computers sometimes didn't work either. \n\nWe were once accused of not picking up after our dog, the official story being that someone tried calling after my husband to get him to clean up, but that my husband ignored them. Not only did nobody ever talk to him about his dog, but it wasn't even our dog. He was our roommate's dog, so they should have contacted her. Not him.\n\nThe outdoor amenities weren't what we expected. The hammocks were sometimes broken or missing. We found a few times that the grills were left on at night leaking propane. At one point, the fire pits wouldn't even turn on and I have no idea if that ever got fixed.\n\nDog trash cans were frequently overflowing and empty of any bags, sometimes left that way for weeks. \n\nThe dumpsters tended to overflow too, piles of trash and recycling so high you couldn't even get through. \n\nThe quarterly inspections were often unorganized and sometimes rescheduled to the day after they were supposed to have been done, which was incredibly inconvenient for us. \n\nDuring one of the inspections, they had trouble opening my bedroom door. I told them of they just lift the handle up instead of pushing it down, it opens just fine. A few days later, unbeknownst to us, maintenance came by because they were scheduled to fix it. After the inconvenience of the late inspection, the unwanted and spontaneous presence of maintenance was especially frustrating. \n\nAnother inspection happened on Halloween. I had to cancel my plans. My pets don't deal well with strangers coming into our home and I didn't like the idea of them entering unsupervised. So, with my plans canceled, we waited around for hours. I kept calling throughout the day, getting a different estimated time of when they would be getting to my building. No one seemed to be certain or even know what building they were currently working on. By the end of the day, NO ONE EVEN SHOWED UP. I called the manager and left an angry voicemail. The next day, I get a call back with the manager saying that they simply ran out of time, something I already knew because that was blatantly obvious. The worst part of it was that I didn't get an apology. The call was just a condescending excuse for them not doing their job correctly and having little consideration for their tenants.\n\nWhen we worked late, there was often no parking at all. We frequently had to park at the Fred Meyer parking lot. They advertise \"free parking\" but don't have enough parking spaces for everyone, so that's completely misleading. Even people who pay for RESERVED parking can't find spots at the end of the night!\n\nThere was a hole in the fence that led out to the Fred Meyer parking lot. It was continuously broken open again whenever it was repaired. The smart thing to do would be to put a gate there. (But it's Lark. They aren't exactly smart.) It's the least they can do for the people who aren't able to actually PARK in the Lark parking lot and have to walk around the fence in the middle of the night just to get home. But whatever. Keep wasting money replacing it, I guess. \n\nThey call themselves \"luxury apartments,\" but don't bother to even put backsplash in the kitchen or proper insulation in their walls. You can hear everything your neighbor does and the entire apartment is freezing during the winter.\n\nThis is by far the worst, most poorly managed place I've ever lived. Do not live here. Believe me, you'll regret it.","language":"en","__typename":"ReviewText"},"rating":1,"feedback":{"coolCount":0,"funnyCount":0,"usefulCount":7,"loggedInUserVotedCool":false,"loggedInUserVotedFunny":false,"loggedInUserVotedUseful":false,"msiteSubmitFeedbackCsrfToken":"284568d7b2b4a5ce196359dd2e92a95ee4c0754d3d57dfad9e01de02c9955ecb","__typename":"ReviewFeedback"},"author":{"encid":"Ooa_SpOOnf1ch8nlmoS8gQ","isFollowedByLoggedInUser":false,"profilePhoto":{"encid":"dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw","photoUrl":{"mediaItemSrcUrl":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw/30s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw/60s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw/90s.jpg","__typename":"UserPhotoUrl","userSrc":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw/60s.jpg","userSrcSet200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw/120s.jpg","userSrcSet300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dMznIQ1vkZGOvXaWbvXXRw/180s.jpg"},"__typename":"UserProfilePhoto"},"displayName":"Casea

I can honestly say this is one of, if not the worst places I've ever lived. I have waited a full year before writing this review so that my anger could subside and I could be concise, but this is still a lot. The prices are insane, and they are very aggressive in forcing you to sign and resign your lease. Our lease started in September and by October they were already egging us on to signing another year. So, we did, because we didn't want the prices to go up...what a mistake that was. \n\nWe all ended up moving out early because of the pandemic. But before that, we witnessed so many things that made none of us want to return. \n\nThe people who lived above us would constantly have parties late into the night, sometimes as late as 4 or 5am on a weekday. Blaring music and the sounds of moving tables, beer pong, and fireworks were just some of the noises. We would call security and nobody would pick up, or nothing would happen. Parking was also a nightmare, we bought reserved spots but even then if you came home after 5pm it was nearly impossible to find a spot (this was before the pandemic). The shuttle is an absolute joke- you would not only have to wait in line (most of the time in the rain because it's Washington) but there were hardly ever enough seats. It also would be shut down randomly so you'd have to find another form of transportation to get on campus, which normally is fine, except for the fact that the shuttle is advertised as a main selling point for the complex. The dumpsters were always overflowing and never seemed to be emptied. All of the amenities were a sham.\n\nThe other thing that was always incredibly frustrating was the front desk. I get it, college students need jobs; but they were never trained well and could never answer any questions you would have as a tenant- they were trained to get people to sign leases. That's it. \n\nAll in all, I urge you, do not get stuck in the trap that is this place. Their leases prey on innocent young students just trying to find a place to live.","language":"en","__typename":"ReviewText"},"rating":1,"feedback":{"coolCount":0,"funnyCount":0,"usefulCount":2,"loggedInUserVotedCool":false,"loggedInUserVotedFunny":false,"loggedInUserVotedUseful":false,"msiteSubmitFeedbackCsrfToken":"b2ea1d28be496fce8b6551e585f51cf6c9f21fc711e443acaf05d60251b9ca75","__typename":"ReviewFeedback"},"author":{"encid":"w4eIYApblleVfYLLd5vzXw","isFollowedByLoggedInUser":false,"profilePhoto":{"encid":"hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og","photoUrl":{"mediaItemSrcUrl":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og/30s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og/60s.jpg","mediaItemSrcSetUrl300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og/90s.jpg","__typename":"UserPhotoUrl","userSrc":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og/60s.jpg","userSrcSet200x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og/120s.jpg","userSrcSet300x":"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hDEwmsmmqRbyM-V-eKW6og/180s.jpg"},"__typename":"UserProfilePhoto"},"displayName":"Emily
