        "review": "If I could give a 0 I would. The new owners are supposedly a non profit and these are income restricted. So why, in a single increase, was my rent raised by $890!? There is mold everywhere from previous water damage that I wasnt told about. They have garages you can rent. But the terms change based on if management likes you or not. They took mine back for complaints made about things management had told me were fine. When talking to other staff about the complaints I was told those werent the reasons and they wouldnt say more. I wasnt allowed to defend against bogus complaints. I had witnesses and proof but was told by management I dont want to hear it. Visitor parking is almost nonexistent. The few spots there are are only at the front of the complex and residents park their own cars there. Rules and policies are  enforced unfairly depending on whether management likes you or not. Save yourself the headache and find somewhere better. For the rent they charge it isnt worth it.",

The place has been relatively quiet, safe with a good sense of community. At this complex  a tenant may enjoy a, quiet friendly environment, a clubhouse with a gym, laundry, tv room, sauna and heated swimming pool;.   The staff has been keeping the place clean and has been doing an excellent job balancing things during the recent lockdowns.  The apartments are spacious and well maintained.  I have never waited more than one day to have something fixed.  Could use some more blue recycling bins and more guest parking that the existing tenants do not monopolize.",

This is 100% immoral and false advertising. Please if you were reading this and live in these apartments do not post a false review. The only reason that this place wants five star reviews so they can raise the rent come 2021 or get more money from the government as subsidize housing. Either way this is wrong. If you are worth the review that Evergreen Ridge Apartments is bribing it's tenants with, then you wouldn't need to ask. This is exactly why nobody can trust online reviews.",

Within a month I was being physically  threatened  and it wasn't a safe environment  for me or my puppy. The management knew the situation, but still wouldn't let me cut my lease for another month to get away from my roomate. I had to leave for my safety and the move out fee  (After my roomate got evicted) came out to 1,500 that I have to pay for the month that I didn't even live  there, all they care about is taking your money! And Not to mention the extra charges due  to damage she did to the apartment after I left, and that she stole all my furniture. 2000 all together  for the one month living there in a sketchy  area. Definitely  not worth it highly recommend finding another place",

If you mind your own business, take care of your space, and are respectful, you won't have problems. I don't know what  people are whining about.  If you're difficult, others will give you a hard time. Try kindness and respect. You'll get a much different response.",
