# Follis Realty LLC: A Balanced Look at a Local Property Management Company

**Good:**

Follis Realty LLC has been garnering positive attention through its property management services. One user review praised the company, giving it a perfect rating and extolling its virtues as a property manager. The reviewer was ecstatic, awarding them more than the standard five stars, and stating, "Follis Realty is my property manager and they couldn't be any better!! 5+ stars." It appears that their experience with Follis Realty LLC was nothing short of excellent, suggesting that the company has made significant efforts to stand out in the field of property management.

Adding to the good reputation, the limited number of reviews available for Follis Realty LLC show an impressive average review score. With the users of their service seeming to be pleased, it's clear that Follis Realty LLC has, in at least some instances, built a foundation of trust with their clients. This consistent positive feedback, although based on a small sample, indicates that many might find their property management services satisfactory.

**Great:**

Digging deeper into the positive aspects, customer satisfaction seems to be a priority for Follis Realty LLC. The absence of negative comments about communication or management indicates that they might have established reliable avenues for their tenants and property owners to reach out and resolve issues. An observed theme of responsiveness to tenants' needs could be a strong suit, with the reviewer’s enthusiastic approach highlighting Follis Realty LLC’s potential for excellent service delivery.

Moreover, the high average rating of Follis Realty LLC points towards them potentially exceeding expectations rather than solely meeting them. If the property management company has continually shown diligence and commitment to their clients, it's plausible that they are setting a standard for what excellent property management looks like. Positive experiences often lead to word-of-mouth recommendations, which could explain the five-star average on user reviews for this company.

**Bad:**

Despite the glowing reviews, it is crucial to remain objective and consider the downsides of such a small review pool. With only two user reviews available, one with no written feedback, the data is not robust enough to give a well-rounded evaluation of Follis Realty LLC. This limited feedback does not lend itself to identifying any ongoing or consistent issues, such as neglecting maintenance concerns or mishandling security deposits, common complaints in the property management sector.

Furthermore, the lack of negative reviews precludes prospective tenants or property owners from understanding the potential challenges they may encounter with Follis Realty LLC. Without constructive criticism or reports of bad experiences, one might question the completeness of the available user reviews. The absence of varied feedback may leave future clients without a clear picture of the hurdles they might face when engaging with the company.

**Ugly:**

In terms of the “ugly” aspects, currently, there are no alarming red flags raised by user reviews for Follis Realty LLC. However, it’s important to note that poor communication and negligence are often the most egregious faults attributed to property management companies in general. Should such concerns be present but unreported due to the scarcity of reviews, potential clients could inadvertently step into less-than-ideal situations.

It also remains unseen how Follis Realty LLC handles criticism or negative feedback, as there have been no recorded instances of the company replying to user reviews. This lack of interaction with reviewers doesn't provide any insight into how they may handle conflict resolution or customer dissatisfaction. It's a critical aspect for any property management company to address concerns promptly and effectively, and this absence leaves questions about their customer service approach unresolved.
