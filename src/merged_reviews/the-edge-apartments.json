The cost to \"paint\" and \"clean\" (i.e., the things they don't have to itemize because it's labor) will be expensive. I lived there for 7 years and they didn't even replace the carpet after I moved out--it wasn't new when I moved in, either!",

The apartments and appliances are well taken care of, there is little parking, but it hasn't been a problem for me. There is available parking 1 block away. The staff and manager are always friendly and helpful.",

Youd think for how much they charge on rent it wouldnt be an issue for maintenance fixes but thats clearly not the case. The landlord has an attitude and is not prompt about updates or handling requests for maintenance. Rent through Son-Rise and dont waste your time or money living here.",
