## The Bad

Not all user reviews of Access Real Estate Services are glowing. Several users have reported frustrating interactions with the company, including instances of what they describe as poor customer service and a lack of empathy for tenants' situations. Concerns about rude behavior when addressing questions or maintenance requests have been raised, suggesting a notable deficiency in the company’s client support at times. Additionally, concerns about the company's competence have surfaced, with certain customers reporting erroneous charges and advising others to verify all invoicing details.

It's not unusual for issues to arise in property management, but consistent themes of dissatisfaction in areas such as communication, particularly on weekends, raise concerns about the company’s availability to address problems when they occur. For some, the company's management of maintenance and inspection procedures was lacking, leading to friction and a sense of abandonment by those they serve.

## The Ugly

Unfortunately, the reviews reveal some significantly troubling patterns. There are numerous accounts of tenants feeling taken advantage of, with allegations of unethical charges and failure to return security deposits without justification. In one particularly scathing review, a former tenant described the company as engaging in "sneaky" practices to levy fees and displaying blatant disregard for outreach efforts when questioned about these charges.

Stories of neglected repair requests and charges for damages that were pre-existing upon moving in have surfaced. Some tenants accuse the company of targeting inexperienced renters, such as college students, by imposing excessive move-out fees and fines. Although these reviews represent only a fraction of the user reviews, the gravity of the accusations necessitates serious consideration by potential clients.

In summary, while Access Real Estate Services has been commended by some for exemplary service, they also face allegations of negligence and unethical conduct that overshadow the positive aspects.
