        "review": "I had a wonderful experience renting with Village apartments 2022-2023. If I was back in town and could get in a two bedroom unit, I would jump on it. I was absolutely hesitant with the Google reviews that mentioned a terrible property manager- but thank God for turnover because we had an excellent experience with Morgan (new PM). She was confident, helpful, kind, and knowledgeable. She treated all tenants with respect, loves pets, and was so amazing",

        "review": "Firstly, the property manager Morgan is amazing. I was thrown off by some of the reviews for the previous property manager... but Morgan is CHEFS KISS fantastic. She's responsive, personable, and goes above and beyond if you encounter any issues. Just the best person to deal with.\n\nMy cat and I moved here when I needed to downsize. The 1br/1bth is small, but I've made it work. You'll definitely need to buy furniture that doubles as storage as storage space is very limited. Neighbors are very respectful about the parking spaces and everyone parks in the same spots... so you're never struggling trying to find parking.\n\nI would recommend purchasing a dehumidifier to use during the spring/summer months to kick the moisture issue.\n\nIf you're looking for a fancy place... this isn't it. But it's comfortable and I've made it cozy. So there's that!",

        "review": "New manager Morgan is amazing. All previous reviews were due to bad manager previous to Morgan. Trust me! I lived here for three years. Former manager Charlene was not a great fit for the apartments. She was very difficult and not a great charmer.\nLook, this place isnt perfect. If you are looking for basic, no thrills, no special treatment. This is your place. Pay your rent on time, follow the rules and communicate with Morgan, she is great. If you do this, this place will be a good home.",

        "review": "Moldy, cheap, slow response to repair requests, and worst of all: property manager is neurotic and one of the strangest and most aggressive people I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.\nShe seems to have little to no supervision and does what she wants. She will not send you statements or receipts for anything you pay for. She will not mail you your security deposit. She will not share the owners contact information because she does not want to be in trouble. As soon as you ask for proof of anything, for information, or for any updates about repairs or charges or anything -  she will shut down and be completely uncooperative and combative.\n\nShe will enter your apartment unannounced and while you are not home. She will walk around the back of the properties and peep through windows if you leave the curtains open.\n\nYou wont get your money back and she wont return calls from new landlords checking on rental history. Her office is like a black hole where your receipts, money, and paperwork disappear. Just avoid this place.",

        "review": "Be very careful renting here. Small apartments, high rent, rude landlord. You have to ask a hundred times to have anything fixed and even than they will clam you are harassing them. My elderly mom lives here. The landlord has harassed, me her son, for visiting, and even worse tried to say she is not allowed to babysit her grandson. My mom is an excellent renter, she keeps everything clean and neat, pays rent on time, but because she is on housing and elderly they will be rude to her even to her face .Currently trying to get her out of here, renter be warned.",

No parking controls, some people have multiple vehicles and if anyone has guests there may be no parking for you when you come home.  Its been 2 months since my move out and I still haven't received a refund or accounting of my deposit.\nI will live in my car before I ever move back into a Speck property  ....",
