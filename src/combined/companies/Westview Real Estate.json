      "review": "I lived at the Shearwater for 4 years.  The apartment is a great place to live, very convenient location, with parking lot and in-unit laundry, which are both rare in a downtown facility.\nHowever, the management staff were problematic.  The building common spaces were dirty most of the time, the parking lot was never cleared of snow, the security gates often didn't close fully.  \nThe staff consisted of a claque of rude young individuals who seemed more interested in their social lives other than customer service.  Using Covid as an excuse, they kept their business doors locked and maintained short hours well after restrictions were listed.  If one had a regular job and needed some help after 4:30 in the afternoon, well too bad! I returned from a 3 week trip to find that my building key didn't work, they had changed the locks.  Luckily, I got into town early   that day so could get into their office door (not the office, just a crack in the door) and was given the new key. When asked what I would have done if I had gotten there half hour later, the reply was, \"We emailed you that you needed a new key\"  That did not answer my question, and when I searched all my email, plus spam, there was no email\nDuring the rent control, they insisted that they would demand their proposed back rent to be paid as soon as the rent control was lifted, so I should pay their rate even if I wasn't legally required.\nThe rules regarding the lease were rigid.  One had to notify them over 3 months in advance if you were going to renew, which was difficult in my work situation.  If you didn't tell them by that date, they threatened to rent the apartment out from under you.  When I finally retired and moved, the process of finding someone to take over my lease was bureaucratic, cumbersome, and inflexible, with tons of paperwork, and difficult for both myself and the individual taking over my lease. Plus they wanted me to sign documents which would imply I was still responsible for the next year's lease renewal, or so it sounded from what they were seemingly saying. This was at a time when there was a huge demand for rentals downtown, and they even refused to list my unit on their website as being available for rent.  \nIn summary, great apartment, lousy service",

      "review": "A sprinkler bursted at an apartment complex (broadway apartments) the customer service has been terrible. The way that the workers talk to people about situations and their frustrations is so wrong, if you work in customer service act like it. For example a very important email about everything that happens was supposed to get sent but that didn't happen so the next day we called and a woman answered and just said \"oh I forgot to send it.\" Mind you she was so rude and dismissive about everything. Saying \" it's not any new information you don't already know.\" Completely unprofessional. Expecting everybody to move right now like we have places to go automatically. It's a whole apartment complex don't expect everybody to have a place to go this could be their only option so why don't you guys try to be more sensitive about that. With that being said y'all need to get your words straight, saying we can get our rent and deposits back if we move, like you have to give us that anyways because we have to leave with causes that was not created by us. I get that you need to fix this problem but its not like it's not livable. People need time to figure stuff out. Think about the families. Or people that live paycheck to paycheck you think they can just move without their deposit back and getting rent back because you usually needs first months rent right? Sucks for people that don't have the money. Where they gonna go? The street? Right, you can't help us find housing. Oh don't get me started in maintenance. Still waiting for the second shower rod to get fixed and moved in august and now it's January. Had to fight to even get the blinds fixed in the front window of the apartment where everyone can just look in. Listen do not ever go with Westview. 10/10 do not recommend!",

      "review": "We are currently residing in Los Angeles and have lived in Bellingham for years prior to moving down here. We are in the process of moving back and have been searching for housing in the area. We decided to place an application with their new property, The Weatherby.\n\nOur correspondences were with an agent named, Kim Seitz. Her lack of follow through and poor customer service during the process resulted in our decision to withdraw our application.\n\nWe had placed and application on their site this past weekend. We followed up with a call and spoke directly to Kim on Monday. We had requested availability of a 1 or 2 bedroom and she stated she would send us pictures through e-mail of a few units that were available later in the afternoon. She did not follow through, so we called again on Tuesday and left a message requesting to see pictures/floorpans of any available 1/2 bedrooms. Again, there was no follow through. We called on Wednesday, Kim answered and we asked her about the status of our application and if she could send us pics/floorplans of the 1/2 bedrooms as she shared she would earlier in the week. \n\nShe responded with a flat: \"I cannot move the process forward until the roommate places an application\". (We had no problem doing so as we both have rented and know this is standard procedure as far as being approved, but many places actually will send a notice or the agent will contact the primary applicant and tell them how to proceed for the \"roommate\". We were waiting to hear from the agent to know how to move forward as the primary was going to be fully rent responsible & able to afford place on his own while the roommate is on disability. We were unsure how to \"link\" the applications in the system.)\n\nThere was an awkward silence and I shared we could certainly fill out the application, but are you now saying that we can't see pictures of the 1/2 bedrooms that you stated earlier that you would send? She then shared she had been too busy and that she was there alone, etc. Keep in mind we had already placed $100 application fee. We could see on Craigslist that they only had 1  1 bedroom left, etc. and were growing concerned about availability. \n\nAt this point, we hung up quickly as we did not appreciate the lack of follow through, excuses, and frankly, the \"attitude\" displayed when we had waited patiently for pictures that she said she would send 2 days earlier. This apartment would have been $20,000-26,000 for a year lease that we were willing to commit to had we signed with them.  \n\nWe wrote later stating that we were canceling the application. She continued to send a message about the 1 bedroom the following morning. We were potentially going to reconsider and \"just let things drop\" and we asked how much it would be as she did not include pricing for the unit. She then responded with the message below which showed quite a bit of immaturity, bringing up the conflict that was actually brought about by her lack of follow through initially and also not following up to explain how to link applications, etc. Most places we've rented the primary fills out the application first and then the roomate. Etc.\n\nAnd so, based on the lack of follow through, incompetence, immaturity, and unprofessionalism we decided to look elsewhere. I sincerely hope the property management company provides better training as moving is already extremely stressful and we didn't want the added stress of signing a lease with an agent who we didn't feel we could rely on to get back to us. And, one who made us feel uncomfortable in the process.  \n\nWhy bother with a place that shows you UP FRONT that your business does not matter to them???  Thanks, but, UM, NO THANKS.",

      "review": "It was a rough year living in this apartment complex, and the turmoil did not end when we moved out. Some of our concerns are outside of the direct control of the management company, but most are not.\n\nFirst, it is a loud place to live. We started on one side of the complex, and could rarely get a good night's sleep with the noise from both inside and outside the complex. We then moved to the other side, and the train on that side was very loud and disruptive. But neither of these things were in the control of the management company.\n\nWhat was under their control was their customer service. Rarely did we feel attended to. Requests for repairs were sometimes met, but we were just as likely told that a repair (a leak, a clogged toilet, etc.) was our responsibility and they would try to charge us for it. To be clear, they DID charge us for it and only after a good deal of complaint, did they remove the charges. As a renter, I believe it is the owner/landlord's responsibility to make repairs on the property. \n\nWhen we moved out, we were the final tenants in a six-year run of that particular unit. The carpets had never been replaced in that time. Before moving out, I consulted with Alyssa, the property manager. She told me that the life of the carpet was five years and so they would be replacing it. Normally, carpet cleaning is billed to the tenant, but not replacement, she told me. When we left, we cleaned the place fairly thoroughly and took pictures.\n\nIn the end, they decided to clean the carpet and charge us for it, which is gross, frankly. I feel bad for the next tenants. On top of that they charged us hundreds of dollars in labor for things like putting in new light bulbs and replacing the burner pans on the stoves. The job could not take more than a few minutes. Hundreds of dollars! \n\nI know the real estate market in Bellingham is tight, but if you can find another place, I would advise you do. You will lose most of your deposit, and a lot of sleep if you have to live there. \n\nWe are currently in dispute over our deposit. If they make good, I will change my review here to note that.",

They charge carpet cleaning by the sq ft and charge by the size of the apartment not the amount of carpet  Beware and demand your refund if you have moved from that complex. They also charged $100 to open my door after hours at 6 pm one night even though someone walked down the hallway and it took less than 2 minutes. Beware of west facing apartments , especially on the top floor. Temperatures hit over 90 degrees even with fans going and blinds drawn. Look elsewhere.",

      "review": "DO NOT LIVE HERE!\n\nWhen I moved in, the carpet was not cleaned properly so I wrote on my intake form that it was okay and that there were spots on the carpet. \n\nI just received my security deposit back and they charged me $105 for regular cleaning and $120 for deep cleaning! The carpet was not deep cleaned when I moved in why should it be now. \n\nThey also deducted ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for changing of lightbulbs (THAT ALL WORKED WHEN I LEFT) and drip pans! Who charges for drip pans? That is supposed to be managements cost not the renters responsibility.\n\nI was accused of leaving items behind and plastic removal from garbage disposal yet it worked when I was there and I never would put plastic in the garbage disposal like an idiot. Also I cleared the apartment out when I left which makes no sense at all why they would charge for leaving items behind. \n\nAlso the maintenance team stole my power drill from my apartment. UNPROFESSIONAL! \n\nDO NOT LIVE HERE!",

      "review": "I lived in an apartment at a Westview Property downtown Bellingham for a month before moving out due to the level of noise in and surrounding the building, and had $750 deducted from my deposit despite ZERO damage or wear to the apartment (and having it professionally cleaned before leaving), and continuing to pay rent for the duration of my lease.\n\nThe first most important issue is the unbearable noise levels both inside and outside the building; I had a water-facing apartment, which initially seemed great, but ended up being so nerve-wracking because of constant noise I had to move out. \nThe noise ranges from blaring, extended horn blasts from trains passing by no less than 5 times a night at all hours of the night, constant construction noise (including incessant beep-beep-beeps from trucks backing up) from 7am-7pm 6 days a week from the waterfront development (which will be ongoing through 2019), amplified music from bands playing across the street at the Market every Saturday throughout the summer, loud DJ music from private parties at the Depot until as late as 2am, and drunk students yelling and carousing at an outdoor bar directly downstairs from the building from 6pm-11:30pm. \nInside the building, tenants blast music on a high-bass surround-sound stereo systems, and neither the walls, flooring or windows muffle sound. I could hear conversations my neighbors were having, along with other unmentionable things they were doing, every night.\n\nThe second big issue is the lease; it is wildly complicated and a lesson in why you should have an attorney review all contracts before signing - there are tons of hidden fees and unreasonable costs buried in the text of the multi-page agreement - and you will get money deducted from your lease no matter how untouched you leave your rental. I was in my apartment a total of 4 weeks and left the place immaculate, and was still charged a cleaning fee, plus fees for things like 1 roll of toilet paper I had left as a courtesy in the bathroom.\nThe management is staffed by people who don't seem to want to take the time to explain any of their policies; when I asked to have a move-out inspection done by my parents, who were co-signers on the lease, they made an appointment, then, told my elderly parents that they \"forgot\" the appointment when they showed up, and that they were not allowed keys or able to enter the apartment anyway even though they co-signed the lease. This was not mentioned at any point, or when I set up the walk through appointment. The staff also became terse, difficult and argumentative when my parents tried to ask them questions, so they ended up leaving feeling defeated and like they were treated poorly. \n\nThe apartment also had a bad, onion-y odor, my previously clear skin broke out shortly after moving in, and cleared up soon after I moved out.\n\nAll in all, after 25 years of renting apartments in cities large and small, this was one of the worst living experiences I've ever had, and despite appearances, the way this company treats people and gets their money - taking advantage of a high-cost rental market - is shameful. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone looking for a reasonably comfortable and quiet place to live.",

      "review": "I used to really enjoy living in a Westview-managed apartment, but I have been thoroughly disappointed lately, feeling as though management has perhaps switched hands, because service has gone completely downhill. \n\nThey seem keen on utilizing classic sleazy landlord techniques like cheap, band-aid fixes, and while they are quick to respond, is it really fixed if it's just going to break again in a month? It didn't help that my completely justified frustration with said 'quick fix' was met with a lot of unwarranted attitude and back-talk by one of the employees in the office. \n\nWhat was once a beautiful apartment complex, seemingly aimed at young professionals, has since become a dumping ground for rowdy college students, the hallways now trashed from spills of fluorescent yellow paint and what looks like vomit. The parking lot is littered with cigarette butts and trash, and so many poorly parked vehicles, overlapping your space and making it nearly impossible to get out. The traffic from the surrounding businesses regularly blocks parking access altogether. \n\nIt's really a shame; what would have been a 5 star review a few years ago is now barely deserving of 1.",

      "review": "Such a shameful company. They have treated us terribly during our move out. Improperly (and illegally) entering our apartment for a showing, thereby terrifying my roommate by having a strange man enter her bedroom while she was sleeping. They further locked doors to litter boxes repeatedly, and didn't lock the front door on another occasion. \n\nThey had the nerve to complain about the disarray the house was in, which was purely due to the typical chaos of taking everything out to get into boxes.\n\nLease here at your own risk!",
