        "review": "I lived at Garden Home Apartments for two years. They are very well maintained units. The grounds are well maintained and the staff is friendly and attentive. Best of all they are pet friendly. At the time I lived there they were one of only a couple complexes that allowed two dogs and larger dogs. The only real downfall is the location. They are situated right next to I-5. Even though they are well insulated you can hear the interstate traffic when the windows and doors are closed. Since there is no air conditioning it can be very uncomfortable in the summer. You have to open the windows and the sliding glass door. You can't hear the TV with the door open. Eventually it led to my finally moving.",
