Quiet, beautiful, just steps from some of the best trails and just a short walk to downtown Fairhaven. The management team led by Meghan is wonderful to work with and the maintenance staff is fast and efficient. I simply cant say enough good things about this apartment community.",

        "review": "I've lived at Padden Creek Apartments for almost five years, and I can't say enough positives about the experience. The office staff is experienced, friendly, and efficient, and maintenance is great as well. Any work is done quickly and efficiently. The complex is also a friendly community--many of the tenants have lived here for years, and we all know each other. The apartments are in a great location, next to miles of woodland trails and hiking, as well as a short walk into historic Fairhaven.   Rent prices are competitive, the location is superb, and the management is the best. You can't go wrong renting here. If I weren't moving out of town for work, I wouldn't even consider leaving.",

        "review": "Wonderful location, with walking/hiking trails right outside the door and easy access to Fairhaven Park and the Fairhaven shopping district.  My apartment (rented sight unseen as I moved from the east coast) was probably on its last tenant before renovation, so the trim and kitchen/bathroom cabinetry were worn and a little disappointing.  But it was clean, quiet, the apartment layout was great, the grounds were pleasant and well maintained, and the staff was friendly and very responsive to the few maintenance issues that arose during the year that I lived there.  I moved out because I bought a house in the neighborhood--otherwise I'd still be there!",

The entire staff is friendly, hard working and willing to do what it takes to make you feel secure in your choice of living in this beautiful community. Then, there is Miss Jennifer, the way that she took care of our family through this entire process was note worthy. She was direct, kind and accommodating and our family is thrilled to live in these beautiful apartment homes.",

They have my email and phone number but they couldn't be bothered to contact me. If I did not see the notice my car would have been towed. This is how they treat a paying tenant who never companied about anything.  The worst part is they are constantly email us \"We are in this together\" yeah right but hey its a nice location",

        "review": "Could not ask for a better location.  Right on the trails, creek and behind Fairhaven park.  Very pet friendly.  I have wonderful neighbors.  Staff is warm hearted and appreciate tenants inputs especially if done respectfully and with a solution in mind.  Pool has received much TLC with brand new surfacing and a large quantity of quality poolside furnishings.  Maintenance is very responsive and very friendly.  Grounds are kept immaculate. Area is very quiet with polite neighbors.  No parties or beer bottles laying around. ;)\n\n...  Some appliances could be updated but hey, they cook, clean and keep cool just fine.\n...  A little more Sq. footage be nice.\n\nThe only reasons why a star is missing.\n\n...  Staff, location, tenants/neighbors and care of grounds easy 5 stars!\n\nResident 3 years",

        "review": "Yes, the location is lovely, but that is the only positive. The soundproofing between apartments is non-existent. I could hear my neighbors snores as clearly as if he were in my room. The appliances are cheap and worn out. We had to tie down the freezer door to keep it closed because the weatherstripping had worn out, and the dryer wouldnt completely dry the clothes. But the worst complaint is the tactics of management to scam money off the tenants. As other reviewers have said, they raise rent each year by increasing all the extras each year as well as the base rent. I guess in a market with so few rental options its not surprising if most landlords will take advantage where possible. However, their pattern of scamming the rental deposits is more than taking advantage; it is fraud. I paid $700 in a deposit and was informed that only $260 was going to be returned. The rental office representative claims the cleaning wasnt up to their standards, there were unlatched holes in the walls, and the chains hanging outside the front door for hanging baskets werent removed. The apartment was thoroughly cleaned, there were no unlatched holes, and another rental office representative told me to leave the chains. Based on the number of similar reports and reviews, I can only assume that the management company, SUHRCO condones or even trains this type of behavior. Be warnedyour deposit is not a deposit but rather a fee. The area is beautiful but the management is ugly.  Update: After communicating directly with the management company executives, I received a full refund of my deposit. While I was pleased for the outcome, Im still disappointed at the time and effort it took this outcome.",

        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Dear Eric, we understand it is frustrating to receive a towing notice. Several other residents received the same notices, so it wasn't a personal situation. We have emailed all residents several times in the last 6 months to remind them to update their vehicle info and to be sure they are following the parking policies in the lease they have signed and agreed to. For future reference, if there is a delay in your renewal you can let us know and we'll make a note in your file. There are several businesses in the Bellingham area you can walk in to renew your tabs, or of course you can go online to renew at dol.wa.gov and show us the receipt while you wait for them to come in the mail."

        "review": "This is by far the WORST place my husband and I have ever lived. What's more is my husband was a property manager previously and knows Washington state tenants rights and fair housing laws like the back of his hand. \n\nMeghan is incredibly unprofessional and unintelligent in regards to her job and tenant rights. She was extremely unhelpful and has poor customer service skills.\n\nIf you choose to live here, get EVERYTHING in writing. Do not consider in-person/ over the phone communicate sufficient. \n\nMy husband is extremely careful when handling business without written communication and continually struggled with Meghan and her \"interpretation\" of the lease and mail sent to us. Their answers to our questions often ended up being guesses, in which they never made right with us. \n\nThe check-in and check-out was sketchy at best. They ended up charging us for items listed as \"required\" or \"maintenance\" on the lease and were described as not being tenant responsibility. Meghan \"interpreted\" this to mean it what not our responsibility to paint ourselves, but we should have to pay for it... WHAAAAT?!?! That is not how the originally \"interpretation\" was explained to us when signing the lease.\n\nI could go on with story after story of unprofessional and sketchy behavior from Meghan and the office staff (I think the other lady name is Erin?) that we and numerous neighbors have experienced, but I feel like you get the point.\n\nOverall, I would NEVER recommend Padden Creek Apartments or Fairhaven Creek Apartments to my worst enemy.",

Maintenance guys come to fix things right away when you call for a work order. The apartment is a little dated but it's like 30 years old. Everything is clean and functional and the location can't be beat! Right on the Interurban Trail and Fairhaven Park. The other tenants are mostly quiet older folks or working professionals so quiet for the most part. They are super pet friendly! We have 2 dogs, one is an ESA and a cat and all 3 are allowed. The office is always helpful and friendly. We got a free carpet cleaning when we renewed our lease. All in all a comfortable pet friendly place to live.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In the beautiful setting of Bellingham, WA, Padden Creek Apartments seems to delight residents with its serene surroundings and proximity to nature trails and downtown Fairhaven. User reviews frequently highlight the quiet and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere of the community, citing the well-kept grounds and the benefit of having such amenities as the Padden Creek trail right at their doorstep. The complex appears to offer a pet-friendly environment, adding to the charm for animal lovers. Moreover, a number of users express their satisfaction with the staff, describing interactions with them as pleasant and commending their professional demeanor.</p><p>The maintenance staff at Padden Creek Apartments receives accolades for their efficiency and swift response to repair requests. Residents appreciate the attentive service, which compliments their living experience. The management team, led by individuals such as Meghan, has been described as wonderful to work with, showcasing dedication and a sense of community. Renters who have called this place home for multiple years speak highly of the apartment complex, emphasizing a strong sense of neighborliness among residents and an overall friendly community feel.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Exceptional experiences at Padden Creek Apartments are not uncommon, with several residents offering high praise for interactions with staff members. Jennifer, in particular, has been singled out for her exemplary customer service, ensuring that residents feel secure and well cared for throughout their stay. This reinforces the property's reputation as a responsive and caring community. Positive experiences extend beyond the staff, as the apartments' location continues to be a significant draw, offering easy access to local amenities and fostering a vibrant living environment.</p><p>From the perspective of long-term residents, the Padden Creek Apartments stand out for their commitment to continuous improvement. User reviews make note of the refreshing of the pool area, with new surfacing and high-quality poolside furniture, symbolizing the management's responsiveness to residents' desires for a more luxurious experience. The presence of amicable and courteous neighbors further reinforces the sense of community, contributing to a peaceful and enjoyable living environment that sets Padden Creek Apartments apart.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the many positive aspects of Padden Creek Apartments, some tenants have faced issues, particularly with noise insulation. One user review mentioned the lack of soundproofing between units, which allowed for the clear transmission of noises such as neighbors' snores. Additionally, while the site's aging charm is appreciated by some, others have pointed out that the appliances and fixtures could benefit from an upgrade, as they appear worn and sometimes function poorly, for instance, a freezer door that doesn't seal properly or a dryer that doesn't thoroughly dry clothes.</p><p>Several reviews also express dissatisfaction with management practices, particularly concerning towing policies. One user recounted an unfavorable experience where management threatened to tow their vehicle over expired tags without prior personal communication, which was particularly inconvenient during pandemic times. Further criticism was directed at the seeming lack of transparency and assistance from the management team when dealing with such matters, indicating room for improvement in the property's management approach.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most severe grievances about Padden Creek Apartments stem from allegations of management employing tactics that some residents perceive as dishonest, particularly when it comes to handling rental deposits. One tenant detailed a frustrating experience where a significant portion of their deposit was withheld for questionable cleaning and repair charges. User reviews suggest a pattern where residents feel unfairly charged, which has led to claims of potential fraud by the management company, SUHRCO. However, it is worth noting that, in at least one case, direct communication with the company's executives resulted in the resolution of this issue and a full deposit refund.</p><p>Additional ugliness surfaces in user experiences concerning the attitude and professional conduct of certain management staff members, with some tenants labeling interactions as \"unprofessional\" and \"unintelligent\" when it comes to understanding tenant rights. The check-in and check-out procedures have also come under fire, with allegations of unclear terms and inconsistent application of the lease agreement leading to unwelcome charges. These negative encounters have led some reviewers to advise future tenants to put all communications in writing to safeguard against misinterpretations or unwarranted fees. Overall, while the setting may be beautiful, management practices have tainted the experiences of some residents, leaving a blemish on the otherwise appealing community of Padden Creek Apartments.</p></section>"
