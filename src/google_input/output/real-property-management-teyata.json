        "review": "Terrible property management.. Started out great but once our original property manager left the company it has been all downhill. Both the tenant and myself have gone weeks without return calls from our supposed property manager. When we finally hear back it is one excuse after the other from lost phone to locked out of emails, to never got any messages and so on. Once we reached out to the renters the many made up stories didn't add up. Unprofessional and dishonest. If you are looking for a property manager save yourself some headache and keep looking",

          "text": "John, \n\nThank you for reaching out. We apologize for the troubles you feel are an issue here. As a company, we strive to ensure we keep an open line of communication between us and the owners, and us as the tenants. However, keep in mind that your tenants have not voiced anything along the lines of these concerns to us, as they have utilized all parties involved to get in contact with if your property manager is unavailable. I am sorry you feel as if we have been dishonest. Just to point out that this all started with your assumptions of the previous tenant being responsible for replacing the appliances, where as that was not expressed to us, nor in the previous lease agreement with the old tenants. When the time came, and we had to get a new appliance is when most of your concerns arose, and you stopped communicating to us. I understand how you may feel as though in that situation we are being dishonest, and truly apologize for making it seem as that or making excuses, where as our intent is to layout all info for you whether or not it is something you wanted to hear. Sometimes that may be letting you know what came up in a certain situation, but that line of communication will always be there if you are opening to communicating with us. \nPlease feel free to reach out to us via text or call for further assistance."

        "review": "Update 2:\nMore maintenance woes. RPM is not communicative at all, and provides no updates on maintenance requests. Our dishwasher went out in late December, we filed a maintenance request for it on December 26th, and now, as of March 7th (72 days later), it's still broken. They did at one point send a maintenance person out to take a look, but they determined the issue was with the mainboard in the dishwasher, and they'd let our PM know to figure out next steps - that was around the start of the new year. The only update we have gotten since then was when we filed a second maintenance request for it - at which time, the only response we got was along the lines of \"Don't file two requests, it makes it harder for us.\" They used to have a dedicated person to oversee maintenance requests, but it appears that is no longer the case. I would not recommend renting from RPM, bottom line.\n\nUpdate:\nOur first year of renting from RPM was great, with very responsive and helpful staff, but our second year was plagued with unanswered calls and texts, months-long repair waits, and a fair bit of confusion.\n\nFor context, we had a pipe burst at one point, and after that was fixed, there was a hole left in our wall from the repair for a number of months before they finally sent someone out to patch it. When Kelli left the company, we were formally introduced to Logan as our new property manager, but we were never notified of Logan's departure at a later date, which led to a lot of confusion on *who* exactly was our property manager - we were under the impression it was still Logan months after his departure.\n\nThe text-able phone number listed on our tenant portal doesn't seem to be monitored, as no texts sent to it have been responded to since Logan left. Phone calls to the other number on our tenant portal seem to always go to voicemail and we have, to my knowledge, not received calls back. Emails to our new property manager seem to be the way to go - but that email is not listed on our tenant portal, and we had to get it from our property manager's voicemail.\n\nThat all said, the actual quality of maintenance, quality of our home, and rent price has been pretty good, but communication and transparency could do with some work. Overall, I think I would very tentatively rent from RPM Teyata again, but they would likely not be my first choice.\n\nOriginal Review:\nNothing but good experiences with RPM Teyata so far! Kelli and Logan have been especially helpful with our move-in experience.",

I had a broken smelly dishwasher for 3-4 months and I got a call about fixing the thing AFTER I moved out of the property. They dont send receipts from work they said they had done after I moved out. Didnt give me back my security deposit after I left the house spotless, and had it all professionally cleaned. Carpets and all",

        "review": "We started using RPM Teyata in January of 2021, slowly transferring properties to them throughout the year.  We intentionally waited to review RPM until we had been working with them for a year.  With 9 units now under their management and a year's worth of experience with them, we can honestly say that we would strongly recommend them!\n\nKellie is an absolute pleasure to work with! She is very professional, communication is great, and she genuinely has our best interest at heart and cares about taking the best care of our properties and our tenants, both of which are very important to us.  We feel confident having her represent us.\n\nEric handles the billing side and is also great to work with.  He is pleasant, knowledgeable, and professional.  Rental deposits are consistently on time and accurate.  Questions are always addressed and either clarified or resolved without having to repeatedly revisit and waste time, which we really appreciate.\n\nWe have self-managed for about 12 years and had reached a point where, with personal obligations, it was just too much.  We tried another company first, but the knowledge and experience of the support staff was lacking and inconsistent, communication was poor, accounting was unintelligible at times, and follow-through was awful.  Mistakes are to be expected in life (from us as well), but the key with RPM has been great communication and consistent and competent execution of whatever task is at hand.\n\nWe have been very pleased with Kellie and RPM Teyata and the load they have taken off of us.  Thank you, Kellie!!\n\nRob and Angie Scofidio",

They raised the rent after a year, plus raised it another $500 when we left. They took pretty much our entire security deposit. They charged an exorbitant fee for landscaping even though when we first arrived, the yard was just a sand pit and invasive blackberry. I took time to plant native plants and clover but they still decided to charge about $600 from the deposit for that. They hire the cheapest labor possible so cabinets just fell apart, fridge stopped working, the paint job was horrible.\n\nPipes froze and burst both summers. Our neighbor helped us out with that and said that whoever did the plumbing did a terrible job.",

She has also done many little extra things at no cost and has actually really acted as an owner in her care for our place and fixed and put back little things like it was a place that she loved herself. We highly recommend using her service.  The prices are reasonable for what they provide.

Since I was on the need for property management services after dealing with other company fails I've contacted him and we started working together. It was night and day difference. I wish I had done this before and avoided all the headaches I had with the other company.\nRight now, they're leasing my property. Three words to describe their service are professional, reliable and responsive. It gives me that hands off investment mindset so I worry more about life and not tenants.\nI find the quality of the service you get for the pricing is unmatched in the area.

          "text": "Jennifer,\n \nThank you for taking the time to share your experience. We are truly sorry in how this has played out, and is being perceived. However, the water coming into the basement and the necessary mold remediation were not our fault. We worked with you and the tenants to the best of our ability during the 5 months we managed your property.  We realize that you were unaware about the foundation issues that caused the primary bedroom and bathroom to be unusable to the tenants. This left both parties in an unideal situation as the tenants could not use/occupy part of their rental property, and you did not have the financial backing to support that fix at that moment. Per your email to the tenants (which we have, and can happily share), you agreed to let them out of their lease as well as agreed to refund all of their previous rent payments and entire security deposit. After they moved out, you changed your mind about this agreement and would not refund them. Taking this information into account and referring to your original email with the tenants, there was no fraud on our part. We then gave you all the rent we collected from the tenants from the date they moved in to the date they moved out (minus our management fees). We also provided statements twice a month through the contract period accounting for all funds collected. Yes, we did refund the entire security deposit back to the tenants as you originally agreed to do. Honestly, I was shocked to see this review because you know how hard we worked to keep them from seeking legal action, and in the best interest for you. We understand that a rental property is a huge investment on your end (the owners), and I am sorry that this was not a positive experience for you. I sincerely regret any negative feelings you may have gained due to this experience, and genuinely appreciate your feedback, and please know that we take all feedback, good and bad, very seriously. We can only learn from these experiences and do better in the future. \n\nKindest regards,\nThe Teyata Team.\n\n"
