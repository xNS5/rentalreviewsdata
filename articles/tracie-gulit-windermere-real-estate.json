        "review": "Tracie did an amazing job for us and helping us buy our dream farm in Ferndale, WA. We decided to move,  in a very tight timeline with some complexity and Tracie was fantastic from start to finish (and beyond). She had great suggestions for us and local knowledge to help us get settled in quickly. She just really took care of us as we managed to get our house in Seattle sold quickly and prepared to move the 2 hours away. Everything really went smoothly because of her communication and hard work.",

        "review": "How did my wife and I get so lucky to pick Tracie as our agent! Based on feedback we received, we decided to enlist Tracie in helping us find a house in the crazy, Bellingham market. From our first meeting to the day we finally procured the keys to our new house, Tracie was absolutely amazing.  There are quite a few traits that stuck out to us about her:\n\n1. She is tireless worker. She answered our texts, e-mails, and phone calls whenever we had them. She may have other clients, but you won't know it. We always felt like we were here one, and only clients.\n2. Her knowledge if the home buying process is second to none. It was reassuring knowing that she would never let us get into a bad situation when it came to writing offers and/or reviewing counter offers.\n3. Tracie understood our budget and did not let us wander from it. She was very conscious of only showing homes that not only meet our needs, but arrived within our budget.\n\nAnd the best part about working with Tracie? Her upbeat and can do attitude! We were under a serious time constraint to find a place to live. Even as our deadline loomed over us, she was still optimistic that we would not only find a house, but we wouldn't settle. That went a long ways in helping the confidence of my wife and I.\n\nThis sounds so cliche, but not only did we find our realtor for any of our future needs, but I'd like to think we found a friend as well.\n\nThanks Tracie!",

        "review": "Tracie is a the complete Realtor. She kept working and found us a house in a wonderful neighborhood that we could afford. This is after I about gave up. She constantly kept searching, showing, calling until we got our dream home. Even got us a loan officer that we simply love.\n\nSince it was a \"good bones\" sorta house, Tracie also found us a contractor, tree trimmer, plumber, painter, gas inspector....this lady is the complete package. \n\nI highly recommend Tracie to anyone seeking a home, condo or apartment.\n\nMichael Azevedo",

We are first time home buyers with minimal real estate knowledge and Tracie was fun to work with, passionate, and dedicated to finding us the home that was a good fit.

        "review": "We have had the pleasure of working with Tracie on two different real estate transactions. When helping us buy our house she highly encouraged us to hold onto our current property as a rental - something we never dreamed was possible. She even went so far as to provide us with great advice and resources to find and maintain excellent tenants. Later when we decided to sell our property she was able to do so quickly and effortlessly. She truly went above and beyond and checked in with us through every step of the process. We would not hesitate to refer her to our closest friends and family and will continue to use her services in the future.",

She is warm, professional, and a vast source of knowledge. I felt completely comfortable bringing her any and all questions and could always count on her to reply in a timely manner. She kept channels of communication open perfectly, but I never once felt pressured to take a step I wasn't comfortable with. I am so grateful she was my first contact in this ever-changing and complex market and would 100% recommend her to anyone.",

Tracie helped us understand the value of owning a home and explored what this could mean for our lives. We now own a beautiful home (our first!) in a neighborhood we love! She helped us with every step of the way from viewing a bunch of possibilities, to making an offer and buying our home (all while 9 mo pregnant btw!) I felt really good about working with Tracie because she was committed to our dreams coming true! She is dedicated to every part of the process and made us feel confident and comfortable with this new step! I highly recommend her to everyone! Even if you're just curious, talk to Tracie!",
