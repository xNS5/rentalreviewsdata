        "review": "We rented a 3-bedroom 2nd floor apartment for 5 months while house-hunting. It was great to find a unit that we could rent by the month; also it was cat-friendly. We were the first occupants of the unit, after construction of the building. Having all solid surface flooring was nice, but there appeared to be no noise insulation at all behind the walls or between the floors. We could hear the showers running and toilets flushing from the 3rd floor apartment above us with amazing clarity. The neighbors above us had a dog and we could hear his claws scratching the floor when they played with him (we assume) inside. (We didn't hear all his \"pawsteps\" though.) The owners/residents had heavy footfalls and we *could* hear them walking. We tried our best to walk softly so we wouldn't bother the people below us but we don't know if we were successful. We didn't have any issues with maintenance, and the property management company (Landmark) was fine, with professional and helpful staff. No surprises with fees, etc. CenturyLink is pre-wired into the units for Internet/cable; as of the time we stayed there, no other provider was available in this building. We have no regrets about staying here but wouldn't want to be long-term residents.",

This complaint indicates a potential comfort issue, especially for those sensitive to noise, leading to disruptions during daily life.</p><pMoreover, maintenance is described as somewhat lacking, with instances of garbage overflow indicating possible neglect in property upkeep. The lack of on-site management can exacerbate this issue, as residents feel their concerns may go unheard or unresolved.

The overflowing garbage situation highlighted in user reviews underscores a lack of oversight and responsiveness from property management. Such neglect not only affects the aesthetic appeal of the property but can also pose potential health and safety issues for all residents.</p><pAdditionally, the absence of an on-site contact for emergencies or management-related questions creates a frustrating experience for tenants. The lack of owner responses to reviews indicates a disconnect between management and resident concerns, which could foster dissatisfaction among those living at the property. This perceived negligence likely contributes to the overall lower rating and could be a deterrent for prospective renters seeking a reliable and responsive living environment.</p></section>"
