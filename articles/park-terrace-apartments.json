Liz, the onsite manager, routinely answers questions via text within 30 minutes and never failed to resolve any of my issues. The trees and foliage that line the walkways between the four apartment buildings are full of birds and squirrels which is always nice in the spring. The parking is plentiful, and the location is very nice for access to downtown and grocery shopping. The cost of rent is very affordable for the space of the apartments. Sad to leave but on to bigger and better things!",

Unfortunately Christy, the offsite manager, could majorly improve how she speaks to people in terms of unnecessary rudeness. I checked in to see how our rental app was coming and she proceeded to rightfully explain that she only makes reference calls once (sure, its frustrating when it means there was a miscommunication with someone and wont be revisited, but I understand from one busy woman to another) but then continue to state that our application is dead in the water. Hope Liz gets a raise though!",

A user review pointed out that the offsite manager, Christy, could improve her communication skills, citing an interaction where Christy was described as unnecessarily rude. This experience left a negative impression despite the user's understanding of the situation. Miscommunications seem to be a recurrent issue, especially concerning application processing, which some residents find frustrating when not handled with empathy. Improving these communication challenges could greatly enhance the overall resident experience.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>No particularly 'ugly' situations have been highlighted in the reviews for Park Terrace Apartments. Although there are areas in need of improvement, particularly with offsite management, there have been no reports of severe neglect or major grievances that one might categorize as ugly. Current reviews do not mention issues such as unreturned security deposits or persistent maintenance problems left unresolved. This indicates that while there are difficulties to address, the property management avoids the most egregious pitfalls reported at some other rental properties.</p></section>"
