        "review": "I have lived at Fairhaven Harbor Apartments for nearly 18 months. I have owned free standing homes for many years. I can honestly say that if any of the apartments I lived in prior to owning were as wonderful as Fairhaven Harbor, I would never have purchased a house. The owner and management team are professional, very efficient, super customer centered, and just plain nice. This place has it all, including a perfect central location which is very walkable. The apartments are modern, attractive, roomy, comfortable and quiet. The common areas are spotless and the entire building is very well maintained. The views from the tastefully furnished rooftop deck are breathtaking, especially at sunset. I love that parking is assigned with much of it under the building. There are lots of other well thought out extras included in the rent. I have looked at most of the other rental options in this area. Fairhaven Harbor Apartments is by far the best in my opinion. This is home.",

Great location for walking around, going to the coffee shop, grocery store within walking distance. We love Fairhaven. Lots of delicious restaurants very close by. Manager Jackie is very accommodating and kind, she answered all of our questions. No complaints at all.",

The apartments are going fast!\nThat is why I told you it would not be a good use of our time to show you apartments that would not be available in June or July\nGood luck in your search!",

        "review": "The apartments are okay. Great location, but the construction just isn't there. I was in a unit above the gym for about a year and was woken up after 11 PM and at 5:30 AM due to the sounds of the treadmill below me. It was completely nerve wracking to get some sleep or try to cook dinner and be disturbed by someone working out. Thankfully Dawnah and team were awesome and allowed me to move to a different apartment high up in the building.\n\nA couple weeks after moving in to the new unit I got a note underneath my door from my new downstairs neighbor asking me to keep it down / walk lighter. I haven't been doing anything crazy in my apartment. I walk around, cook, play with my dog, and when I do workouts I skip the jumping etc. I understand though. The gym was my biggest distraction in the other apartment but I could still hear my upstairs neighbor flushing his toilet or chopping vegetables. Truly frustrating.\n\nThe reason I moved into this complex was I thought it would be well built and quiet after having a terrific experience at a new build in Seattle from 2016 - 2018. Neither have proven to be the case.",

        "review": "I have been helping a friend start the apartment search in Bellingham since her lease is up at the end of August and she would be willing to sign a lease for June or July because she understands the market. We actually both work in property management with student housing, so we do understand the process. She has been living in downtown Bellingham for almost two years and is wanting a change, so I have been searching around Fairhaven for her. I came across Fairhaven Harbor Apartments and gave them a call since they did not have prices listed. I spoke to a women named Jackie and at first she was very helpful and knowledge about her property, but as soon as I asked if she had any showings available she seemed very busy in her schedule since she is currently pre-leasing. She gave me prices of two one-bedroom apartments that are available and what is included. I then proceeded to set up a time for a showing. I also wanted to let her know that my friend's current lease is up at the end of August, but is starting the hunt for a new place because she understands how hard Bellingham can be at times. By stating that I also said that she is willing to sign in June or July. I understand completely if two units are available now that they would not hold a spot at all especially since I work in Student Housing. As soon as I started to wrap up our conversation and said our date and time for a showing would work for us, the women Jackie said \"that would be a waste of our time.\" I immediately said thank you and appreciated her time. But as soon as I got off the phone I started to laugh because the lack of customer services was beyond disbelief. I hate to have this taint my impression of this property, but it has and unfortunately we will not be calling in the summer to see their availability.",
