      "review": "Positives: the office gals were always friendly to us and did their best to assist and for the space, they were a good price compared to the surrounding area - $1150 for a 2 bed/1 bath. We also loved how wide they made the staircases as this was helpful when moving in. The layout overall was also nice! It felt secluded with the surrounding nature which was part of what drew us there. \n\nNegatives: pieces of Willy Flats and the owner. The owner is not a \"people person\" at all and has no manners that we - or the neighbors we would often chat with - ever saw. He literally yelled at my partner (while he was letting our dog pee in a grassy area) telling him he isn't allowed to pee on the concrete (what dog chooses to pee on concrete?!) or on site - which the lease didn't state anywhere and there's no designated pet area on site and the apartments have nothing near by. He didn't even introduce himself or apologize after my partner corrected what the owner thought he was doing. \n\nSo, on to the apartments...they look nice overall but you can tell that they bought whatever materials could be found because few of the apartments even actually match and even within the apartment there are three different \"wood\" colors ranging from blonde to red tones - so random. The walls between people's living rooms and the next tenants bedroom are quite thin. You can hear whole conversations type thin...the floor is so cheap that dropping and ICE PACK dented it. Literally dented it. There were dents in the floor before we even moved in and we were the first ones to ever live there. There is no guest parking on site, and the apartments are in a random area with no alternate parking options available - not even a shoulder on the main road. People were CONSTANTLY making a huge mess of the trash/recycle area. They really just need to put money into cameras so they know who is abusing the rules, but it seems the owner was too cheap? So instead, every month that people made a mess of the area they would charge extra to ALL tenants. \n\nAll in all, not a great experience. Seems more of a money focus as a whole. If it weren't for the kind office staff, it'd be a 1 star.",

      "review": "Absolutely ridiculous phone etiquette. Customer service was so unexpectedly terrible. Treating us as a nuisance for wanting to see a unit. If my first and only conversation with them reflects their management style I would never bother making your first call.",

      "review": "I lived in the Willy Flats apartments managed by Roma. When I had an issue and reached out to Erin I got very timely responses and they dealt with whatever the issue was promptly. I ended up getting a job out of state and had to break my lease. I contacted Erin and was informed that my deposit would be forfeit (fair, I signed a contract after all) , but that she would try to rent my unit so I would not be responsible for rent for the remaining 2 months. I moved out mid-month, so she told me to pay the full month's rent and that should cover cleaning costs, carpet (I have animals and there is a fee listed for this in the lease), and any damage. That seemed fair to me, so I did that, not expecting to get any money back. Not only did she rent my unit, saving me a lot of money, but I was just notified that I'm getting a lot of the rent overpayment back. I did return the apartment clean and without damage, but like I said, I didn't anticipate getting any money back. I'm shocked. Roma is the first property management company that I've had where I've walked away feeling like I was treated fairly, they are so lucky to have Erin. And that's saying something, because I did break my lease and normally that would make for a bad end. I would definitely recommend renting from them if you're in Whatcom County!",

      "review": "They left during the pandemic and let all the weeds overtake the apartments. When they came back and without warning they sprayed herbicide during the middle of the day like a weekday at 4pm. I had a reaction to it as did another neighbor of mine. They have gaslighted me and they will pretend they haven't gotten your call or letters. I like trusting my landlord.",

      "review": "This company will not only use up all of your security deposit, but they will also charge you EXTRA for bogus reasons. They have failed to do any maintenance requests when you request them, they will set up all these random fees and won't answer any calls or emails when you try to reach them. Their listings are all over priced and the parking is a joke. Beware if you are a tenant or a potential tenant. Oh, and not to mention how unprofessional they are. They have their business hours set up so that no tenant can reach them in normal business hours. I hope they never screw anyone over like they did with the people I know who lived at one of their managed properties. No other management company is as terrible as these people are.",

      "review": "Amanda the \"senior property manager\", argued with my girlfriend about what room number we lived in for an extra key to borrow, my girlfriend was unsurprisingly right and Amanda offered no apology. The owner is the maintenance worker also and when our door lock broke and he replaced it the Management didn't have a copy of that new key after. We also didn't get a call from him when it became 3 hours past our appointment just because he was \"busy\" after we had to call him. And when we couldn't tell if our overhead fan in the kitchen was on because it's so weak he also could barely hear it and he left it like that and had the nerve to ask how much we cook, really?!! There are no security cameras even though it's next to a busy street where we have had to call the cops multiple times for suspicious activity, I got told by a neighbor we have had package thefts too. There's been a lot of cutting corners and poor owner effort for resolutions. Plus the complaints they send us for having a cat that likes to sit on the window ledge, surprise animals like sunshine and we're on the first floor so we aren't just going to have our windows open... And that's why we pay a pet deposit, right? No guest parking... That should say a lot on it's own. Poorly insulted windows and door jams for \"brand new\". They care about the employees first by a long shot, just look at the hours of operations... It's laughable. Amanda bring her kids to work often and it's obviously more disorganized when that happens. ...So I wouldn't recommend Roma unless you want disrespectful, cheap and selfish management. Erin is great on her own so we feel bad she has to work with the other two. Growing up in Bellingham I'm really disappointed in this property's leadership, it's just \"new money suckers\" here.",
