I asked if they had 3 and 4 bed rooms only. she cut me off and told me they only have 4 beds to rent right now. I said it might be a while till we can move as in a months. she cut me off again and said well them you should call about a month before you move and ill answer any question then. \nI felt like I did not matter since I was not moving in next week. well i'm sorry I just might have rent another apartment down the road. my family was interested in 4 apartment. we are all moving so that we can be together. but I don't think we will be moving here. I just had questions about deposits.",
