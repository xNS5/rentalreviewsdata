        "review": "I was a resident of the Foothills property for 3 years, during which I had many unfortunate interactions with the Royce Group management. I was targeted for a few dead plants at the end of season while allowing other properties to look disorderly with no resolution. I believe this was largely based on my age (in my 60s). They aggressively targeted me for things that were not even my property without asking like a civilized adult. They assumed that a TV left in the parking area was mine and threatened to fine me for its disposal. At the time, I didnt even own a TV.\nThey Impounded my car and lied about it. Despite knowing exactly where I lived, they placed a sticker on my car facing away from where it would be easily noticeable over the weekend. When confronted they said that it was towed because it was inoperable (a lie as I had driven it out of impound). They then tried to lie saying it was because the tabs were expired (also NOT the case). They did not make any attempt to call me, knock on my door, or show any good faith attempt to resolve the issue before towing. Only reason I did not sue was because my daughter found a technicality in the lease stating that they could do that if the vehicle had any disrepair ( one of my windows did not roll up all the way and my bumper had some tape on it). All of this while allowing multiple other vehicles to remain on the property without having been moved for months. This was definitely an act of aggression based on impoverished appearances. They show disdain for people of lower income. Despite that, they themselves do not keep up their own property.\nFailure to light pathways caused me to fall showing that they did not care about the safety of their tenants  as well as car damaging pot holes that they were informed of multiple times and did nothing for the entire duration of my tenancy. They continuously raised the rent despite not investing it in making their property a nice place to live for the price. They also offered a swimming pool in their advertisement which remained empty for the majority of my tenancy then was filled in with dirt (false advertising amenities). The maintenance staff were incredibly courteous and went out of their way to help. They deserve more professional employers. The dwelling itself was alright, nice storage. The place has a lot of potential to be very nice if it werent for the deplorable behaviors of their management team.",

        "review": "I have a good friend who has lived at the Foothills for 10 years. She is nearly 70 years old and has a 34 year old mentally ill son she cares for 24 hours a day. He has schizophrenia and sometimes talks out loud to the voices in his head. He is a sweet young man when stabilized and totally harmless. A new neighbor heard him carrying on a conversation with himself and got frightened. She complained to the office and they are now in the process of being evicted.\nLast October, her upstairs hot water heater exploded and flooded the upstairs bathroom and the kitchen on lower level. There is no flooring or sink in upstairs bathroom, and no kitchen sink, cupboards, or counter in the kitchen. They provided her a small wash basin to do dishes. She has continued to pay rent and continued living in these terrible conditions for 5 months.\nShe is soon to be homeless, as she can not find a place to rent. This entire situation is atrocious and should be illegal.",

        "review": "The foothills apartments give me dirty crack den vibes. I've been living here for the past year with my significant other and we're ACTIVELY trying to find anywhere else to live but what I can call the lowest end dumps in the deepest depths of hell itself. We pay 915 for a one bedroom but come a few months from now, our place will be 1050 a month. We have walls so thin I doubt paper would be a good analogy for how gaunt the walls are. We don't have any sort of dishwasher in our place and we have disruptive neighbors who play piano at odd hours and take long noisy showers also at odd hours. Our bedroom and living room will be freezing cold if we don't keep our heaters on at all hours of the day, that jacks up our electric bill quite a bit as well. The pot holes are atrocious and I'm sure they keep f'ing up the brakes of our vehicle. They claim to have a swimming pool but it's always covered and actually FILLED WITH DIRT. So, they lie, we have a leak in the ceiling and I have called the royce group about it but they haven't called back or tried to send a maintenance guy over to patch it up. The water here goes cold within minutes so you better like taking speedy showers. Oh, and our power just shuts off because the breakers get overloaded by a lamp. Most of the switches and outlets are dead in our apartment so getting things to power up is scarce to say the least. They also overcharged us to move in. 915 a month for rent but I paid nearly 3200 bucks to get a place here. Quite a rip-off and I'm concerned I'll be not able to move out since I'm straddling the poverty line. I cannot recommend these dirt bags to anyone. Hope I don't get evicted for this review!",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Among the reviews gathered, there are some positive sentiments about the Foothills Apartments. A few users noted respectful maintenance staff who went out of their way to assist residents. Their courteous service stood in stark contrast to the management practices that tenants found problematic, highlighting that the maintenance team genuinely cared about the residents' well-being.</p><p>Additionally, some users mentioned that the living environment could be enjoyable under different circumstances. For instance, one user noted that the community seems quiet and pleasant, suggesting that it has the potential to be a welcoming place for tenants. Despite the issues reported by others, this sentiment of community feeling remains a point of appreciation for some residents.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>There were limited reviews reflecting experiences that could be labeled as \"great.\" A few users shared that their overall experience was decent, particularly emphasizing aspects such as the apartment's storage capacity and pet policies. While there were complaints about thin walls and rising rents, some seemed to find the units livable. The fact that the apartments are accommodating to pets was appreciated by those with furry companions, adding a bit of appeal to the property.</p><p>Furthermore, territories including lower pricing compared to other apartments were acknowledged. While this could be seen as an attractive quality, users still expressed a clear expectation for better maintenance and living conditions that reflect the rent increases. Thus, while some tenants had good views, they felt more could be improved for a truly great experience.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Numerous user reviews vocalized dissatisfaction with the management's responsiveness. For example, multiple tenants recounted experiences where maintenance requests were ignored for extended periods, leading to frustrating living situations. In one notable instance, a tenant endured five months of living in a flooded environment after a hot water heater exploded, indicating a severe neglect in addressing substantial maintenance issues.</p><p>Moreover, tenants voiced concerns regarding the perceived lack of safety and security on the property. Stories of vehicular theft and accidents were shared, with one reviewer detailing how their car was stolen in broad daylight without adequate response from management. These issues contribute to an overarching theme of poor management and a lack of accountability, leaving residents feeling neglected and unsafe.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The reviews also highlighted some deeply troubling experiences that showcase the extent of discontent with the Foothills Apartments. At least one tenant shared their experience of being treated unfairly by management based on their age, alleging that they were targeted and harassed over issues ignored in other areas of the property. Additionally, the unprofessional treatment was emphasized as management was deemed biased and discriminatory, which added to the discomfort of living there.</p><p>Equally alarming was the mention of alleged unsafe living conditions, including poorly lit walkways and large potholes untreated by management. Complaints about a pool that was filled in with dirt rather than being maintained as advertised underscored a lack of transparency that left tenants feeling deceived. Collectively, these reviews paint a grim picture of a property that fails to deliver on basic standards of living and customer service.</p></section>"
