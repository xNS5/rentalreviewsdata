# Integra Condominium Association Management: A Mixed Experience

## Good

When it comes to property management, every story has two sides. In the case of Integra Condominium Association Management, there is a shimmer of positivity provided by a sole user review. This lone beacon in a sea of discontent speaks of exceptional service received over an impressive span of six years. The reviewer's satisfaction is emphatically highlighted by their desire to see Integra expand its management coverage within their condominium association, signaling a level of trust and administrative competence.

Taking a step further, the same reviewer recounts an instance wherein the company demonstrated significant responsiveness and professionalism: Integra commendably handled a situation involving tenants who abandoned their unit. This act of quick and effective management showcases the company's capacity to resolve crises and ensure the smooth operation of their managed properties. Such experiences, albeit rare in the gathered user reviews, suggest that the company does possess the capability to perform well when they do get it right.

## Great

Continuing with the positive aspects noted in the user reviews, the above-mentioned reviewer’s satisfaction with Integra’s performance is worth merit. An enduring professional relationship of six years is not trivial, and indeed points toward a consistent delivery of service that meets the expectations of at least some clients. The actions taken by the company in the face of tenant abandonment are portrayed as proactive and thorough, alleviating concerns for the property owner involved.

It's also worth noting that good property management can often go unnoticed, as tenants and property owners may take seamless operations as a given. In this instance, the positive feedback, though singular, emphasizes important qualities one might seek in a property management firm: longevity, reliability, and capability in crisis resolution. Such traits, when demonstrated, are the pillars upon which successful property management firms are built.

## Bad

Unfortunately, the bad seems to outweigh the good significantly. Multiple user reviews express a sense of disappointment and frustration with Integra’s management strategies. Customers speak of a non-transparent financial approach, which involves recommending low HOA fees coupled with frequent assessments. This is perceived by at least one condo owner as a bait-and-switch tactic, potentially misleading new buyers about the actual costs associated with their properties.

Poor customer service is another recurrent theme in the user reviews. The accounts speak volumes of communications mishandled and essential information withheld. There are accusations of unprofessional behavior and inconsiderate treatment towards clients, painting a troubling picture. The company's approach to management, as described by these users, falls considerably short of expected standards, contributing to an overall negative impression.

## Ugly

Digging into the deeper issues, several user reviews outline experiences that border on the egregious. There are strong allegations of unethical behavior, including taking application fees under false pretenses and a general lack of responsiveness. One reviewer went as far as to describe their interaction with the company as the "worst experience" of their lives, making a point to caution potential clients against engaging with Integra for property management services. 

Then there’s the matter of customer respect and ethical conduct, which other reviews suggest is sorely lacking. Descriptions of rudeness, deception, and a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction recur throughout the user complaints. With such serious and consistent issues raised, it paints a regrettable portrait of a company potentially shirking its responsibilities, betraying trust, and failing to fulfill the primary directive of a property management company, namely to alleviate the stresses of property management for owners and tenants alike.
