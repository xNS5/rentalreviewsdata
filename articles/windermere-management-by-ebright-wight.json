        "review": "I've never rented from an actual rental company before - I've only ever rented from private parties. I am by nature opposed to big corporations, so when I was rental-shopping, I avoided homes rented by Windermere, and other places like it. But a home I really wanted to see was Windermere's, so I finally gave in and took a look. I'm soo glad I did, because it was definitely the house for me.\n\nI have never had ANY problems or issues of ANY kind with Windermere or Ebright Wight. Doug Wight is just about the nicest guy in the world, and the best landlord I could ever have hoped to have. He is honest, he is fair, and he gets things done. Any time I have any issue or problem with my house, he sends someone right over. The girls in the office are always super nice and helpful, and I have never had any complaints whatsoever. \n\nMaybe I will sing a different song when I move out (if? I love it here.), but the security deposit wasn't even that high, so though I hope they don't keep it, as I've taken really excellent care of my house, if they do, they do. That's part of renting. \n\nIf the other renter had mentioned the dirty carpets to them when he moved in, I'll bet they would have sent someone over to clean them. Even I knew to make a list of anything wrong with the house before I moved in, and I've never done this before. I'm also bothered that he listed a lot of positives about Windermere and even said it's \"not the worst company to rent from,\" but then he gave them only 1 star? Come on. How about we rate on our experience as a whole, not penalize them for our own inability to report damage to our unit upon arrival. \n\nAs for the repair man letting himself in without authorization, it's inexcusable. I've never had it happen to me, and nothing in the world would upset me more in the capacity of renting. But I've lived here 3.5 years, and filled out my share of work order requests, and they've always been really good about calling me ahead of time. Never once have they shown up without my authorizing it. \n\nI have always paid my rent on time, and taken care of my home. I can't speak for deadbeats who don't do the same. If you're a responsible person, I absolutely recommend Windermere/Ebright Wight. I am beyond blessed to live in one of their homes. I can't rave about it more.",

We cannot get any respond from them when we need them. therefore they are all there for them self instead of taking care of your issue nor care for your property. My tenants has been rent my property for over two years and he fed up with it because of no reply or respond by the property manager when he needed help or some thing. He moved out of my property,sadly I got slapped with the bills of about $1000 on a touchup paint by Windemere management. I urge you not to use this company ,if you need  property management.take my words and so you will not be regret it. I thank you for reading your safety messages. That's all my concern.",

        "review": "DO NOT RENT THROUGH WINDEMERE! My partner and I got totally scammed by them trough the application process. First, they said we each had to apply to even schedule a viewing so we paid $45 each in application fees. After paying $90, they kept telling us the property isn't available to view yet. Then they tell us because we're not married we EACH have to make 2.5x the rent for $3400 house! Or we have to find a cosigner that makes 5x the rent (so 17K/month)!! Complete discrimination because we're not married and a total waste of time and money! We still never saw the place smh.",

        "review": "I rented from a private owner (he rents several properties) beginning of 2019. June 2022, I filed a protection order against my ex. & was awarded the home. The owner attempted to evict daughter & I. I asserted my rights & the notice was rescinded. After filing a complaint w/ HUD, the owner hired Windermere to deal with the hysterical woman that I am. I was EXTREMELY hopeful as there had been harassment & retaliation from the owner. I received a letter on my door mid-August. Windermere took exactly 2 weeks to verify after numerous calls. It also said if we had paid Sept. to the owner, that was fine, which we had by this time. Also, that a walk-through inspection to be conducted & that if refused I will be charged $100.00. Personally, I try not to open with threats when I begin a relationship. At the inspection 9/6 I advised them that our refrigerator hadn't been working. When stated that its difficult eating out of a freezer, her comment was \"that's good, at least your freezer is working\". It did not. We were eating out of a chest freezer we had brought into the home. I assumed she wrote it down while taking notes when asking my daughter & I if there are any maintenance requests to be fixed. Nope. I had to email & voicemail, & deal with the owner & his hostile & belittling texts. Eventually after an educated repair person confirmed that it was no longer working, we received a refrigerator 10/13. As I had been a month-to-month tenant for over 3.5 years with zero rent increases promised and obliged at $1525.00 per month, Windermere decided to toss a new lease at me starting at $1600.00 effective immediately due Sept. rent that had already been paid. Included was another increase, now $1700.00 effective 1/1/2023. Then \"expectations\", my parents were more lenient w/ rules & regulations when I was a child. I advised I would not be signing the lease & wish to remain month to month. 1/31 I received notice with the threat of unlawful detainer if we're not gone by 4/30 as the owner intends to sell the home. I asked if the other person on the lease had been notified as his items were still on the property. I was told they do not see anyone else listed. I let them know there is a protection order in place so if they could please communicate that, I'd appreciate it. I am still waiting to hear back. Upon the overwhelming communication as to what MY responsibilities are in the move out, that is all that was heard. Windermere was notified of my departure and that my ex could gather his items and assist in the cleaning. As soon as possible they did the walk through and give me their opinion on how the place looked. I asked for a copy of the rent increase that went into effect in Sept. I STILL have yet to receive a response. After a couple of weeks, I reached out & was told everything had been removed from the house & it was in the process of being cleaned at the direction of the owner. My ex has every character trait of narcissistic personality disorder. His stuff was #1 priority in the meaning of life. Him leaving everything confirmed my suspicions. I am disappointed that it was not communicated to me. Whatever. I also was not surprised when told that he's in the process of having the protection order amended & the owner has written a new lease for him to move back into the home 4/1 at $1,600.00 a month. I think back to May of 2022 & how I was done with my relationship & done with being punished for having the wrong response or thoughts or feelings or actions, etc. I ultimately didn't care if I had to live in my car. THANK YOU, WINDERMERE,...FOR MAKING THAT DREAM COME TRUE :o) I apologize as I believe this to be the longest review written ever. Being how I have relocated; I have also lost access to my therapist. So, this will have to do for now. I wish I could say I'm extremely grateful for them reaching out and apologizing after the threats, eviction, being notified that the owner never truly intended to sell, and completely ignoring my rights as a survivor of domestic abuse. But I'm still waiting for them to get back to me.",

        "review": "I've been renting for 3 years with Windermere in Bellingham. It doesn't matter if you are a perfect tenant in every way --- they just don't care about people. \n\nCustomer service is truly the worst I've ever experienced in any sort of environment. Not only do property managers/desk attendants avoid your as well as your calls and emails, they will conveniently \"forget\" you scheduled appointments and be unable to reschedule. They are rude to your face, via the phone and via email. \n\nMaintenance requests go unanswered for years. Yes -- I said years. They do absolutely the bare minimum for their clients and its truly stomach churning. I would recommend any property management company but Windermere.",

        "review": "I have quite the story to share with the public about Windermere Property Management of Bellingham. I would also highly recommend that you visit windermerewatch.com for more valuable information. \n\nMy boyfriend and myself signed a lease with Windermere on a place located in Ferndale back in July 2017. I had already been through several other local property management companies and had bad experiences with two others in simply applying for a place and by way of misrepresentation of properties and wasting time looking at them and or applying for them just to find out they were in really bad shape unlike the photos led one to believe. I was actually under the false impression that Windermere was a reputable business. Unfortunately that was FAR from the truth. \n\nOn July 1st we began moving our things to Ferndale, actually my boyfriend did as I was to be flying out of Sea-Tac the following morning at 7:00 am. I stayed back to pack and we left for Sea-Tac that afternoon as we had a hotel room so that I didn't have to be on the road in the middle of the night to drive there from up here. We had dinner and went to our hotel where Bruce said his throat was sore. He said it was burning. I was concerned about it as my trip the next day was to visit my Father who was in the hospital with complications from Leukemia/Chemotherapy. I was worried about myself becoming sick while I was visiting. I never did get sick but I spoke with Bruce everyday I was gone and he said he was not feeling well everyday I was spoke with him. \n\nI returned to Seattle a few days later and spent my first night in our new place in Ferndale. I woke up that first night several times coughing. I specifically recall wondering what was irritating my throat as it was not a cough that felt like I was becoming sick. Just an irritating, dry, unproductive cough. This was the beginning of a nightmare. I started to not feel well in all kinds of ways. My throat was burning, I felt sick to my stomach, and I kept coughing. \n\nThe next thing that happened was the second night at our place. As it was July, it was hot out. I had several windows open trying to cool the place off. While downstairs in our bedroom I suddenly began to feel as though I was going to suffocate. I had the window in our room wide open and still I felt like I could not breathe adequately. I began talking about not being able to sleep in our room and having to get out of there and panicking. I could smell something that I would describe as pollution. It was strong. I was about ready to have my boyfriend call 911 I was so scared about suffocating. \n\nThe next day we drove to our storage unit and as we were unloading our Haul in Ferndale our neighbor whom we shared the duplex with came outside on her front porch and lit up. Cigarette. This was surprising to me as they advertised all of there units as no smoking. Being a former smoker I did not really want to be around smokers because it has not been a year since I quit. What happened next was unreal. Our neighbor proceeded to tell me how she had to have her front porch replaced. She had set it on fire by putting a cigarette butt in a can without enough liquid in it and it started her porch on fire. The fire dept. was called and the porch was so bad it had to be replaced. So now I have rented a place next door to someone who has already started a fire. \n\nWithin a week another neighbor in the building next door to us flicked his cigarette into the bark in front of his place and my boyfriend came home from work to find it on fire. \n\nAs for the burning throat, suffocation fears? The property had been sprayed with Crossbow in a manner that was done without any regards for people living there. I have over 200 pictures of this massive application of known carcinogenic herbicide. Windermere let us out of our lease but did absolutely nothing to help us relocate. In fact they actually retaliated against me when after 5 weeks of daily poisoning I became impatient and emailed them letting them know I was very upset with their unresponsiveness. I documented everything daily. We got out of there after two of the worst months of my entire life. God knows what long term health impacts we may suffer. \n\nI can tell you all this much, Windermere did not care one bit about us and the horror we had to deal with worrying about the lady next door and the herbicide issue. BEWARE!!!!!",

        "review": "Moved in with three adult family members. House was brand new (still getting finished when we signed the lease, couldn't move in for a week) but had mud under the stove, scuffs throughout the house, ect...\n\nA year later (no longer on lease, but month to month) we get a notice saying that they were upping the rent by $50. The letters were sent out on the 7th, the last day in which a tenant can inform them that they intended to move without paying for the next month. We informed them on the 15th. Given when we moved in, this was our last day to inform them that we were leaving. Everything was going fine until they said we had to pay for the next month. We called them out on the date of the letters. We also informed them about how we were not allowed to move in for a week despite already paying (we received not back pay for this week either). We also consulted a lawyer on this, who said they were in the wrong.\n\nA few weeks passed, we moved into another place, everything seemed fine. That is, until they sent us an email saying we owed them $500!! They were charging us for the following month's rent, professional carpet, and house cleaning. The house was completely spotless when we returned it, there were no holes in the walls, and there was nothing in the lease about professional house cleaning, only carpet. That place probably looked better than when we moved in.\n\nWe should have sued them. Never, NEVER again!! Beware because if all of the Windermere offices are as shady as these guys, you'll get worked over BIG TIME.",

        "review": "Windermere was the Property Managment company for The Avalon Apartments while I lived there from 2014-2015.  I decided I had to finally share my story, because I came across another review that said something that helped me to connect the dots with what happened to me there.  What was said is that the maintenance is there constantly to spy on tenants and is, in fact, the owners of the property.  You'll see why this piece of information is important...\nWhile I was there, I saw the \"Maitenance\"(man and woman) on site nearly every single day.  At the time I actually didn't mind it.  It is in old building, and I figured that they were renovation it one unit at a time.  It also gave me a false sense of safety.  I felt that I had a good rapport with them, and talked to them on many occasions.  I got the sense that they liked me, as I was a quiet, working professional that didn't ever have parties.  One time I had a work order for a plumbing issue, and they had even commented on how clean the place was, and how they liked how I decorated the apartment. When my lease was up I gave proper notice that I would be moving out, as I was moving across the country for my job.  I had paid over 900 in total for my damage deposit, and wanted to be sure I did everything I could to get it back.  I specifically asked \"Maitenance\" what I could do to insure that would happen.  The floors there are the original wood that they paint brown.  I had a very heavy table that had chipped some of the paint on the floor, and asked them if they would like me to repaint the area.  They told me not to worry about it as they already have the perfect matching color, and that I wouldn't be charged for small chips.  Other than that I left the apartment spotless, and in better condition than I found it.  Now comes the part when I got royally screwed: When I went to get my deposit back from Windermere Property Managment, it was for only about 100 dollars.  I was shown a series of pictures that were either old photos, or staged.  For example: there was a picture of the stove top(that I had left spotless) with crumbs and a long black hair on it. (I was blonde at the time). They used the chipped floor, which I was told not to worry about, to charge me hundreds of dollars to repaint the entire apartment.  I could have done the same job myself for 25 dollars had they not been deceptive about it.  There was also a very old rust spot on top of the refrigerator that I did not include on my move-in sheet, because I did not see it, and it's typically not a place people look.  Even the woman at Windermere told me that she could tell that it was there for much longer than I had lived there, and would \"work on getting my money back for that.\"  I never saw any of that money, or heard from her again.  I contemplated taking them to small claims court, but since I moved so far away it was more trouble than it was worth.  These \"Owners/Maitenance\" are obviously taking advantage of their tenants, and double dipping.  Shame on them, and shame on Windermere Property Managment for allowing them to do it.  Future renters beware!  If you do decide to rent from them anyway, just be sure to take photos and video of everything before you leave so that you have proof of how you left it.  Lesson learned on my part.",

She checked and said yes you can apply for this one but we already have one application pending.  Furthermore, she explained if I want to apply I have to fill out  an application and pay $40.00 fee and wait for her manager to check and make a decision about approving or disapproving my application.  She said they already collected $40.00 for that place from previous applicant who is waiting for answer.  Then I requested to talk to her manager.  She connected me w/a designated broker SANDY JONES!  Wow!  What a lunatic and pure idiot is that SANDY JONES!  SANDY JONES said by law they can charge $40.00 fee for as many applicants as they wish/apply for the same unit.  Unbelievable!

Charged me $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment with no dish washer (even though there was a space in my counter for one?), a communal clothes washer for the entire complex and a 100 year old oven that set off the fire alarm whenever I used it. Of course I called her about the oven and instead of fixing it or replacing it she said to move the fire alarm which I'm pretty sure is illegal for her to suggest. Of course when I got my security deposit back after moving out there was a charge for them having to replace my fire alarm that she suggested I move. I called her on it and she strung me along for a week before finally telling me that the only way she could reimburse my money was to take it out of her salary and she didn't want to do that so it was a no-go.

It was worse than a portapottie seat and could not be cleaned properly it was so old. I asked for a new one repeatedly and finally my crabby husband got them to do something about it. I don't want to know how. They don't return calls or emails. Also a few months ago I changed my online payment method from auto pay to a one time bank draft. I have never missed a payment and the money was drafted from my bank account on time. Nevertheless I came home to an eviction notice on the 15th stating I had not paid. I had to verify my payment for them and they finally figured out that it was a \"glitch in the accounting program.\" They didn't even apologize. I read somewhere that it's the law for carpets to be cleaned between tenants, and that's why there is Always a cleaning fee no matter how clean you leave it. I guarantee no vacuum clean ever touched the carpet much less a carpet shampooer. I did it myself once I identified the smell coming from the carpet upstairs as being pet related. Pets aren't even allowed. One of the garage remotes didn't work when we moved in which was fine since we didn't need it. I listed it in the form when we moved in as needing to be fixed, and 10 months later I came home to a note on the door stating that they would be entering the apartment- again- for repairs/maintenance. I left the remote out-- again- and behold it works now. The actual property itself is nice enough, but I've been in other Windermere properties that were downright nasty. It just depends on how well previous tenants kept things. I could keep going... but I don't have all day.",

It was really not a bad experience overall, I enjoyed my apartment and they were friendly enough in the office. The only real problems I had were one time, without any legal notice, a repair man entered my apartment while I was sleeping. Also when I moved out, they charged me 74 dollars (tax, parts, and labor) to replace the thermostat knob on a heater in the bedroom, and 60 dollars to clean the apartment when I had somebody professionally clean it before, and 80 dollars to clean the dirty carpet. I was able to get back 30 dollars of the cleaning fee, so Windermere was fair in that sense.

Sandy Jones is my property manager and I wish I had a good experience with her but unfortunately not. This company charges for every little thing, it's ridiculous. Was charged a full year and a half after a repair was made in my kitchen and told that they would have it covered since it wasn't tenant caused. When I asked for paperwork showing why I was being charged later they had written \"tenant caused\" only like that was enough. When I emailed Sandy about my confusion she threatened to raise my rent and blamed me for the repair. I fully expect to get reamed when I move out simply because I made the mistake of choosing Windermere. I don't expect to get any of my safety deposit back, in fact it wouldn't surprise me  if I suddenly \"owed\" them more. These people are shady as hell and Sandy is a horrible person with no soul. She's willing to take advantage of my older neighbors as well as young adults trying to survive independently. I hope karma hits her with a bus because she honestly doesn't deserve any less. She does not care about you, your concerns, or doing her job properly (even things such as being in the office ever, seriously she arrives late, leaves early, and is always \"too busy to take your call\".) If you don't like money, and you love terrible property management and money hungry b**ches who will threaten you when you have legitimate concerns, Windermere is for you. There's a hundred reasons why you shouldnt choose Windermere in my opinion, but honestly just save yourself the headache.",

When they gave us the keys to move in, we discovered ONE FILTHY MESS! Kitchen cabinets and drawers had food in them, HUGE urine stains on the carpet, which was not even shampoo'd. Stickers on the bedroom door, they didn't even clean the tape residue that the workers left behind from the bathroom remodel! The rec-room blinds looked like cats had been climbing thru them, and were trashed. The owners were continually driving by looking in on us. Windemere had the gall to call us the day we moved in because someone came over with a shitzu and the dog was on a leash tied to their car, UP BY THE ROAD. They said \"no pets allowed. When I explained that we had no pets and that the person just dropped by for a minute, they replied, \" ABSOLUTELY NO PETS ON THE PROPERTY!!! Quite hypocritical considering the huge pet stains on the carpets! We assumed they would clean the carpets and dirty walls and everything else. But they didn't do any thing. When we moved out, we washed walls and left the place cleaner than when we rented it, but they would not return our deposit. They also had the nerve to sue us for 500.00 so they could replace the blinds in the rec-room. I learned a valuable lesson about taking pictures of everything when moving in to a home! No pic's- No proof! We had to pay so that the owners could do what they should have done before we moved in. Windemere is not a place to rent from if you are a person who takes pride in their home.

We scrubbed and cleaned the house after we moved in to make it our home. We did contact them about a variety of maintenance and repair requests (they refuse many and mostly ignored our voicemail and emails).    I STATE ALL THIS  because they charged us $1000 ( from our deposit) for cleaning and repairs when we moved out! Some of these charges were for items we had request they fix when we moved in. The house was bleached and scrubbed very well when we moved out. They took money for: Unclean heating ducts ( what?), dirt in the window tacks and cobwebs, dirty carpet, a dusty ledge, plus odd repairs ( water stains under kitchen sink -which is the original 1970 cabinet bottom,  track door repair ( that was rarely used & again from the 70's, plus very cheaply made). Bellingham rental properties are scarce...so they have the upper hand.  Get your agent to do a move in walk through with you...I suggest taking a detailed video with your agent in it, stating the date.

I washed the walls continuely and still the mold would return. My neighbors had the same problems. They were getting nose bleeds. I had a baby that was born preterm and the hospital would not allow me to bring him home with mold as my baby had chronic lung disease and was on oxygen full time. I called the office and told them the situation and they said that the mold was, \"Not there problem!\" The only saving grace was my sister had a friend that was high up in the corporate Windermere company and she had to call this Winderemere company and explain to them that yes, indeed it is their problem. So I was able to move into a new apartment mold free. When I moved out of my new apartment a year later they were not going to give my deposit back after I spent 3 days detailing the apartment. I used to be an apartment cleaner for a major Seattle apartment management company and was trained by Bellingham Housing Authority in turning over apartments. So I know how to clean an apartment and do it well. When I left the apartment looked cleaner then when I moved in. I did the preceedings to take them to court but settled out of court at mediation. I got what I wanted and deserved but only after fighting for it. They only care about money and good luck getting your deposit back. I was a great renter who paid my rent not only on time but a month in advance. From my personal experience,beware of this management company.",

Windermere was basically the only option at that time, and though it was more expensive than I was comfortable paying, I could afford the unit available to me. I learned that you get what you pay for.\n\nThe best and first thing that impressed me was that my apartment was incredibly well insulated, both for sound and for heat. I never heard my neighbors, and they never heard me (I checked in a few times), with my music and guitar. To be fair, I'm not SUPER loud, but I'm a pretty noisy fella, and a night owl. Apparently my HBO habit at 2:30am never bothered anyone.\nI didn't need to turn my heat on very often, save for the coldest months, so my monthly power never really broke $50 at any point. A single AC unit kept me cool in august.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, they were very responsive to maintenance requests. My water heater srung a leak, and once I submitted the request, the issue was resolved same day. I got home from work and was able to take a shower first thing.\n\nA lot of other rental companies don't have such immediate response times, and Bellingham has a lot of slumy rentals out there, but my unit with Windermere was clean, warm and cozy. Not cheap, but clean, warm and cozy. It was a great place to land and begin recovering from a big life upset.\n\nIf you make your rent, and communicate with your actual human property manager (shout out to Nicole), I expect you will have a good experience with Windermere.",

I had them dispute the charge since they took my payments on the same day every month and never got a late fee. We had them tell us 3 times about our dog poop and they claimed to have video footage but wouldnt provide the proof and wouldnt come look at the property themselves to see that there was no dog poop.

        "review": "Our experience renting from Windermere was terrible, to say the least.\n\n- Either communication between employees is completely nonexistent, or they actively ignore maintenance requests despite multiple phone calls checking in. They do not return phone calls or emails. We had a light out for two months in our apartment before they came by to replace it (the actual fixture was broken).\n- We smelled sewage within a few days of moving into our brand new building (The Vantage at 418 W Bakerview). The person who fielded my weekend call told me that was not enough of a reason to send emergency maintenance. They sent someone a few days later who determined there was no issue. Only after water started pouring into the unit below did they send someone else to fix what turned out to be a massive leak behind the wall under our kitchen sink.\n- The person who fixed that leak then sealed up the STILL wet area behind the cabinets until it started to smell. I can't tell you how many times I had to call the office to get them to respond to that maintenance request. My multiple requests for professional mold inspection were ignored. They looked under the sink, tested for moisture, and decided that was good enough.\n- The wall heaters are installed so close to the doors in the apartment that they were melting. I put in a maintenance request expressing concern for fire hazard and even followed up with a phone call. Never heard back.\n\nIf you value your safety and health in your living space, try to rent from literally anybody else. And definitely don't choose a unit at The Vantage.",

        "review": "Update: since posting this review I want to add that the staff at Windermere was extremely friendly and helpful in the process of trying to find another rental property. I am not going to remove the previous review as I think it is important for people to know that they should stay on top of their application throughout the whole process. I do however want to give them credit for working with myself and my roommate and doing everything they could to keep us updated and help us find a place to live so last minute, especially Tanya, Ashley, and Frank. Although I am still frustrated about my initial experience, I definitely am very appreciative of the effort that has been put forth since.\n\nIm usually not one to post bad reviews and try to give companies and people the benefit of the doubt but I am so upset after my experience with Windermere that I feel like I have to speak up. I am giving them 2 stars because the staff has been very pleasant and I dont think that my experience was the fault of any one person but rather a flaw somewhere in the system. My roommate and I submitted an application for one of their properties and were told when we called to ask about the property that no other applications had been submitted. They also shared that they approve or deny applications in the order that they are received. We then called back a combined total of at least 8 different times between myself and my roommate to check the status of the application and to try and get a showing scheduled to see the property. We were told it would only take a few days to process the application. After a week, I was finally able to see the property and was told by the manager that she would make sure that our application was processed as soon as she returned to the office. All of this was fine until we received a text message over a week after submitting our application that another application had been approved today and that our application had been denied. This was despite the fact that we were told our application was the first to be submitted and that we should be getting the decision days prior. I dont understand how we would be denied in favor of someone else if our application was the only one submitted at the time that we paid our fees and they claim to be first come first serve but somewhere along the way our application was not prioritized in the order we were told it would be. I am extremely frustrated and the only reason that I am considering looking into renting a different apartment with them would be to try and make up for the $65 in application fees that I have already lost and given that the application remains open for 90 days.",

Tonya found us a gorgeous place in a market that is overpriced and out of control. Great experience since day one, very fast approval process. We moved in the house in less than 24 hours from seeing it. Great experience with Tonya and all the staff there too. We needed maintenance once and they were prompt to send somebody next day.\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, one really got stuck in my head so I'll share my thoughts about it. I think it is unfair to give a management company a one star review because you have pets but the owner wouldn't allow it. Find a place that allows pets and move in, or buy your own and do whatever you want with it.\n\nWe recently moved out and in less than 2 weeks we received our deposit back, and a follow up call to make sure that everything went great with the move.\n\nLong story short, our experience was great. Tonya is awesome, the staff is awesome.\n\nThank you again for a great experience!",

I lived under them for three years and this is not an exaggeration, the agency does not care about your health or well being, only your money. Maintenence requests go unanswered for months and months unless you call every week until they fix it. If your appliance breaks good luck getting a replacement sooner that two months. MULTIPLE times did I have to go to the laundromat for long periods of time or hand wash dishes for weeks on end.\n\nWe are getting charges over our damage deposit for things we told them to fix months and years before moving out. I am getting charged out of my deposit for a light bulb that was burnt out when I moved in. If you live in an old, rotten, outdated apartment it doesn't matter, they will still raise your rent $200 at a time. Trying to raise a family? Forget it because they failed to do anything about neighbors smoking and it coming into our apartment. Look at your new rental closely because they also paint over water damage.

The unit was older and  I had some concerns about her living there but it was where the girls wanted to live.  In the end I found our property managers, both Bethany and the new prop manager Tonya, to be very helpful and attentive to all of our concerns.  All repairs were done in a timely fashion and all of the issues were addressed to our satisfaction.  And when our daughter decided to live there on her own for a while,  they worked with us then! We were treated fairly and I believe that if you follow policy, read through expectations and do what is required on your end that they will do the same.  When we moved out,  we left the unit clean and in good shape and we received our deposit refund pretty quickly. We paid to clean the carpets and yet were charged for that service again - but I didnt understand that was their policy.

When I moved back here it was so hard to find a place especially in our price range. When we found our home she helped me so much with the process of getting set up it made it so much easier on me and my family. She treated me not just well, but like family. She was always professional and she always had my back when we had a disagreement with the neighbors. She fought for me when I needed something, she was always super fast getting back to me, if I ever needed any help with anything regarding the home I am renting. Even in her spare time she would respond to me if I ever had a question or needed something. I would recommend Tonya Wiley to anybody looking for a rental in the Bellingham area she is a breath of fresh air and a ball of sunshine in the community. She always does her best to help others and she doesnt expect anything in return. I feel so lucky that I had her as my property manager for the year that I did. I know that in the future if I ever need to find Another rental or home that Tonya is who I would be contacting for any of those needs. She is not only an amazing businesswoman but she is my friend and I just wanted to share what an amazing experience I had as her client. She really helped me when I needed it the most and I will never forget that. Windermere property management is very lucky to have her. Also, the front staff at Windermere was always so kind and sweet every interaction I had with them. I never had any complaints I stand behind Windermere as a company and I stand behind Tonya Wiley as a property manager.

        "review": "Rented a three bedroom on Ashley Street for two years. The place itself was okay, though prone to mold and the windows did not close properly (they came with dowel rods to put in the tracks since they wouldnt lock). We filed maintenance requests on several occasions and they were almost always ignored (including that a pipe was leaking through the wall near an outlet when we turned on the outdoor spigot, and that the driveway was so covered in snow that it caused several accidents and was a safety hazard). These things were never addressed. We left the apartment in good condition, other than some damage done by a roommate that we gave the property manager a heads up about and took full responsibility for. We expected some money to be deducted from our security deposit for that damage, but when the charges came in the mail, Windermere took ALL of our deposit AND WAS ASKING FOR MORE. They deducted for things like about 8 hours of cleaning and full paint. They also charged for picking up trash that was outside of our bedroom window under our upstairs neighbors stairs, which was there when we moved in. They eventually dropped that charge after I wrote to dispute most of the charges, but we still ended up having to pay about $140 on top of losing our whole security deposit. We had moved out of state and it was not worth going to court over, which Im sure Windermere counts on. I should note that most of these issues happened under the watch of the previous property manager, and Ashley, the new property manager seemed very friendly in our correspondence about the security deposit, though Im sure she was limited on the help she could provide since she stepped in just at the end of our lease. I do not recommend renting from this company, and if you do, be sure to document everything.",

Tonya specifically told us that the doors had already been ordered. I waited to hear back from Windermere about proceeding with replacing the doors and after not hearing a response I texted Tonya again and didnt hear back from her until months later. Anytime my roommate or I had an issue, Tonya from Windermere was so slow to respond which was very unprofessional. I had a lot of patience and kept putting all issues aside but Windermere was to slow to fix the problems. Also the balcony doors were never replaced and I have texts to prove they were going to be replaced from Tonya. I barely stayed a year at this place before moving on.

We have had so many issues with Windermere, most of them involving the property manager not contacting us or responding to emails and phone calls. The icing on the cake was when we were never notified that Windermere was taking over (admittedly not Windermere's fault) however, then four months later I was doing my personal budget and we discovered that our condo dues had stopped automatically coming out. For 4 months we were never notified that we were not paying our condo dues! That is very alarming as a property owner when those dues are important to maintaining a reserve fund. Then, when I identified the problem, Windermere did not apologize at all for the issue and I had difficulty getting any one to call/email me back to try to rectify this issue. I could go on and on and I've only had Windermere managing my condo association for less than 6 months! The most recent issue is that we were served a random letter about needing a new water heater because it was over 10 years old. Now I can't get a call back about that! If you are paying money to have your property managed, find a different company. I am sorry to say you will be disappointed with Windermere.

She has since tried to take almost all of the security deposit for things missing, which are absolutely present and in the unit (albeit, they are not great quality, but it is what they left for us at the start of the lease.

Windermere does not respond to emails, concerns, and failed to change the trash pick up to their name (our lease has WSG included). We went several days with no garbage pickupand thats the tip of the iceberg. They do not follow ADA or fair housing act laws. It took me asking people on Reddit for advice for them to install a handicap spot. Now that that has been done, they ignored my requests for a second spot when I realized my neighbor has a disability as well. Sandi Jones is my PM and she offered me $200 to move out this summer when we had MOLD in our bathroom because she claimed they couldnt find a maintainence guy to fix the floor that was torn up by another! Incompetent and a liar!\n\nTo top this off, I was told to contact the police of people park illegally in the handicap spot. This happened a few times and the police said, private property - it is Windermeres responsibility. If I fall, Im suing Windermere and I told them I would.\n\nIt isnt just that, but several stairs are crumbling. My upstairs neighbor fell through the bottom ones years ago, and Windemere and the new owner know they need to be replaced and nothing has been done. The health department and city of Ferndale cant do anything either. Someone is going to get seriously hurt or worse, and all Windermere does is ignore emails. ESPECIALLY Sandi!

We made the mistake of being too confident in how nice we left the place that when we moved out that we didn't take any photos and got charged outrageously for things that didn't make sense or exist.\n\nWhen we first moved in, there was holes in window screens, a glue stain on the wall or something from putting carpet down (we assume that's what it is, we've tried washing it but it didn't come out with cleaner) when we first moved in. These things we pointed out when we noticed, along with a broken handle on the microwave but was shrugged off because it personally didn't bother us. There was also things already existing on the property. The garage was full of home maintenance materials, such as wood, paint, and other things. There was a shed full of miscellaneous things that looked to be there for years that we were told belonged to the home owner so we didn't touch it.\nNow we're getting charged for these things, as well as the glue on the wall being blamed on our pet.\n\nWe made sure this place was spotless and we only lived in it a year with very little use. There was a scrape on the wall from our chair and that was it. But somehow we're getting charged OVER our deposit amount. Over things like lightbulbs and other ridiculous things! We unfortunately didn't take photos, they didn't even give us a walk around to ok things either.\n\nAfter we had moved out they told us some time into the next month for the first time that if we didn't hand over the keys they'd charge us another month's rent. We never had this before because locks are usually replaced by home owners making the keys useless (beware on that also if you plan on renting from them).\nWe were moved up into Canada at the time but luckily we had to do one last run into the states to cover bases so we were able to return the keys in time.\n\nWe have never had issues with any of the rental properties we've lived in. We always got full or 90% of our deposit back. We always have had shining reviews with our landlords. We pride ourselves as good tenants.\nIf you plan on renting from Windermere, be prepared to be swindled out of every penny they can manage to get out of you. I'm seeing many reviews with the same issues we're having with Windermere word for word practically. They're known for this, I would avoid at all costs.",

Bethany in particular has been extremely kind and helpful! Where should I begin?\n\nWell, first, before we even signed the lease, there was an issue that arose from us applying to a property the owner of which didn't want rented to students. We all somehow overlooked this on its listing, and since I was just starting graduate school I declared that I was a student on my application. We were initially denied the property, but I felt that \"students\" wasn't intended to mean graduate students in their mid 20s, so I wrote them a letter explaining that I understood they need to respect the property owner's stipulations and asked if my appeal and the explanation of the circumstances could be forwarded to you owner. Bethany responded to my email and was was very nice and understanding. She explained the situation to the owner, and we ended up getting the house! Yay!\n\nWhile we lived there, they were really good about giving us notices of entry on time, and they didn't micromanage the property we rented at all--not even after they came in for an annual inspection, or when our lawn mower broke and our yard was a jungle for a few weeks while we Craiglisted around for a new one. No guff was given, it was really pleasant to rent from them. I've had many landlords that breathe down tenants' necks. I remember once, when I was a kid growing up in Montana, my family rented from someone who insisted that we shovel the walkway WHILE it was snowing. In Montana! I don't remember if it was an individual or a property manager, but the moral of this story is that landlords can be absolutely crazy.\n\nI think we were even late on our rent once, and I don't believe they dinged us for it.\n\nBut moving out this past week has been where Windermere has really shown me how accommodating they can be if you're nice about things. June rolled around, and we got notice that the house wasn't going to be re-rented after our lease expired, so we had to find a new place--fast. We found a place that became available on or a few days after the first of July, so there was going to be a day or two (or three) period where we didn't have a house. We were fine with this, but the problem was that we have four tropical fishtanks that need to be plugged in all the time. It looked like we had two options: move the fish tanks to the middle of a very generous friend's living room or garage, only to move them once more after a few days (which would stress the fish out twice as much as a normal move would, and would SUCK SO BAD since these are large tanks and all have live plants), or see if Windermere will allow us to keep them on the property after we were supposed to be totally out. Bethany again understood our situation and we were able to just leave the tanks there for a week after they could have legally disposed of them. This took a LOT of stress off of our shoulders. I really appreciated all this flexibility and reasonableness, and if I find myself renting in Bellingham again, I'll be sure to check Windermere's listings first.

The home needed paint, hauling, cleaning, repairs of a wall heater and towel bar as well as carpet cleaning. You were provided photos in court as to the documented condition of the home. You were also carrying a past due balance on your account going into the reconciliation process. Since we do not manage the storage unit where other theft was reported, we cannot speak to that situation. We offered to re-key your unit when we were informed by you of the alleged theft, and you opted to have it done. According to you the theft continued. We have no control should you leave your doors or windows unsecured. We advised that you should call the police and provide them with dates, times and descriptions of the perpetrators. In court you said you called the police many times and they never responded. You did say also that you attempted to retrieve your lost items from a neighbor and were arrested.

My son and his friend got into a lease at 800 20th Street, From October to January we attempted to talk with Windermere about concerns with toxic mold, doors that would not close or lock, mildew, moisture, open holes in flooring and sideboards, etc.  We did not receive any response until January. However, the response did nothing to repair the problems, except to fix one of the doors so it locked.  I doubt that this place would pass an electrical inspection.  My son eventually was diagnosed with multiple illnesses related to the ongoing mold infestation.  To sum it up = do NOT do business with WIndermere Property Management.  They continue to have this place on the market and are misrepresenting it. I am saddened that a fine company like Windermere would do this.  We had previously listed two of our homes through them.\n\nAfter reading the others reviews - I really wish we would have checked out the property management side of their business.",

They are wolves in sheep's clothing. I put 1200 down to hold the place. Was listed as move in at end of month or month. According to Jay, the listing agent, the 22nd IS the end of the month. He must have a different calender then the rest of the world. What a joke he is. Heads up, still not end of month. End of month is still coming 2 days away. Take note to the person who is confused .

          "text": "Thank you for your feedback. We would like to take this opportunity to respond to your comment.\nWe imagine your unfavorable review is written in response to the Deposit Disposition letter you received recently.\nThe back side of the move out notice provides a comprehensive list of items that need your attention prior to move out. It is very important that the unit is left in good condition and ready for the next tenant to move in. Unfortunately this was not the case when you vacated your unit. The unit was left dirty and required 5 hours of cleaning. The kitchen was particularly dirty. The paint was new upon move in and according to HUD guidelines the life expectancy for paint is 5-7 years. When you moved out there was damage done to the paint beyond normal wear and tear. The walls throughout had black soot damage on them to which left outlines on the walls where items had been hanging. You were charged for  of the cost to paint the unit.\nWe work very hard to be fair to our tenants while still doing what is right by the property owner. If you have items you would like to discuss regarding your experience with Windermere Management, we would be happy to meet with you."

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Windermere Management by Ebright Wight has had its share of commendations, particularly related to individual staff members and responsive service in certain cases. Some tenants have praised specific employees like Tonya and Nicole for being prompt, helpful, and treating them with respect and professionalism. For example, a renter was pleased with Tonya\u2019s assistance during their lease and demonstrated a willingness to go above and beyond for clients, providing quick maintenance responses and effective communication. Additionally, some landlords have reported satisfaction with how the company manages their properties, ensuring timely inspections, and providing quality tenant placement. Another landlord mentioned positive experiences over a decade, crediting their assigned agent with managing a complete rebuild process efficiently after significant property damage.</p><p>In other reviews, clients have highlighted the materials provided by Windermere, claiming the properties are managed well in some scenarios. Renters have shared that maintenance issues, when addressed, are resolved swiftly, resulting in renewed satisfaction for tenants who initially faced difficulties. The company\u2019s ability to foster positive relationships is shown as some tenants reported feeling valued and treated like family, with several expressing gratitude for seamless move-ins and stress-free interactions during their stay. The presence of friendly and supportive front desk staff further reinforces the positive remarks, making certain interactions with Windermere Management a pleasure for multiple tenants and landlords alike.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Windermere Management shines in its ability to build strong tenant and landlord relationships through dedicated team members who deliver excellent service experiences. Many reviews consistently highlight the company's proficiency in handling maintenance promptly, with mentions of exceptional staff members like Cody repairing properties efficiently and with positive attitudes. These instances suggest Windermere's commitment to tenant satisfaction. Moreover, the company\u2019s effort to assist tenants navigating particular challenges, such as sourcing a new refrigerator during a critical period, underscores the responsibility and empathy shown by select employees. This level of service fosters trust and loyalty, making clients feel appreciated and attended to throughout their renting journey.</p><p>There are instances where Windermere has gone beyond basic property management duties, helping landlords navigate complicated scenarios smoothly. For example, Windermere staff assisted a landlord with a damaged property, providing insightful support and consistent follow-up during a three-month reconstruction period. Despite the market\u2019s high demand and the complexity of tenant placement, specific agents have distinguished themselves by finding suitable tenants promptly, garnering appreciation from landlords. Furthermore, renters praised Nicole for her attentiveness, creating a seamless rental experience that was both accommodating and rewarding. Overall, these experiences indicate that when Windermere's team excels, tenants and landlords alike are left with a deep sense of satisfaction and peace of mind.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite some positive feedback, Windermere Management has faced criticism about inconsistency and communication issues. Clients have reported frustrations over prolonged response times, with many former tenants highlighting significant delays in addressing maintenance requests. A common complaint is that property issues such as mold, faulty appliances, and needed repairs linger for weeks or even months before receiving attention. Renters often found themselves having to follow up multiple times before any action was taken, undermining their confidence in the management's efficiency. Furthermore, the company's communication practices also seem to falter in billing and rental processes. Customers have expressed dissatisfaction with being charged for issues not of their making, such as pre-existing property damage that was dismissed during the move-in but later billed upon move-out.</p><p>Negative experiences extend to the application process and contractual dealings, which a number of users found lacking in transparency. Tenants and applicants have voiced grievances about being misled during the application phase, with scenarios where their applications were rejected after costly submissions without clear explanations. There are claims of discrimination and lack of courtesy, particularly concerning rental qualifying criteria and customers being inadequately informed about the status of their applications. Renters have shared accounts of abrupt deposit deductions with minimal justification and have also perceived discrepancies in lease agreements, leading to unexpected charges and disputes that the management did not resolve satisfactorily. These issues have resulted in negative perceptions among many clients who feel undermined by Windermere\u2019s operational inconsistencies.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Windermere Management's approach reportedly escalates to egregious levels of dissatisfaction among some renters and landlords, leading to accusations of unethical business practices. Many reviews cite instances of the management's dismissiveness towards tenant rights and severe lapses in service that contribute to hostile living environments. Examples include severe maintenance issues that pose health hazards, such as untreated black mold and unsafe structural conditions within rented units. In a striking case, a tenant continued facing administrative oversight and inadequate response to a reported mold problem, leading to significant personal distress and health concerns. Other experiences involve allegations of predatory practices, such as withholding security deposits without valid justification or charging exorbitant fees for minor repairs.</p><p>Particularly disturbing accounts delve into alleged discriminatory behaviors during the rental application process, describing the property management as uncooperative and unaccommodating toward specific demographic groups. Spiraling hostilities between management and tenants are underscored by complaints of verbal abuse from staff, a lack of follow-through on maintenance disputes, and frequent rental increases during financially trying times. Furthermore, property owners have shared their distress over mismanaged properties and recurrent unauthorized entries, leaving them unable to rely on Windermere for adequate property care. These severe criticisms paint a challenging picture of a company struggling with transparency and accountability, with numerous clients advising potential tenants and landlords to choose alternative property management services to avoid similar detrimental experiences.</p></section>"
