I've seen threats left on apartment doors and cars. I'd love to break my lease because I feel unsafe, but aparently I cannot. Cars get keyed all the time. We aren't allowed to recycle. There isn't enough parking for the residents. By the time I had lived here 3 months, we had gone through 3 different property managers, and none of them seemed to have a clue what they were doing. I cannot stress enough how terrible living here is. I have had 0 positive experiences with property managers or other tenants.",
