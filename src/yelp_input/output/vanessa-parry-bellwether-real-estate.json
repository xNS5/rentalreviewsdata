She made buying our home in the competitive Bellingham market so much easier to navigate!  (Our first offer on our dream house was accepted!) She is always fast at responding to our questions and never hesitated to find more information from the sellers if needed. Overall I highly recommend her as a realtor!",

Provided great advice on all the decisions. Some things we would of never thought about. Was there for us 7 days a week to answer any question or concern. She always listened well and made recommendations with our interests in mind. Bottom line is Vanessa truly cares about her clients and is a knowledgeable realtor.\nLove our new condo!!! She was key in making it happen. We highly recommend Vanessa.",

She is knowledgeable, professional, an incredible communicator, and just an overall fun person to work with.  It feels as if the effort she put into helping us get our dream home is the same effort she would have expended for her own family.  Vanessa, Mike, and the rest of the Bellwether team are absolutely incredible and I would recommend them without hesitation to anyone looking to buy/sell a home.",

        "review": "Vanessa Parry is the best!  We are a coast guard family and got stationed in Bellingham, Wa.  We had to quickly find a home to buy while we were stationed in Northern California.  Vanessa worked hard and fast for us.  I never once felt like she was trying to \"sell\" us on a house that wasn't the perfect fit.  I felt like she totally got what we were looking for and made it happen.  She went to house after house, sending us videos and in depth descriptions as we weren't there to see them in person.  Vanessa is honest, personable and thoughtful.  Not only would I highly recommend Vanessa, I will never go through another agent other than her.  She made our first home buying experience easy and special.  Thank you Vanessa!!!!",
