        "review": "If I could give a 0 I would. The new owners are supposedly a non profit and these are income restricted. So why, in a single increase, was my rent raised by $890!? There is mold everywhere from previous water damage that I wasnt told about. They have garages you can rent. But the terms change based on if management likes you or not. They took mine back for complaints made about things management had told me were fine. When talking to other staff about the complaints I was told those werent the reasons and they wouldnt say more. I wasnt allowed to defend against bogus complaints. I had witnesses and proof but was told by management I dont want to hear it. Visitor parking is almost nonexistent. The few spots there are are only at the front of the complex and residents park their own cars there. Rules and policies are  enforced unfairly depending on whether management likes you or not. Save yourself the headache and find somewhere better. For the rent they charge it isnt worth it.",

        "review": "Great staff and a great location and within walking distance from two shopping centers, post office, restaurants and movie theatres.  The place has been relatively quiet, safe with a good sense of community. At this complex  a tenant may enjoy a, quiet friendly environment, a clubhouse with a gym, laundry, tv room, sauna and heated swimming pool;.   The staff has been keeping the place clean and has been doing an excellent job balancing things during the recent lockdowns.  The apartments are spacious and well maintained.  I have never waited more than one day to have something fixed.  Could use some more blue recycling bins and more guest parking that the existing tenants do not monopolize.",

        "review": "Awful management! I signed a lease to live  here with a roommate I found on Craigslist. Within a month I was being physically  threatened  and it wasn't a safe environment  for me or my puppy. The management knew the situation, but still wouldn't let me cut my lease for another month to get away from my roomate. I had to leave for my safety and the move out fee  (After my roomate got evicted) came out to 1,500 that I have to pay for the month that I didn't even live  there, all they care about is taking your money! And Not to mention the extra charges due  to damage she did to the apartment after I left, and that she stole all my furniture. 2000 all together  for the one month living there in a sketchy  area. Definitely  not worth it highly recommend finding another place",

        "review": "I rented here for six years , the worst place ever ! Don't let the new paint they put on the outside and new windows and cheap blinds make you think they are nice . This new management is the worst. My unit flooded due to an explosion's of the expansion tank. They have 3 days to fix it . By law they have to offer you either another unit or a hotel. They said it would take one week to repair . When I asked the manager what they were doing to fix it they said oh dry the carpets out and your good to go. This happened on the 4th of November 2023. It was still not repaired when I moved out. I gave my notice as I asked them to replace the very old already stretcher out carpet and they had just sent on the 28th of November someone to asses the drywall damage as it had over two inches of water through the entire apartment, it was all declaired damaged so still no repairs. The water was left off and they put up no safety warnings for the water in the unit to stay out or anything. they didn't ask if i had a place to go or if i needed a place they never followed up to let me know what was going on with the unit but had me pay rent for the entire month . I was in it for 4 days . they had heaters running and fans for 24/7 days a week. My power bill never past 100 a month was over 200.00 and they also sent me a notice to inform me my rent was short and that they had added late fees for a unit i couldn't even stay in. i found out from several other tenants that they expansion tanks had also flooded their unit which meant they had never serviced them or done any checks on any of the hot water heaters following several floods continued to let them happen instead of replacing the 1995 expansion tank they had in the units. these by law are to be inspected once a yr. This place is awful the manager wouldn't answer our calls she was screening them. if any others want to come forward about there unit flooding at evergreen ridge i am taking them to small claims court in the process of filing now and have a good strong case for rent deposit as we cleaned without water. also for the cost of the 1000 deposit on new unit and extra expenses for the month i coach surfed. my things were al in my unit ruined and i expect payment for this . I have been stressed out and treated terrible by the management. No notices given when many people entered my apartment and a 48 hour notice must be issued leaving my things exposed and vulnerable to anyone who walked in my unit. Find another place do not move here they are money hungry unkind and  cheap.",

        "review": "This apartment complex is among the best, well managed small community  you can find today. I have lived in many apartment complex's in my time and this is by far the best. The management team was completely professional throughout the application process, yet still welcoming. We ran into a few snags with section 8 housing, but the team there took it in stride. At one point it was uncertain when and even if we were going to move in. Management continued to hold the apartment for us. The complex is also very strict on the rules and regulations of the lease agreement. This was a breath of fresh air for me because being lax leads to no one fallowing the rules. Lastly, the complex is in an ideal location and most areas, as well as the freeway are easily accessible. Renting here has been a pleasant experience thus far!",

        "review": "This apartment complex appears clean and maintained. DO NOT RENT FROM EVERGREEN RIDGE. My husband and I were model tenants--we kept our dog on his lead, cleaned up after him, and always paid rent on time, or within the 5-day window they state in the lease as being acceptable. When we moved out after two years, everything was cleaner than when we found it. We spent hours in there making sure. They not only revoked a free carpet cleaning they granted us after one year (citing that the staff that promised it didn't work there anymore, and that even if we used it, they'd still charge us $150 for a cleaning), but they said it took them four hours to clean it (there was absolutely nothing left to clean). When we applied at our new place, the woman Kelly at the front (so, so rude our whole two years) reported that we let our dog off leash, had smoke damage in the kitchen, and that we were late with the rent three times. Luckily our new property managers are wonderful, and saw it was unsubstantiated. \nThey also sued a neighboring resident whose dryer vent was clogged (outside maintenance's responsibility)--it caught fire, they lost everything, and ended up getting slapped with a $10,000 debt to this place. All of this, and yet they never did a thing about the drug dealers that lived everywhere throughout the complex. \nSave yourself a huge headache, don't rent from them, your rent skyrockets (went from $735 to $810/month for a 2-bed in 1-1/2 years), and they will do absolutely everything to withhold every cent of your deposit.",
