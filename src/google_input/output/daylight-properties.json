      "review": "The staff is great, and the building I lived in (the Leopold building) was wonderful. Jena Curry and the rest managing the Leopold apartments were excellent. They were really quick to respond to whatever issues I had, and were happy to help me figure out some of the more (at first irritating, later charming) features of my room. The Leopold is an old building with a lot of original fixtures, and they preserved as much as they could - if you're willing to trade a bit of modern convenience for some antique charm, then you should rent with these guys. A last note, having just finished an early lease break; I had to move quickly due to family, and the Daylight staff were really quick to help me find a new tenant, get the proper forms filed early, and make my move happen with very little difficulty. I cannot recommend them highly enough",

      "review": "I rented from Daylight for 5 years. It was the best rental experience I've ever had. Whenever I needed anything at all, Daylight responded immediately. The building was safe and secure and clean. The neighbors were cool. The staff were friendly and easy to work with, and the rent was more than fair. When I wanted to upgrade they worked with me to find something in my price range within their other properties and though I didn't end up changing units, I appreciated their effort. I will miss my cute little apartment. It was a very special place. I would have stayed there forever if I didn't buy a house.",

Prices were fair and staff were friendly, I was given prompt communication about inspections/constructions and had all my needs met. Move out procedures were straight forward and after following them to a T I received my whole deposit back. Would definitely rent from again.",
