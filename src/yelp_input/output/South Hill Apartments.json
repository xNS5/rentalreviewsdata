      "review": "To start off, the Office Staff is incredibly unprofessional. The assistant manager has been quite difficult to work with. She never remembers who I am when I walk through the door. If I am living at the complex she works at, I feel as though it might be important to know who your tenants are and what they look like. Her emails and responses to issues I have had have been very out of line. She is very disorganized and unprofessional. \n\nOn another note, the maintenance staff could use a little work. They are constantly shutting off the water or doing renovations to the apartment. It is always one thing after another, and I do not feel at home.\n\nThe parking lot has been an ongoing issue for me for quite a while. Several months ago, I had to be rushed to the emergency room on a Sunday. I was there for several hours. My boyfriend was the one who took me. When we got back to my complex he parked in the parking lot to immediately get me inside. He was taking care of me the rest of the night, in the morning when he remembered he needed to move his car (roughly around 9AM) he found his car had been towed. After just getting out of the hospital I had to drive him to pick up his car. The first warning he received was on a weekend which, when I moved in, I was told specifically by the office staff that guests could park in the parking lot on weekends. To give perspective, the parking lot is huge and is rarely ever full. Now, because of this, my family members and friends do not feel comfortable coming to my apartment complex in fear their car will receive a warning sticker, or get towed.\n\nThe buildings (Manor and Terrace) are incredibly old and falling apart. The pipes are in pretty bad shape and there always seems to be something wrong. As I have said above, there is constant maintenance, so when they need to enter the apartments as much as they have been, I feel as though it becomes an invasion of privacy. In one instance there was a notice on the door saying they needed everyone to move the furniture away from the heaters so they could turn the heat on. So, I moved all the furniture out of the way and they never came in to the apartment. I called the office staff and all they said to me was \"yeah we didn't get to it, not sure when we will.\" It was already November here in Washington and that will make any room without heat almost unbearable.\n\nIf you want to feel at home, do not home here. I will never recommend this complex to anyone.",

      "review": "This place likes to try to come off as a small company, but it could not be farther from the truth, if you are one day late they give u 3 days to pay or vacate. I can understand that in some situations, but there has also been time when I prepaid rent months in advance so you think I would get a smidge of leeway. The maintenance people are nice, but I am not a fan of how this place is run (it doesn't help that every time I need to talk to the manage they are out during business hours), if this continues I will be looking for a new place when my lease ends, and I know I am not the only person here that is thinking that way.\nThis place isn't all bad, rent is reasonable, close to WWU, and downtown, and while I am not a fan of their policies the management is a little friendly.",

      "review": "South Hill Apartments treated me and my roommate with disrespect in regard to health hazards, privacy, simple maintenance requests, and human decency over the year I lived there. We moved in July 2016 and stayed for the one year lease. I chose to move at the end of the year and my roommate took over the lease for one month. He then was given an unreasonable termination of housing. To begin, we complained about bad maintenance and mismanagement using every acceptable avenue and request. I never belligerently complained or harassed the on-site personnel but they gave me a wide berth the second I began to note odd things. First, it was an infestation of ants that then continued off and on for over six months.  Then, it was questions about seemingly unending maintenance in an adjacent unit, so loud it was distrusting our ability to work, sleep, and study. If you want a legal explanation, feel free to reach out to me, because I have a long list of recorded problems. But on a personal level, I never felt comfortable at South Hill. Once, I walked out of the bathroom to maintenance staff standing in the living room, not caring that I was given no notice. After I complained, the head of maintenance, Jeff, would suddenly glare and mumble when he saw me. Once, in the laundry room, he side-eyed me while talking to another tenant about football and how some people annoy the hell out of him and then he switched the subject to his guns that he owns. (Note the moment he looked at me). It was just weird. The two on-site managers were ignorant of their rights as middlemen and help for tenants, at best, but that might be giving them too much credit. As often as we had to wait for exterminators, or scream to order lunch over the sound of a jackhammer, or tip toe through piles of dead ants, it's insulting that we were shrugged off and treated like children. They have condemned our unit, which is the reason given to my roommate for terminating his tenancy. \"The problems you cannot live with will not change and this unit is not fit to inhabit, so you have until the end of the month.\" If you rent unit 107, we paid $895/month for that place and it is not considered fit for human habitation, so be sure to ask if they really remedied the place before you move in and adopt our issues. If you expect respect, don't live here. If you expect basic human decency, apply elsewhere.",
