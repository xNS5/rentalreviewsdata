Then they were billed for all sorts of \"damages\" and cleaning fees.   The guy then was very condescending when talking to them and finally agreed to no additional charges but they still lost their security deposit even though there was no \"damage\" to the unit.",

        "review": "To be completely honest, this company strictly only cares about getting your money. They usually make it off of college kids, I assume it's easier to not get as much backfire from a bunch of kids who don't know what they're doing really. We received an invoice for an extra 4 or 5 hundred dollars for \"extra water usage\" one month. We didn't believe it so we paid for someone to come out and of course they had a leak that they hadn't bothered to even check before asking us for more money and getting mad when we asked questions. That's just the beginning. Do not trust this company",

        "review": "So awful. We were told first come first serve with applications. Two weeks later we get a call they are showing the house to a bunch of people and that they hadn't even looked at our application. They basically had all of us at the house showing fight over who could get a hold down the quickest and it was so unprofessional. The current tenants were being kicked out early because they didnt want to prelease another year when they were told it would be month to month when they moved in. They screw everyone over and charge you up the ass for ever mark you leave on a property. Even the actual home owners of this home hate having to be legally bound to them. \n\nGo to son-rise or landmark if you want a good experience and home.",

        "review": "If I can help it, I will never rent from or use MMRA Real Estate Management company (or any of its affiliates - Misty Mountain Reality, Weichert Reality) ever again.  I have never had a worst experience with a landlord ever.\n\nThis is why-  \n* The unit was filthy when I moved in, yet they charged hundreds of dollars to clean an already clean unit when I moved out.  \n* The rent was significantly increased every year.\n* Their management was condescending and rude.  Our experience was so bad that it made my wife cry.\n* Upon move out they deducted a significant fee from my security deposit to remove their own equipment. These were items that they had left in my unit after repairs were completed months before.  Adding insult to injury they also charged me a hefty fee for generating an invoice for removing their own equipment from my unit.\n* Because I refuse to sign a non-defamation waiver, they will not return my remaining security deposit.  MMRA acknowledges that this is money I am owed; they just are refusing to return my money unless I keep quiet about them.\n* I had to buy my own mailbox keys from the post office, yet MMRA tried to charge me for the key deposit.\n* MMRA charged a nonrefundable move/ in move out fee of several hundred dollars. This is on top of a big security deposit.\n* In my opinion, lease requirements prevent you from ever really making it a home - you can't have more than three small potted plants, and no pictures can be hung on the wall using anything more than a thumb tack. Our family pictures and paintings sat in a closet for three years.\n* Required routine outdoor maintenance were not performed without complaints to management. (I at my own expense kept the property fully maintained and weed free, the neighboring tenant had to demand that MMRA remove the large weeds and overgrowth present when they moved in).\n\nIf someone does decide to rent or buy from these people, I recommend that they read any documents very closely, be prepared to fight for anything you need or are owed, and based on my experience, don't expect to get much of your security deposit back.",

        "review": "After consigning for my son & dealing with no notice of charges for repairs, I received a letter that I was being sent to collections. \nThe office manager Serina was not helpful & indeed combative & hung up on me when I requested her managers name & number. Upon calling back I was put on hold by Tyrell 3x's & told that the manager was first out of town then unable to take calls & I was again refused a name or phone number.\n\nI was sent invoices for charges which included poorly installed toilets & closet flashing which led to further damages!!!\n\nDo not give any of these people your hard earned money!! If you kids a student at Western, talk them out of renting through this agency!! They will bill you for anything they can get away with!!!\n\nIf I could give a negative star I would!!!!",

Never have met such rude and unhelpful people in my life.",

        "review": "I was a tenant with mmra for about a year and a half. The move in was easy, we took over a lease from the previous tenant, filled out a transfer form and that was it, I was told to pay the previous tenant X amount for the deposit, which I did.\nWe called a few times over our stay to have things fixed, like heating and a fireplace that would not turn off. All calls where ignored, we were told several times someone would be out, never happened. \nWhen we finally decided to move out we got the packet for cleaning and followed it to the letter. We documented everything, pictures of every room, door ect. When I got my deposit back, it was short about $250 for \"cleaning,\" a pest control fee, and a couple other random fees.\nI contacted the office to try and get some answers, 3 calls later And being told I would be contacted by someone, I called back and spoke with the assistant property manager. She said nothing noteworthy was found during the cleaning and that it's a standard cleaning. I sent her the pictures of everything, and she agreed with me that it looked very clean and she would speak with the property manager about it. I received an email that said \"the charges stand\". I called back and was told ide be contacted, nobody returns my calls.\nSo essentially they stole money to pay for cleaning that I was told by them didn't need to be done, they provided NOTHING stating what was wrong and REFUSED to allow me to walk with them during the move out inspection. Sounds fishy right? Well I was also charged for a \"pest cleaning,\" I for one would have sued to get out of a lease if there where pests in the property. They said it was because the PREVIOUS tenants had pets, something they never bothered to tell me, what would have happened if I had a pet allergy? They wouldn't have cared, they only want your money, I'm posting this because I don't want others to get ripped off like me.",

        "review": "This management group looked and sounded like the real deal: business suits, all the right answers to your questions, setting the tenants at ease. Their price tag gave me sticker shock, but you get what you pay for, right? Wrong! A careful look at their contract gave me cause for concern. Although they were very reassuring with their responses to those concerns, I pointed out that the contract itself was not so reassuring. I was told that in three days I would receive a return call to see if my two biggest concerns could be addressed via wording changes or addendums to the contract. Twelve days went by with no response. My call on day twelve was not returned. What happened to professionalism? How about a simple email: \"I'm sorry, but we were not able to make the contract changes you were hoping for. Please let us know if you are still interested in signing with us.\" I am stunned by MMRA's utter lack of respect for potential clients. My contract concerns turned out to be a blessing. Because of them, I learned that professionalism, as with beauty, is often only skin deep.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite numerous negative reviews, it's worth noting that some users haven't reported any positive experiences explicitly with Misty Mountain Real Estate Management. Without positive details, it becomes challenging to provide a balanced viewpoint in this section of the article, and thus, it serves as a reminder of the power and impact of customer service and satisfaction in the property management industry.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>In the instance of property management, excellence typically manifests in professional communication, efficient problem resolution, and positive tenant-landlord relationships. Unfortunately, the absence of great experiences within user reviews for Misty Mountain Real Estate Management indicates an area ripe for improvement and underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a reputable service in the real estate sector.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>User reviews describe experiences of inadequate communication and perceived unfairness in charges. For instance, several former tenants reported being billed for damages and cleaning fees they disagreed with, indicating a potential inconsistency in the handling of security deposits and move-out charges. Another user recounted being charged a substantial extra fee for \"extra water usage\" due to a leak that the company failed to identify proactively, causing financial distress and frustration.</p><p>There are also complaints about disorganization and unprofessionalism in rental processes. One reviewer describes a chaotic showing where potential renters were pitted against each other on a first-come-first-serve basis without prior review of applications. Additionally, another review highlights efforts to bill tenants for items left over from repairs and difficulties faced when seeking managerial assistance, suggesting opportunities for operational and customer service improvements for Misty Mountain Real Estate Management.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>User experiences reveal concerning allegations of neglect and disrespect, which are cause for serious concern. One particular narrative tells of a family being charged for the removal of the company's own equipment left behind after repairs, compounded by a fee for the creation of the invoice itself. The same user claims an unreturned security deposit contingent upon the signing of a non-defamation agreement. Issues such as these, along with accusations regarding mold in properties and ignored maintenance requests, paint an \"ugly\" picture of a company's practices and values, highlighting the gravity of trust and transparency in property management.</p></section>"
