Everything from the screening process to the move-in to the pet approval was handled quickly and easily, and the facilities are really nice.\n\nNow, this is 2020, and some of the onsite amenities are sadly unavailable, but they're doing the responsible thing which I can respect.",

        "review": "Amenities are not available due to what ever excuse they come up with month to month. I lived there a year and only got to use the pool/hot tube twice. Your heat bill will be $200.00 in winter, and the windows will condensate and freeze over and then mold. You will sweat to death in summer because you can not use a window AC. Washer and dryer is mini so power bill will also be high all year, due to having to do multiple loads and the appliances are outdated. If you are a lower unit you will hear everything from your neighbors upstairs. I mean everything and it will startle you out of bed at night as if they will fall through the ceiling. You will hear the neighbors toilet flush every single time. My neighbor used the toilet a lot! They won't properly clean the apartment before you move in, if you have a cat or dog on the lease , they will keep your entire deposit claiming the entire carpet in the unit needed to be replaced due to urine ,only proof of their false claim is a black light they apparently use after you move out but not when you move in.... You will be refused a walkthrough on exit and the the carpet cleaners are also, the same person who replaces carpet.. even though they never cleaned carpets before you moved in and will not show proof when you ask. To top it off you will be forced to pay an added amount to cover all the cost of replacing carpet after they already kept 1500.00 or be reported to collections. The time and cost of fighting them in court is costly and time consuming.",

I have NEVER been treated like this and I am so disappointed.  They claim there were traces of urine through most of the living room and dining room. They provided where this supposedly was and all of the areas were covered by my furniture and my cat would NOT have had access to them.  My cat NEVER peed on the carpet. She is a house cat and they are very picky.  She always uses her litter box.  Wish I could post without any stars!",

        "review": "My wife and I have lived at Canterbury Court on and off since 2001.  Our last move out was on December 29, 2013 just over a month ago after living there for eight years.  We expected to pay a reasonable cleaning fee as we have paid before in our other two move outs.  Unfortunately this did not happen this time.  We were charged an excessive cleaning fee which was very disappointing but we paid it and wrote a letter explaining our disappoint but no one has responded to our letter to see how we could improve this issue.  I know there are new owners which then caused a change in management at Canterbury Court which probably explains the reduction in customer care.  Before these changes took place we have written positive reviews in the past of the customer care that we received from the former owners and managers.  Obviously from our long stay at this site it has been a place that we have enjoyed living.  With the new direction owner/management has taken Canterbury Court  is not the great experience that we came to expect.",

        "review": "Don't live here. Price is too high, the pool/spa area is basically a lie, and management is very dishonest.\n\nI lived here for ~2.5 years. In that time, I think I had 5 months of pool access. It was the last pool to open after covid, then they closed it for 6 months for hvac repairs, then it took them another month to 'balance the chemicals'. Literally any excuse they can come up with to keep it closed and keep costs down. The hottub was closed for more than that, and the sauna literally never worked the entire time i lived there.\n\nMaintenance took a full year to replace a part on my stove which was a fire hazard. After they finally did, I could see the part said 'too big' in large letters on it... they knew it didn't fit and used it anyways... TWICE their maintenance guys 'fixed' things in my apartment and ended up damaging my property. They also hid the things they damaged so that they could get out before I noticed.\n\nWhen I moved out, they blamed me for the previous tenant's pet's urine stains. They sent a little map of the stains, most were under furniture that hadn't moved since I moved in. When I asked to see the map from the previous tenant, they stopped responding to my messages. Typical scummy landlord behaviour.\n\nOh and Dear Current Tenants,\nThose obnoxious magnetic extinguishers hanging over your stove? Those aren't up to code. There isn't enough clearance between them and the stove top. Pretty sure you can just take those down if you want. (This from one of their staff.)\n\nA shame really, because the property itself is quite nice.",

The apartments are nice and the maintenance is good and are usually really quick to fix things, but the rent is really high and keeps going up, and they charge for amenities they can hardly even keep up on. My partner and I like to go for swims everyday but they have the pool room closed half the week for maintenance and the clubhouse and gym are so uncomfortably hot its practically unbearable to even use it. Im extremely frustrated that we are paying for extra amenities that we cant even use because theyre either closed half the time or they cant figure out a way to better climate control the main building.

        "review": "Lived in this complex for two years with my SO. We loved it at first, 1295 for a one bedroom one bath on the top floor. The maintenance was usually pretty prompt and we enjoyed the spaciousness of our unit. Over time we noticed a lot of rules enforced by the property managers that were unnecessary. One is that youre not allowed to park backwards in a parking space. Not allowed to have bird feeders? We had one up for over a year before they told us to take it down. It just got ridiculous. Also due to covid they had the clubhouse closed and inaccessible. Once they finally opened it, they were once again strict about unnecessary rules and the clubhouse was always extremely hot and uncomfortable inside.\n\nLastly they have a very non secure process for turning in monthly rent. They told us to slide it through a small crack in the door of the office. We were told this was secure. Our last rent payment they lost our money order and we had to pay an extra 400$. Turns out, it was in their office inside an umbrella the whole time. Though I know thats no ones fault, it feels like there could be a better, more secure system.\n\nAnd they took our entire security deposit and then some.  I suppose this is what you get when you live in an apartment. Take what i say with a grain of salt. The ducks are cute and the pond is very serene.",

The grounds are lovely and well kept, with ornamental trees and shrubs. It is surprising how quiet and peaceful it is for it's proximity to the airport.  Management is excellent and there is no waiting whether you need a small repair, or a new appliance. I have not even mentioned the wetland that the apartments are built around, or the winding boardwalk that crosses it, and the ducks who inhabit it. And I have also not mentioned the indoor heated swimming pool, hot tub and sauna, or the well equipped exercise room. It is a great place to live!!",

State law says you can't smoke on the balconies, and I support that law 1000%. Postmarks on mail returning your deposit money often occur the day after the mail is actually dropped off. Rents in the area are skyrocketing, so they have to raise the rent every year to keep most of the druggies and losers out. If they didn't, the place would be a slum, which it currently is not. All in all, it's been a good place to live, the rent remains fairly priced, the neighbors are decent, and the place is maintained way better than most. Reasonable people with realistic expectations will like the place just fine, and I recommend Canterbury to that kind of renter. I've been satisfied here for more than two years now.",

        "review": "My wife and I lived in this apartment complex for 6+ years. We brought home 2 babies to this home. When we first moved in, the original owners and management were fantastic. We never had a single issue.\n\nFrom my understanding, the apartment complex, or property management company changed hands a few times. The maintenance manager changed jobs, and the grounds went down hill from there. The buildings were not cleaned and maintained on a regular basis. We had to fight to get them to come clean and pressure wash the stairs and hand rails. If an appliance in the apartment broke, it was almost impossible to get them to come fix it. We had birds nests in the outside vents for the bathroom fan, and the dryer exhaust. Our dryer was not drying properly, and had to run it through many cycles to get clothes dry and they just didn't care. They just told us, \"yep, birds build nests every spring...\" If that's the case, why don't you be proactive and plan to clean the vents to prevent that from happening!\n\nRent gets raised every year, and not just 25 or 50 dollars. Our rent one year went from 900.00 to 1075.00 the next year! That is just one example of the raise in rent! They always told us they compared to similar housing and apartments in the area, to justify them raising the rent. Yet we found a place that is 10 years newer and almost 400 sqft bigger, for the same price we were currently paying.\n\nWhen we moved out we spent lots of time cleaning the whole apartment so that we could get our complete deposit back. We knew that there was a deadline for the apartment complex to return our deposit to us, or to provide us with an invoice as to why we would not be getting a deposit back. I waited until the next day (Tuesday) after the deadline to contact them when we had not received anything in the mail. I was informed that it had been mailed out the Friday before, and we should see it in the next day or two. I waited until Thursday, and when we had still not received the deposit, i called them again and they confirmed our new address and said they would check with the accountant and make sure it hadn't been cashed. Seeing as how we were very short on money, from just making the move, I asked them to put a stop payment on the check and issue a new check, and that i would pick it up at the office. They refused to do so, stating that it take 3-4 weeks to issue a stop payment and issue a new check. It doesn't take that long to do all that! My wife decided to call the office and check on it, and they told her it was sent out on Monday. I decided to stop in to the office and talk to them. In the office they told me it was sent out on Monday as well. We ended up seeing the deposit the following day on Friday...WITH A POST MARK STAMP OF TUESDAY(one day after the deadline, two days later then they originally told me, and a day later then what they changed their story to). They also charged us an additional 105.00 for additional cleaning in the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nI would not recommend these living quarters to anyone",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>        <p>This article is generated by ChatGPT and is intended only to be a tool to help individuals find a property management company or rental property. The summary provided is based on user reviews and is designed to reflect a sampling of both positive and negative experiences at Canterbury Court Apts. The article does not include identifiable information, and the specific examples cited are meant to illustrate broader themes observed among the reviews.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>Good</h2>        <p>Several residents at Canterbury Court Apts have expressed positive experiences, particularly with individual staff members. One user review highlighted the effortless move-in assistance and the quick handling of administrative processes such as screening and pet approval. The review also complimented the quality of the facilities. Another user had high praise for the property manager, commenting on her helpfulness and knowledge. Some residents have found the neighborhood to be quiet and private, and appreciated the prompt and effective work of the maintenance team.</p>    <p>Additionally, the setting of Canterbury Court Apts was described as pleasant by some reviewers. They mentioned the beauty of the grounds with ornamental trees and tranquil ponds, which echoes a sentiment of peace and quietude within the community. Despite other complaints, factors like a good location and the presence of community ducks were noted as appealing aspects of the property, adding a unique charm to the residential experience.</p>  </Section>  <section>          <h2>Great</h2>        <p>The amenities at Canterbury Court Apts, when available, have received acclaim from several reviewers. Descriptions of an indoor heated swimming pool, a hot tub, and a sauna cater to the residents' recreational needs. A well-equipped exercise room is an added bonus for those seeking fitness within the apartment complex. The allure of these amenities seems to provide a significant boost to tenant satisfaction and contributes positively to the living experience.</p>    <p>There are also reports of a hands-on management team that typically responds well to requests for repairs or new appliances. The presence of an attentive and responsive management team can significantly enhance the day-to-day living experience for tenants. Some residents appreciate the seclusion and tranquility offered by the property's landscaping and the care taken to cultivate a serene environment for its residents.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>Bad</h2>        <p>On the other side of the spectrum, some user reviews reflect dissatisfaction with various aspects of living at Canterbury Court Apts. Issues with noise pollution, particularly from upstairs neighbors, have been a recurring theme in user reviews. Residents on lower floors report being disturbed by the sound of footsteps and other activities from above, which can be jarring and affect the quality of their living experiences. Additionally, the policy enforcement on parking, and the ban on small butane grills and bird feeders, has also been mentioned as a point of frustration, with some deeming these measures as overreach by the property management.</p>    <p>Discontent has also been directed at the amenities, specifically regarding their availability. Residents have criticized the unreliable opening times of the pool and recreation spaces, with some users mentioning the pool area being frequently closed for maintenance without proper notification. Furthermore, some residents have felt that the amenities are not adequately maintained, pointing out that the sauna, for example, was not operational for extended periods, which diminished their overall satisfaction with the property.</p>  </section>  <section>          <h2>Ugly</h2>        <p>More troubling are the accounts of safety issues and alleged property mismanagement. One user detailed a harrowing event involving injury due to poorly maintained exterior stairs. Despite reasonable expectations of maintenance and repair from the property management, this review, along with others, highlights a perceived neglect in addressing well-being and safety concerns, which is particularly distressing for residents who have suffered as a result.</p>    <p>Perhaps most concerning is the frequent mention of financial grievances. Several users allege that the security deposits were not returned due to claims of damage, which the tenants dispute. Users have described this practice as dishonest, with accusations of the management being overly stringent or unreasonable in their assessments. This has led to instances where individuals felt compelled to battle these charges in court. The handling of these incidents and communication surrounding them has contributed to a significant amount of discontent among past residents, as reflected in the user reviews.</p>  </section></article>"
