      "review": "Western Washington University students should beware of this landlord.  Suggest you stay away \nfrom this apartment.  Rent somewhere else; but if you do choose to rent at Dex, note well:\n\nThis landlord charges a lot of dubious opportunistic fees and a one-month security deposit  PER TENANT when applying for an apartment lease.  A lot of money.\n\nThe landlord will unilaterally withhold some or all of your security deposit money for cleaning and painting when you and your roommates vacate.  This is irregular and is wrong.  Security deposits can only be held for damage to the apartment and are NOT nonrefundable.  \n\nMake sure you document the condition of the apartment before taking occupancy.\n\nThe apartment was not painted when we occupied.  The landlord attempted to charge us for painting the apartment.  We had to PROVE that the apartment was not painted when we entered.  How many times does this landlord take advantage of students and gets away with charging unwitting students erroneously?!!  BEWARE.\n\nThe landlord failed and refused to present an invoice for cleaning charges.  This is a violation of the WA State Landlord and Tenants Act.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and live elsewhere.",
