        "review": "I would LOVE to have a conversation with the people who built this place because, its done horribly. If you have a guest over and they need to use the restroom, well guess what they need to walk through the apartment into YOUR ROOM to get to a bathroom. Dont even get me started on the trim of this place, haha I can literally stick my whole finger in the trim. (Thats where the ants come into play) yes ANTS. The apartment complex does nothing about the infestation but gives you a spray can. Basically saying youll need to figure it out yourself. OH and to add if any of your lights go out YOU have to buy new ones, not the complex, and theyll even tell you it doesnt matter what the wattage is.",

        "review": "We lived at Brampton for 5 years before buying our house. It was affordable and a good place to call home. Even with the changes in management throughout the years, they always answered all of our concerns or questions straight away and acted on it if needed. The apartments are pretty old, but the maintenance workers are nice and good at fixing things. As far as loud annoying neighbors, you will find that in any apartment building; management was always quick to respond on any noise complaints wed put in. You will need a portable AC unit in the summer, we had one in the living room and one in the bedroom and it was more than enough to keep us cool through the warmer months. If you have a dog, the place is very pet friendly as long as you leash them and pick up after them. They were also very reasonable with what they charged us for move out fees after half a decade of wear and tear of the place. Overall Id definitely recommend!",

        "review": "Where to begin. There's a lot of open space in these units, you're able to pretty much lay out your living area however you want. Though, it is an odd design choice to have the bathroom only accessible through the bedroom. If you like mirrors amd gold trim you'll be in heaven, many of the walls have sliding mirror doors which open up to a surprising amount of space.\n\nRent seems fair enough, but I was only there for nine months so my rent never had a chance to raise.\n\nI can't recommend anyone live here unless you have too. I turned my heater off in the middle of winter... It was still insufferably warm due to some of the worse insulation I have ever experienced. With only one window that opened in the apartment, even with an AC unit and several fans, the apartment would get up to 85 degrees.  I had my AC running through September and October it got that hot.\n\nIt also took management upwards of two months to replace stairs that had rotten through and were unsafe.\n\nThere's a large transient community in the parking lot next door. No big deal normally, but I'd find piles of puke in the parking lot from time to time.\n\nOverall, good learning experience.",

        "review": "I used to live here for a year and at first I thought it was a good apartment complex....for my first time living on my own....and wow was I wrong. During the winter, fall and spring the apartment was pretty comfortable overall with just two box fans, one oscillating fan and one exhaust fan. But as the summer came around, the fans didnt do anything to cool down the inside of the apartment, it was so bad that I had to leave my apartment for days and stay at Starbucks or the library to stay cool.\n\nThis is unacceptable with how horribly insulated the apartment is, I feel like I could have gotten heat stroke if I wasnt careful, things didnt start to fully cool off until 2 in the morning and then I was able to finally sleep comfortably. Whenever I had called for help on something that wasnt working, it took about two weeks until someone could finally come and fix, dish washer, dryer/washer, etc. Also certain dogs arent allowed here, puppies/Pitbulls/German Shepards/ Rottweilers and mixed breeds but I saw some of these breeds before, management here I thought was strict and on top of making sure everyone living here is accommodated, guess thats not true.",

        "review": "The application process is a bit antiquated and slow-moving.  However, the lease agreement is very fair, and the month-to-month arrangement is tough to beat.\nWe were in a 2BR 1BA top-floor unit and moved to a 2BR 2BA ground floor unit. Both units were nicely laid out. The flooring, appliances and counters are all base-level, but that's to be expected at this price point.  The complex is clean, and the landscaping is well kept. Residents receive parking passes. The parking is unassigned and can be somewhat tight. This is a dog-friendly complex, and that's apparent from the number of dogs being walked on the property at regular intervals. However, all of the dogs here seem well behaved and are relatively quiet.",

        "review": "With all the pros and cons, it is fair. Rent was raised a few hundred dollars by the time I left. I previously gave a 4 star rating because of being a dog owner in Bellingham (difficult to rent in town), month to month, and the resources all around you. The old owners were great and the new owners somehow lost a lot of records.\n\nI lowered it to 2 star because when moving out near the end of last year, I hired a cleaner and spent two days deep cleaning. I'm not a messy person, neither my roommates. We deep cleaned to make sure we got our deposit back. The office woman had mentioned how not to vacuum because they will vacuum anyways, and we wouldn't get charged for it. I knew I should have asked for it in writing, that was my mistake. I deep cleaned everything, every corner, washed the walls so I could get my deposit back. I lost my deposit of $700 and they charged us another $200+, I wasted my last days cleaning when they took my money anyways.\n\nPrevious post that was still my honest experience living their: They are pet friendly, my dogs love the walk I take them around here and it's close to Birchwood park. If my car broke down today I could walk to get my groceries, go see an optometrist, clean my car and get it repaired at the shop close by and eat at a restaurant within less than a 5 min walk. Or go shopping at the mall and walk back 20-30 min.  I also donate a lot of old belongings to the salvation army nearby and bike around the plaza parking lot. 7/11 is nearby for my 3 am snack and I really appreciate the little things, even the gas station SUPER close before I do my road trips.\n\nThe reason it's not a higher star is not much of a view, not the nicest neighborhood and occasional homeless persons every now and then. If I had children I wouldn't want them cursing the way they do around these side walks. New management is not bad I got a new toilet with a button woo hoo lol\n\nAdvice living here: Ask for anything they say in writing. Everything, to watch your own back. Also, keep a second record of everything. I was not a bad tenant, we were the tenants who shooed off a lot of the homeless people and called the cops when they would scream and chant at 2 am. That leads to my last advice, do not be afraid to call the cops if you see anything strange or pestering in the neighborhood. Because if you don't, these people will come back to bother you.",

        "review": "Seriously.... the longer you stay here the worse it gets... We moved here into a two bed two bath with rent at $985 a month and we were going to lease again despite the neighbor issues because the property itself wasn't trashy, but they raised the rates to 1180$ a month!\n\nIt states in the lease that the property is /federal/. We have a bad streak of bad neighbors breaking rules. Families leaving piles of garbage in front of the doors and one neighbor blasting a bass subwoofer at all hours of the day and sneaking their dogs and psycho girlfriend in to live full time. These people got evicted, fortunately, but not the most recent downstairs neighbors: They smoked cigarettes and weed hourly and I overheard them throwing the beer cans into the little river in our backyard. I complained to the landlord but they couldn't control these college kids, apparently! My room always smelled like smoke if I kept my screen door open.... Which I did - especially in the summer - because it was the only \"window\" in the apartment. This lasted all year, man!\n\nI wanted to live here because it was strict, which is what I desired because I don't drink or smoke and I sleep early, and I felt like the owners would care to uphold these rules but NOPE.",
