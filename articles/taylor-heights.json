        "review": "I wish I could give zero stars, they never answer their phone, that'd be fine if they responded to emails but they don't do that either. They always have an excuse as to why they can't answer the phone or why they didn't respond to emails but how can you have the same excuse every time. Once is okay, twice maybe a coincidence but every single time? That's just their habits at this point, I think I've only got them when I called one time. Going straight to the leasing office is the best way to contact them and they're not even there on time majority of the time and even if they're there, the sign says their open, and their cars are in the parking lot, they have the door locked and don't respond to knocking on the door or phone calls. They say they'll be back at one time and don't return until way past that time. Contacting them is their main issue and also the most important one. All the apartments have different things though we all say the same price. Some have nicer washer dryers, the bathrooms are different the flooring and kitchens are different. If youre going to have different values in each apartment the prices should reflect that or they should all be upgraded the same. Why is the hot water heater in the closet? It takes up half the room for me to put clothes, yet I pay the same price as others with a full closet? It's a nice community of college students but staff even thought theyre doing their best fails miserably when it comes to contacting them.",

        "review": "Andres Antal\n 19 August 2017\nI lived in Taylor Heights, one of the buildings managed by Pacific Living Properties (WWU Living), from Summer 2015 to Summer 2017.\n\nI would rate 4.5 stars if I could.\n\nDon't pay attention to reviews prior to September 2016; a different company, Painless Properties, managed the property during that time.\n\nSince Pacific Living Properties (PLP) took over, they invested a lot of time and money into the property. Unfortunately, a lot of residents, myself included, had to deal with constant construction, but that has been mostly completed. The property needed the work--BADLY. The previous management let it fall into shambles. Otherwise, it's a pretty good property, and I had an overall positive experience living here.\n\nPros:\n-You're on an individual lease; you don't need to hassle your roommates for rent money.\n-It's the cheapest single lease you will find remotely close to campus.\n-Sufficient parking, it would get tight on Sunday nights during the school year, but I always managed to park on the same block that I lived on.\n-Literally right next to campus\n-The office is located on site, and they are open 7 days a week.\n-The office staff is personable and tries to get to know residents, but I may be biased since I am working here.\n-The leasing office immediately texts you when they receive a package for you\n-Maintenance is prompt with work orders\n-Flat rate utilities\n\nCons:\n-Shared living\n-Random roommates if you don't come with a group--I've had mostly positive experiences\n-WiFi can be spotty in some rooms, but there are workaround. I had my own free modem\n\nFurther notes:\n-Leases generally start in September; if you want a good deal for September, start looking in early Spring\n-The rent may seem high, but they fill quickly--SIGN A LEASE EARLY.\n-In 2017 rooms were completely filled up by mid-August\n-If you want cheap housing, move to the Southwest. $350 a m/o for gorgeous new apartments",

It has been a complete nightmare. I wish I could escape but they lock you under a fascist lease agreement with very little options to get out. This place should honesty be shut down.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>When considering Taylor Heights, some user reviews highlight positive aspects. Several tenants appreciate the property's proximity to campus, which offers a significant convenience for those attending nearby schools. The concept of individual leases is also noted as beneficial, saving tenants from the potential hassles associated with collecting rent from roommates. Moreover, some users have reported that maintenance requests are promptly addressed, and utility costs wrapped into a flat rate can provide easier budget management for residents.</p><p>The presence of an on-site office, open seven days a week, is mentioned as an asset. In a few user reviews, the staff of the leasing office is described as personable, with attempts to build rapport with tenants by getting to know them. Additionally, the communication from the leasing office regarding package deliveries is prompt and appreciated by residents, providing a layer of convenience and service.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Some users have expressed overall satisfaction with their living experience at Taylor Heights. There is acknowledgment in user reviews of the effort and financial investment put forward by the management to improve the property, which had been neglected by previous administrators. Such investments presumably improved the living conditions and could potentially enhance the quality of life for residents. User reviews also mention that despite some drawbacks, the value for the proximity to campus is considered favorable, especially when comparing rental rates in the vicinity.</p><p>From the perspective of some tenants, the property has demonstrated positive attributes such as sufficient parking availability. Despite occasional tight situations, it is remarked that parking can generally be found on the same block as the residence. This aspect is particularly useful for tenants who own vehicles and require consistent access to parking spaces near their homes.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, not all feedback for Taylor Heights is glowing. A common theme among user reviews is the struggle with communication, where several tenants report frustrations over unanswered calls and unresponsive emails. This recurrent issue seems to reflect an area where the property management company fails to meet the expectations of some residents. The inconsistency in the quality and features of apartments despite uniform rent prices also draws criticism, as some tenants face disparities in amenities such as washer/dryers and storage space within their units.</p><p>Parking challenges present another set of issues, as highlighted in one user review which points out the difficulty of using tight parking spaces. Additionally, at least one tenant reported a peculiar and inconvenient placement of the hot water heater in a closet, thereby reducing usable storage space. It's concerns like these that lead to a tarnished reputation, resulting in negative experiences for some residents.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most distressing feedback comes from residents who express an almost complete dissatisfaction with their experience at Taylor Heights. One review notably employs harsh language to convey the severity of disappointment with the staff and management, describing being locked into an overly restrictive lease agreement as 'fascist'. Another resident points out the nuisance of trying to even initiate their tenancy, suggesting initial challenges with the setup process. The lack of an official response to certain critical reviews further feeds into the narrative of a management company potentially neglecting the grievances of their tenants.</p></section>"
