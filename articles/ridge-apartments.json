        "review": "I have just about finished up my lease with The Ridge Bellingham and am sad to go. Many Bellingham renter companies are terrible and scam you for your money, but when renting with the private owner Lauren, I have had no issues. She replies very quickly with any questions and is very understanding. She has been patient and kind even when I was having trouble deciding if I was going to stay another year changing my mind back and fourth. That is an extremely frustrating thing for me to do, but she did not show one ounce of annoyance with me. Everything in these apartments were new as it was jusy built and we were the first renters. Very good price for what you get. Anything I needed fixed, she got someone in and out right away. My favorite thing is the soft close drawers and cabinets. If I could stay another year I would do it.",

        "review": "From last October, until a few weeks ago, I have had the pleasure of living at the Ridge. Although the common space is decidedly on the small side, the rooms are unusually spacious to make up for it: I comfortably fit my full-sized bed frame, a medium desk, and a full-sized, tall bookshelf in my room comfortably, and the space never felt cramped. The kitchen features reasonable amounts of counterspace and cupboard storage, as well as a full-sized fridge. The high ceilings, shiny new appliances, lovely marbled countertops and wooden floors, in conjunction with the complex's proximity to Sehome Village and major highways make this a *fabulous* and cost-effective alternative to dorm living! Your grocery store, cell phone carrier (T-Mobile), internet provider (Xfinity in Haggen), and Dollar Tree, to name a few, are all a ten minute walk away. Frankly, it's more difficult to name any kind of store that *isn't* within arms reach! Convenient on site parking is available for a small fee ($30 at the time of this writing).\n\nAlthough the property's condition, convenience, and interior aesthetics are prime selling points in and of themselves, one would be remiss to ignore the effective, gracious, and responsive management provided by Ridge Bellingham's own Lauren Kramer: In a fashion so unlike any other management company l've encountered, she will actually respond to your maintenance requests, set crystal-clear expectations about move-out cleanups, enforce parking permits, address noise complaints, and make a reasonable effort to ensure your compatibility with any roommates (so reasonable, in fact, that I *fell in love* with one of mine, but that's another story). These are just a few of the critical things that management here does very well, but above all, Lauren is communicative, fair, friendly, and can be counted on to handle questions and concerns in a timely fashion which demonstrates both professionalism and genuine empathy for The Ridge's tenants. The only reason I left is because I had grown out of the space and was ready to have my own apartment for the first time. In other words, the only thing that could have made my stay at The Ridge better would have been finding it as an even younger college student.\n\nAs far as student living goes, I am fairly convinced that no better combination of well-maintained living and overqualified management exists in this city. And I'm entirely convinced that it doesn't exist at this price.\n\n- Brandon and Stephanie",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Property Ridge Apartments offers several appealing aspects for those seeking a well-located and convenient place to live. User reviews highlight the property's proximity to essential amenities, including a grocery store, mobile service providers, and other retail outlets, all within a short walk. Many reviews praise the spaciousness of the rooms, which easily accommodate a full bed, desk, and additional furniture without feeling cramped. Management's effective communication has also been appreciated, ensuring maintenance requests are handled promptly and expectations are clear. Lastly, several reviewers note the reasonable pricing for the quality provided, making it a competitive choice in the local market.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Many tenants highlight the exceptional management style of Lauren, the property manager, noting her prompt, empathetic, and professional handling of concerns. Responses to maintenance requests are quick, noise complaints are addressed efficiently, and parking permits are enforced, reflecting a well-run establishment. Renters appreciate Lauren\u2019s willingness to ensure tenant satisfaction, and her proactive measures in handling questions and compatibility concerns make the Ridge Apartments standout. The harmonious living experience provided by both the well-maintained apartments and management seem to set a high standard in Bellingham, especially for student residents. </p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the many positive aspects, some tenants have voiced grievances regarding miscommunication and financial disputes with the property management. One reviewer expresses dissatisfaction, mentioning a perceived exploitation of tenants for financial gain, which contrasts sharply with the more favorable reviews. Another issue raised is the frequent construction noise, which disrupts the daily lives of some residents, making the location less ideal for those seeking quiet surroundings. These complaints suggest room for improvement, particularly in communication clarity and managing noise levels effectively. </p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most concerning issues reported involve communication and financial transparency, with one reviewer alleging that the management team exploits residents for money, citing persistent communication errors. This stark criticism reveals a serious disconnect between tenant expectations and management delivery, suggesting a need for systematic improvements to restore confidence. Additionally, the ongoing construction noise aggravates the living experience for some, pushing potential tenants to consider their options carefully. These negative reviews, although fewer in number compared to positive ones, highlight areas the management could address to improve the overall satisfaction at Property Ridge Apartments.</p></section>"
