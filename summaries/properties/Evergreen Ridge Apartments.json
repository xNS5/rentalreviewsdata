      "review": "I rented here for six years , the worst place ever ! Don't let the new paint they put on the outside and new windows and cheap blinds make you think they are nice . This new management is the worst. My unit flooded due to an explosion's of the expansion tank. They have 3 days to fix it . By law they have to offer you either another unit or a hotel. They said it would take one week to repair . When I asked the manager what they were doing to fix it they said oh dry the carpets out and your good to go. This happened on the 4th of November 2023. It was still not repaired when I moved out. I gave my notice as I asked them to replace the very old already stretcher out carpet and they had just sent on the 28th of November someone to asses the drywall damage as it had over two inches of water through the entire apartment, it was all declaired damaged so still no repairs. The water was left off and they put up no safety warnings for the water in the unit to stay out or anything. they didn't ask if i had a place to go or if i needed a place they never followed up to let me know what was going on with the unit but had me pay rent for the entire month . I was in it for 4 days . they had heaters running and fans for 24/7 days a week. My power bill never past 100 a month was over 200.00 and they also sent me a notice to inform me my rent was short and that they had added late fees for a unit i couldn't even stay in. i found out from several other tenants that they expansion tanks had also flooded their unit which meant they had never serviced them or done any checks on any of the hot water heaters following several floods continued to let them happen instead of replacing the 1995 expansion tank they had in the units. these by law are to be inspected once a yr. This place is awful the manager wouldn't answer our calls she was screening them. if any others want to come forward about there unit flooding at evergreen ridge i am taking them to small claims court in the process of filing now and have a good strong case for rent deposit as we cleaned without water. also for the cost of the 1000 deposit on new unit and extra expenses for the month i coach surfed. my things were al in my unit ruined and i expect payment for this . I have been stressed out and treated terrible by the management. No notices given when many people entered my apartment and a 48 hour notice must be issued leaving my things exposed and vulnerable to anyone who walked in my unit. Find another place do not move here they are money hungry unkind and  cheap.",

  "summary": "# Evergreen Ridge Apartments: An Objective Look at Resident Reviews\n\n## Good\nEvergreen Ridge Apartments boasts commendations in several user reviews for their excellent maintenance and management services. Residents express satisfaction with the complex's responsive and friendly staff, often noting how maintenance issues are handled promptly and efficiently. Several long-term tenants have highlighted how peaceable and trouble-free their time at Evergreen Ridge has been, attributing this to a respectful attitude and maintaining good relationships with the property management.\n\nThe facility's location is praised as well, situated conveniently near shopping centers, post offices, restaurants, and movie theaters, making it an ideal place for those who enjoy having amenities within walking distance. The area is described as quiet and safe, with a few comments noting a strong sense of community among the residents. Some tenants have lived at Evergreen Ridge Apartments for upward of five years, suggesting a certain level of contentment with their living environment.\n\n## Great\nPositive reviews also note the condition of the apartments and the grounds, stating that they are well cared for, clean, and inviting. Happy residents made specific mention of the amenities available, such as a gym, sauna, and clubhouse, which cater to a variety of resident needs and promote a comfortable lifestyle. The approachability and care shown by some members of the management team seem to have made a significant impact, making residents feel welcome and attended to.\n\nFurthermore, the dedication to upholding a high standard of living is recognized by some residents who appreciate the timely and considerate manner in which management has responded during the COVID-19 pandemic. The apartments also receive accolades for their quietness even when located at the crossing of two busy streets, indicating good insulation and building quality. This has contributed to a living experience that is both peaceful and convenient.\n\n## Bad\nHowever, not all user reviews reflect such a rosy picture. Some residents have conveyed serious grievances, particularly about the management's handling of maintenance concerns. Instances of apartments flooding have been reported, with dissatisfaction surrounding the speed of repair and follow-up by the management. A tenant experienced a flood due to an exploded expansion tank, alleging negligence since repairs were slow and they received no assistance regarding temporary relocation.\n\nComplaints extend to financial grievances as well. There's a mention of significant rent increases without prior warning, raising questions about the affordability and value provided by Evergreen Ridge Apartments. Renters have felt mistreated when it comes to monetary dealings, such as the application of late fees for a unit that was uninhabitable due to maintenance issues, and disappointment over management not waiving rents under exceptional circumstances like uninhabitable living conditions.\n\n## Ugly\nThe more troubling aspects of Evergreen Ridge Apartments as reported in user reviews include allegations of rude and unprofessional behavior by the management team. Reviews mention managers being disrespectful towards tenants and potential renters, adversely affecting the community's perception of the staff. Additionally, safety concerns have been raised due to inadequate communication regarding towed vehicles and a lack of proper signage post-remodeling.\n\nResidents have recounted experiences of feeling bullied by the property management and anxiety from living in what they considered an unsafe environment. Such sentiments contribute to an atmosphere where some renters question the integrity of the management and find the overall service quality lacking. The severity of these claims suggests that the personnel involved may not adhere consistently to the standards of hospitality and resident care often expected in property management.\n\nThis article's intent is to provide a balanced overview of resident experiences at Evergreen Ridge Apartments as synthesized from user reviews. While the staff has responded to some positive reviews, demonstrating engagement with their clientele, it is essential to weigh both the positive and negative feedback. These reviews are generated by ChatGPT, serving as a tool for individuals in search of unbiased information concerning property management services or rental options."
