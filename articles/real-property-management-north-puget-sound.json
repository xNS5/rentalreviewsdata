I was so grateful to have Mr. Nico come out today to help remove our old water tank heater.\n\nNico assessed the situation and immediately, devised a game plan and executed it in impeccable timing and efficiency. Nico was a one man army today and even repaired some of the work that was done on the initial visit. He took great care of us.\n\nMake sure he gets a good raise \n\nThank you again Nico!",

        "review": "RENTER BEWARE: Deceitful Property Management Company: 8/20/24 - RPM coerced me into signing a lease prior to viewing RPMs side of the move-in checklist. Thus, I didn't have a full understanding of the units' conditions. Furthermore, they exhibited deceitful business practices by telling me that I must sign the checklist and pay ALL FEES prior to receiving the keys. Upon arriving at the unit, it was found that the unit was left uncleaned (currently living in the last tenants filth), damaged beyond normal wear and tear, and exhibited signs of extreme water damage and black mold along with structural concerns. It seems that there's been no prevented maintenance for years. I am now concerned about my health and safety and, coupled with poor communication practices, has resulted in undostress and suffering for someone with medically evaluated disabilities like myself. Will continue to provide updates on the matter.",

To avoid being charged, I would highly recommend taking photos of absolutely everything, and even then RPM will still find something.\n\nWe left the place better than we found it, obliging with getting professional cleaners and carpet cleaners and yet RPM seems to nitpick on things that are just normal wear and tear. When attempting to contact them to come to a fair resolution they will placate you on the phone letting you know things will be ok or that they will call you back after confirming some things internally; this is all stalling - after a while they will just charge your security deposit and send you the invoice and then start dodging any attempts to call them.\n\nIf you are in this situation I would suggest being relentless with their phone lines until you get some actual confirmation in writing. DO NOT give them the benefit of the doubt or rely on their good faith. Get everything in writing very clearly and don't give up or stop calling them.",

Here at Real Property Management North Puget Sound, we make every effort to be honest and fair with the Tenants as well as the Owner of the property. If there is damage caused by the tenant that is beyond normal wear and tear, we are obligated to charge the tenant for that damage to make the Owner whole. For this reason, we take numerous photos at our very thorough pre-move in assessment.  We have no reason or incentive to be dishonest or unfair. Additionally, we resolved your problem with you and you said you'd remove the 1 star review. "

Being this is my first rental property I was uncertain of the process and at the beginning I had many questions and hesitations. The staff at Real Property Management helped alleviate my stress and fears. Everyone I have worked with in the office was patient, kind, and knowledgeable answering all of my questions and with their guidance I know the process has been streamlined. Without the Real Property Management Team in my corner I know the rental process would have been extremely stressful.

        "review": "While Real Property Management might seem like a convenient choice for renting, my experience with them has been less than satisfactory.\n\nLet me start with the move-out process, which was a nightmare. Expect to jump through hoops and incur unexpected expenses. Despite leaving the apartment in decent condition, I was hit with charges for what should be considered normal wear and tear. Nail holes in the wall, interior painting, and light bulb replacements were all on the list of things I was charged for. It felt like they were searching for any excuse to dip into my deposit. The most absurd part? Being forced to hire a professional cleaning company at my own expense.\n\nSpeaking of deposits, be prepared to say goodbye to a chunk of yours for a suspicious $200 admin fee. Apparently, coordinating move-out work that was supposedly my responsibility warranted this hefty deduction. And let's not forget the exorbitant charges for seemingly minor items. $284 for a freezer shelf? $77 for a gallon of paint? Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nWhat's more, their strict subleasing policy is downright exploitative. Want to sublease? Sure, but only if you're willing to fork over three months' rent. It's a blatant cash grab and shows a complete lack of consideration for renters.\n\nOverall, Real Property Management seems more interested in nickel and diming tenants than providing a fair and transparent renting experience. If I had known about their overly scrutinous move-out process beforehand, I would have meticulously documented every detail on the move-in inspection form. Consider yourself warnedrenters, beware.",

At Real Property Management, we strive to provide a fair renting experience.\nRegarding the move-out process, charges for items like excessive nail holes, tenant damage that requires painting, and burnt out light bulbs are outlined in the Lease Agreement, and are standard for maintaining the property's condition.\nThe admin fee for coordinating maintenance for tenant damage upon move-out is also standard and communicated upfront in the Lease Agreement.\nOur subleasing policy is firm to ensure compliance with leasing regulations and protect both tenants and property owners.\nWe're sorry our processes didn't meet your expectations, though they were explained at lease signing and detailed in the lease.

        "review": "Future tenants should be aware that RPM puts their landlords above their tenants and are only interested in making money, not supporting the tenants. In a disagreement of the use of my security deposit, Gail was rude and unhelpful and because we couldnt agree, now I have to take an extra step and file a lawsuit just to get my deposit back. Gail repeatedly said the house was dirty to be rude rather than using any level of professionalism or customer service. She also offered no avenue to dispute the charge other than continuously saying this is how it must be instead of understanding its a mutual disagreement and we could use a mediator to resolve it. Why not clarify that its well within a tenant rights to dispute the charges? Im unsure if Gail is incapable or just unwilling to read the laws laid out to protect Washington state tenants.\n\nI understand needing to leave the house in a certain condition based on our lease agreement but was being rude necessary? We are poor and we did our best, we couldnt afford the cleaners they wanted. We work full time and go to school full time, I couldnt spend more than a month deep cleaning the house to meet RPM needs. I recognize they want the house in a certain way and we didnt meet that standard but at this point and based on Gails attitude, I just feel totally scammed no matter what they say is wrong with the house because anything I say will just be met with this is how it must be done. In my opinion, forcing your tenants to perfect the home to your standard out of pocket is just taking advantage of renters who often dont have a choice about the fact they are renting.  Its unfortunate that RPM  doesnt do any work themselves and expects the previous tenant to perfect the house out of pocket for the next tenant, continuing to limit any work needed on RPM side and keeping them from having to bother investing in their properties and tenants.\n\nI also find it extremely important to mention that we returned the house in the exact position it came in when we got it minus regular wear and tear from living in a 100+ year old house for 2 years. It was equally as dirty when we moved in, I spent 2 years deep scrubbing the dirty off of everything in the home (pictures below).\n\nSome advice for RPM, maybe try caring about your tenants and properties by cleaning them yourself rather than being lazy and judgmental? Maybe also have a pre written email ready for tenant deposit disputes since you are not able to talk them through as a company in a nice and professional way. Regardless of their reasoning for taking some or all of my deposit, I just hope future tenants dont make the same mistakes I did and spend 2 months cleaning the house and scrubbing every inch to perfection and most importantly, have Gail walk through your house before you move out so its harder to get taken advantage of - otherwise they do the walkthrough alone and make their own decisions.\n\nI also have a strong feeling based on their previous negative reviews that they will respond to this unprofessionally too. I dont care about the deposit or them, I just want other tenants to be protected and not make the same mistakes I did by renting through them.",

Had many issues throughout the stay. Countless emails and complaints. Never were they taken care of. Had inspector come in every 6 months and would tell us every time that their notes and pictures were sent to property owner. And that most of the issues were ongoing before moving in. The stairs/porch/and back patio were unsafe and rotting.\nI understand these are issues that the property owner should have taken care of. But with no help from the property management, we got no where to fix the issues.\nMany times random employees would call or email to ask about lists of things needing to be done without investigating or checking with other employees who have already been made aware of issues. It was a constant cat and mouse game with this property management. It seemed like no one communicated within the office. And nothing was ever taken serious.\nOne night a pipe busted in our bathroom gushing hot water. For hours we couldn't get it to stop. We called the emergency line left a message. No one called back until the morning. Imagine if we didn't figure that out how high our bill would have been or how damaged the house could have gotten.\nThe fridge when we moved in was broken with missing drawers and shelves.\nI don't know how property management could let this home get so bad and not do their due diligence with the owners to fix these terrible issues.\n\nI've since moved out of state.

From our initial meeting to the successful one-year rental period, I couldn't be more satisfied with their services.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of RPMNPS is their commitment to ensuring the property is in optimal condition for attracting quality tenants. Frank Volkert, in particular, demonstrated a keen understanding of the market and provided valuable suggestions to enhance my property's appeal. His recommendations for painting and new floor coverings proved to be instrumental in attracting a pool of applicants.\n\nThe meticulous move-in inspection conducted by RPMNPS's home inspector set the tone for the professional standards upheld by the company. It was reassuring to know that they took the time to thoroughly assess the property before tenants moved in. Equally commendable was the follow-up inspection after six months, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining the property's condition over the long term.\n\nThroughout the process, Frank displayed excellent communication and negotiation skills. From the moment the property was ready, he promptly presented a range of qualified applicants, allowing us to make an informed decision. This proactive approach ensured a seamless transition from property preparation to successful tenant placement.\n\nI appreciate the transparency and efficiency demonstrated by RPMNPS. Frank and his team's dedication to maximizing rental returns and ensuring tenant satisfaction have resulted in a trouble-free rental experience for the past year. I am grateful for their expertise and highly recommend Real Property Management Group Northwest to anyone seeking reliable and effective property management services.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with RPMNPS has been nothing short of outstanding, and I am confident in their ability to continue delivering top-notch property management services in the future.

With continual feeling of disappointment which creeps in often and almost want you to give up and not make an attempt at something. Real Property Management (RPM) sure comes with ease at a time my family and me needed this relief. Renting a house has never been this easy with us trying for about 3 years (by our experience). Happened to be on Zillow and having fallen victim of scam 2x through Zillow- I saw our new place listed on Zillow, first thing that struck my mind was to scroll down the listing page, check out who made the listing as I wasnt going to move forward if it was listed by an individual but surprisingly it wasnt. I copied the name of the company to browser which sourced them out, I clicked on their website only to find the listing and many more houses listed for rent. That right there gave me a little hope as a start. I scheduled viewing for the next day and I must say RPM team over at Marysville WA, are all phenomenal. Things went too fast and in two weeks we are officially in our new rented place. All thanks to Rep Cynthia & Rose for helping to make the entire process worthwhile and smooth for us. Gods speed of blessings ladies. PS: I have referred two of our family friends for your service.",

I signed up in Sept 2022, paid them 30% of rent in onboarding fees but they did not onboard tenants till late Oct, and didn't collect rent from one tenant for so long that led to eviction. Did the same with another tenant. Lost over 1 year of rents. They charged higher than market prices for placing tenants but below par services. Highly unresponsive management company.

This a description of what happened.           \nLast year, when you first reached out to us about managing your 4-plex with existing tenants. We started management of units AB&D on 9/19/2022 and Unit C on 9/6/2022.  Unit A had 2 tenant's you had placed previously, that already were not paying you rent, we agreed to help you either get them to pay rent or get them to move on which we did. We got the tenants to vacate in Unit A on 11/30/22. They had trashed your rental so we facilitated a full renovation on Unit A to get it ready for the market by 12/27/2022 and got you new tenants for Unit A by 2/2/2023, this all during the slowest time of year for the rental market. Unit B was also a tenant you had placed before we started managing. She paid October 2022 rent, because of financial/emotional issues, she was not able to pay rent after that so we connected her with Volunteers of America and walked her through the process of applying for rental assistance. VoA assisted in helping her catch up with $5952.50 in rental assistance while she was paying what she could afford each month. However, she eventually stopped paying all-together and didn't apply for more assistance. She was evicted through legal process on 9/14/2023.  Unit 3 and 4 were also tenants you had found that we managed. They have been ideal tenants. Unit 3 & 4 have paid rent through the duration of our contract together. We worked diligently on the situation we were given and it's unfortunate that WA State Landlord Tenant Law mandates take longer than we all would have liked. Regarding the termination fees without proper notice as agreed to in the Management Contract. We discussed this with you and you wanted to terminate without proper notice regardless. "

When I bought our first rehab project, I called 6+ local managers, interviewed and received quotes from 3 and confidently picked RPM-NPS to partner with.  Not only was their pricing good, but they offered services and expertise from both their own collective experience and the knowledge (industry, financial, legal) provided from RPM's company headquarters.  They are a family-owned office that operates with integrity and good customer service - for owners and tenants.  I have always been able to call with questions and get advice over the phone, email or even on site at the property.  We have always worked through any issue together.  For example, the staff in Everett helped me to make decisions about how to best remodel my first property to maximize the rent I could receive and to lower the amount of future repairs and maintenance requirements.  This is knowledge I've applied to other remodels and purchases.  Now that I'm up to a handful of properties, RPM has helped me as a partner the whole way.  They are a critical part of the team I count on in RE investing along with my bankers, RE mentor, legal and insurance.  Knowing RPM is in my corner has been key in having the confidence to keep looking for more investments.  Obviously, I highly recommend Real Property Management - North Puget Sound!",

I have heard horror stories and experienced one with my last rental property manager. So, when I found a house managed by RPM, I examined Real Property Management Puget Sound closely and found them to be professional, courteous, and timely in their responses. I decided that they were a property management company that I could work with.\n\nAmy Hammer was our leasing agent and she was incredibly friendly and helpful. She walked us through the lease and the requirements before we signed.\n\nOn a scale of 1-5, I would give RPM a 4 (5 being stellar and no way to improve, 1 being \"don't ever work with them\"). The leasing process was smooth and Amy was available to answer any questions/concerns via email. She was very timely in her responses and addressed our concerns and questions well. We have had to put in a few maintenance requests and RPM was always prompt with addressing the requests. The problems we had were with the third party vendors who would often not return RPM's calls. But, that does not reflect on RPM.\n\nReal Property Management exceeded my expectations as far as tenant privacy and autonomy. While there are quarterly walk-throughs, RPM is not overly demanding or intrusive as other property management companies can be.\n\nOne area to improve would be to communicate after a maintenance request has been completed. Two of our maintenance requests are still pending as (I assume, I haven't received communication about them) they are in the process of ordering replacement parts for a light fixture and a refrigerator. Followup emails as to what the plan is would be incredibly helpful.\n\nOverall, I would not hesitate recommending RPM to someone looking to rent a home.",

        "review": "Future tenants should be aware that RPM puts their landlords above their tenants and are only interested in making money, not supporting the tenants. In a disagreement of the use of my security deposit, Gail was rude and unhelpful and because we couldn't agree, now I have to take an extra step and file a lawsuit just to get my deposit back. Gail repeatedly said the house was 'dirty' to be rude rather than using any level of professionalism or customer service. She also offered no avenue to dispute the charge other than continuously saying 'this is how it must be' instead of understanding it's a mutual disagreement and we could use a mediator to resolve it. Why not clarify that it's well within a tenant rights to dispute the charges? I'm unsure if Gail is incapable or just unwilling to read the laws laid out to protect Washington state tenants.\n\nI understand needing to leave the house in a certain condition based on our lease agreement but was being rude necessary? We are poor and we did our best, we couldn't afford the cleaners they wanted. We work full time and go to school full time, I couldn't spend more than a month deep cleaning the house to meet RPM needs. I recognize they want the house in a certain way and we didn't meet that standard but at this point and based on Gail's attitude, I just feel totally scammed no matter what they say is wrong with the house because anything I say will just be met with 'this is how it must be done'. In my opinion, forcing your tenants to perfect the home to your standard out of pocket is just taking advantage of renters who often don't have a choice about the fact they are renting. It's unfortunate that RPM doesn't do any work themselves and expects the previous tenant to perfect the house out of pocket for the next tenant, continuing to limit any work needed on RPM side and keeping them from having to bother investing in their properties and tenants.\n\nI also find it extremely important to mention that we returned the house in the exact position it came in when we got it minus regular wear and tear from living in a 100+ year old house for 2 years. It was equally as 'dirty' when we moved in, I spent 2 years deep scrubbing the dirty off of everything in the home (pictures below).\n\nSome advice for RPM, maybe try caring about your tenants and properties by cleaning them yourself rather than being lazy and judgmental? Maybe also have a pre written email ready for tenant deposit disputes since you are not able to talk them through as a company in a nice and professional way. Regardless of their reasoning for taking some or all of my deposit, I just hope future tenants don't make the same mistakes I did and spend 2 months cleaning the house and scrubbing every inch to perfection and most importantly, have Gail walk through your house before you move out so it's harder to get taken advantage of - otherwise they do the walkthrough alone and make their own decisions",

        "review": "I would highly recommend using SOMEONE ELSE to rent out your home. Over the course of a little under four months they dropped the ball on numerous minor maintenance issues and exhibited poor communication throughout that period. Ultimately they decided they couldn't handle our reasonable requests and, tired of being called out on their poor performance, dropped us (a true blessing). Below are numerous examples of why you should use SOMEONE ELSE to rent out your house. \n- Right off the bat they didn't advertise  our house correctly, completely leaving out the central air conditioning (something not every house has in the PNW) and mislabeled the square footage. Our tenants were not told about the air conditioning either until a neighbor casually mentioned it in conversation in the dead of summer.  We were also told we'd be informed of all applicants before signing. After many phone calls we were told a week after someone had already signed a lease. \n- Miscommunication by the maintenance department. We had told them before signing We'd like a break down of all expenses for maintenance, which they said they'd provide us.  Once we signed with RPM they immediately went against their word and would not give us any form of billing breakdown.  \n- Second issue with maintenance department. Told them our furnace had been serviced June 2018. While performing maintenance on the property in April 2019 they asked if we wanted it serviced. We told her that if the maintenance man on the property would be able to check furnace at same time that would be fine so that we didn't have to pay to send him out again in 2 months. He couldn't so RPM sent a separate maintenance person out (zero notification to us) and we received an early surprise bill. \n- Third issue with maintenance department. They sent a plumber out to fix a toilet issue twice on the same toilet (we would later find out). After calling Sarah (maintenance manager) multiple times over a 2 week period to get a straight answer we were told the plumber claimed it was a different toilet the second visit.  We were able to fix it for $15 after paying over $200 to a plumber they work with. \n- Called to ask about the annual inspection coming up due to our growing concerns with tasks being forgotten with the property. We were told by Sarah that we'd be cc'd in an email in regards to scheduling it. After one week we still had not received an email. We were about to follow up again when we were contacted  saying the inspection had been already been done. The inspection and photos were supposed to be of the whole house, but what we received were only two out of three floors, completely missing the full basement (which includes a bedroom, walk in closet, and full bathroom), and our garage. When questioned about it I was told they'd be sent back without additional charge. Surprise, they never came.\n- Fourth issue with the maintenance department. I was told by Erin and Frank before signing that any maintenance expense would be cleared with me and that we would not be in contact with the tenant. The property company is supposed to be our middle man. After the annual inspection we had a few repairs including a front porch step. We had called Sarah in the maintenance department and told her we would hire someone to come out so they could inform the tenant. They then told us they don't inform the tenant if they don't hire the maintenance man. We spoke with Gail (office manager) since we were told we couldn't contact the tenant and were told that most owners just let them take care of everything and don't worry as much. Our home is important to us and too expensive to not care about these expenses, especially since RPM had developed a pattern of dropping the ball on basic things in only a three month period.\n- After having months of back to back issues we requested to please speak to Frank or Daniel (father/son owners of the company) to ease our mind. Upon asking for clarification or an apology so we can move forward we received an email stating it was best to part ways. In this email it stated that they would mail all documents, security deposit, and keys for the property within 30 days. They screwed this up too. We never received keys for our property with the documents and security deposit within those 30 days and after waiting until mid September we contacted RPM about the keys. They told us at first they should of been mailed (they hadn't). We asked if they'd please check so we we know if we we need to rekey the home right away. The receptionist found them and offered to mail them to us and we finally got them nearly four weeks after we were told they'd arrive. \n- RPM told us our tenants were a family of five, which we learned was untrue and they were really a family of seven. The number of family members isn't a big deal but a rental company should be able to give a clear and truthful answer to a question like that.",

        "review": "If I could give this place 0 stars I would but sadly that's not an option. We moved into our townhouse leased by RPM in February 2020 right before the Covid lockdown. Two weeks into moving in a pipe burst in our ceiling above the kitchen. It took 9 months to fix it YALL 9 MONTHS. Not to mention anytime we have put it in a request for maintenance no one responds for months or even reaches out to check on us. SHAMS AND SCAMS. We have paid every month on Time through out a global pandemic and I can't even get a text back. The most recent event that took place happened today which led to me writing this review. Our lease is renewing at the first of August. One of our room mates communicated to our landlord and RPM at the beginning on July that she would be moving and that a new room mate would be moving in. RPM said nothing and our landlord gave th go ahead. Now we have 3 days until the new lease is due for renewal and they STILL haven't taken our old room mate off and new room mate on. Now they are saying our new room mate has to apply and pay $100 to be added to the lease -excuse me WHAT. The lady named Sue we talked to today was incredibly rude and condescending to our new room mate she even MADE FUN OF HER LAST NAME. Like was laughing at it. It was disgusting. They are human trash bags and Im not one to leave a 1 star review but this is OBSCENE. Run for the hills if this is your property management company on a place you are looking at renting.",

But we heard it is a growing area and could be a good investment. We wanted to know what kind of rent a small, 1000' rental might bring in a specific area from the point of view from a property management firm?\n\nChrista, Executive Assistant was incredible! She not only assisted with with my original question providing approximate rental incomes. \n\nHer knowledge of the area, her explanation of her company's services was the most thorough of the several other property management companies I spoke with. She was able to assist me much better than anyone else even though I was not asking them to manage a property for them...\n\nChrista understood that someone in a preliminary search to purchase a rental is just as important to serve as a homeowner searching for the right property management company.\n\nShe told me of the growing area, about the two hospitals nearby, also a new WSU campus soon to be built and that the closer one gets to the water the higher the property values are.\n\nChrista was able to inform me of the process by which they utilize for billing homeowners for any repairs per month, when rents were due (3 day grace period for tenants) and when homeowners were transferred their monthly rent due. She described their program enabling all billings to be available to the homeowner online and emphasized how simplistic and easy it was to understand.\n\nShe described surrounding areas such as Mukilteo, their great school district and how many tenants enjoy living in the Mukilteo vicinity...\n\nChrista provided me with much more than just potential rent info. She is a terrific representative for this company, Real Property Managagement.\nWe are so appreciative of her patience, knowledge and willingness to go outside of the box to help us.  \n\nBottom line, if we require services of a Property Management Co I will call Christa because I know she would get the job done and get it done right.\n\nPlease thank her for me.",

The owners are not the people they portray to be and they are not helpful at all. My Advise to all potential homeowners, do not rent your home thru these guys.

BEWARE\n\n\nI will continue to advice the public on how they treat people and what the company is about!!!!\n\n\n\nReply to Frank.\n\nOnce again full of lies from Frank the owner, we do not drink any alcohol because if religious convictions.

Your maintenance person who you say is so friendly and non aggressive was cursing a woman out! This does not sound like a nice maintenance person. Your employee is a coward for fighting with a woman and your team did not check on the tenants like they should have. You should have caught that they were making modifications to the house like building shelves. \n\nOnce again your company and your team is not who you say they are.

I'll try to keep this short, despite having a lot to say.  To be transparent, I'm writing this review as a tenant, since that was my interaction with RPM.\nMove-in and the checklist took over an hour and a half!  Longest I've experienced as a tenant.  I called their emergency line because there was water under the fridge that continued to appear after wiping it up.  It took them 2 days to get back to me.  Other than that, all was good during our short (3-4 month) lease.  The real headaches came when it was time to terminate our lease early - we paid the steep early termination penalty (which I don't have a problem with, it was a part of the contract and I'm a reasonable person).  They advised when we moved in that we would have to use \"one of (their) approved vendors\" for both the move-out cleaning and carpet cleaning.  This is where the biggest frustration with RPM lays - RPM only had a single vendor for both.  I had no choice at all for who we used.  See my separate review of the cleaning company, Morgan Real Estate Management.  I was at the mercy of those vendors for what they wanted to charge for their services.  \nI understand that RPM is working to protect the owner of the rental property.  However, from a tenant perspective, you're going to pay on the backend of your rental.  Personally, I'd stay away from them as a tenant in the future - they aren't reasonable when it comes to services at move-out.",

There are more fees than a traditional PM, but they have a lot of guarantees and I can tell you from past rental experience you want the PM that checks on your house every 6 months.  They have a guy Jeff that sends out detailed reports on the 6 month walk throughs with pictures so you can see how your property looks.  Additionally, when I call or have a concern, the staff take my concerns seriously which is important to me because I have had other PMs who acted like me renting was just a hobby and they woudn't email or call me back.

During the entire time we rented it out, RPM was our partner in every way, walking us through the process of being a rental owner, handling the stress of managing the property, and ensuring that we had quality renters each and every time.  When it came time to pass the baton to someone else and sell our home, RPM worked closely through the transition process, even serving as our go-between with the utility company after the last renters moved out so that the process could move forward (we live in another state now, making dealing with the utility company difficult)!  They also referred us to a good real estate agent.  I wish we could have sold the property sooner (e.g. May / June) and gotten a better return, but we are still extremely happy with RPM of North Puget Sound.  The entire team has our complete endorsement, without reservation!\n\n- - - - - -\n\nPrevious Review (5/29/2015):\nMy family and I had to move after I was laid off and needed to relocate across the country.  We wanted to set up our home in WA as a rental, so we researched rental management agencies for some time to locate the right one.  \n\nAfter significant investigation, we determined that Real Property Management of North Puget Sound (RPM) would be the best fit for us, due to their professionalism, care, and concern for their customers.\n\nWe have not been disappointed at any time, and in fact our expectations were met and exceeded when a minor snafu with a changed bank account and a misplaced payment was rectified over the weekend by Frank and his team.\n\nAmazing service and dedication - we cannot recommend them highly enough.",

But the staff at Rpm is very friendly and kind and prompt in getting back with us even when it is not their place to. Our landlord is responsible for all repairs but they kindly send their service man out to fix our washer when it was not their job to and that I am grateful for.

They not only take forever to respond and address your issues and problems with the home your renting, but they also charge you fees they are not entitled to and take money without notifying you out of your security deposit once you move out and refuse to answer you on the matter. They do not abide by the law, you have to fight them on the tenant and landlord law for them to \"get things going\", and even when you have proof, they are still passive aggressive. They do not allow you to be present at the walk thru after you move out, which allows them to come up with whatever they want to come up with. They require you to use their carpet cleaning company, you're not allowed to use any other company. You have to use their cleaning companies and even if you have a quote and receipt of the service in hand, they add additional fees on top of that without notifying you.  If you call for service like you would any other rental, ie. fridge isn't working, dishwasher broke, no hot water etc., they will charge you at the end of your lease without ever telling you about it and then just arbitrarily come up with a figure and deduct that out of your security deposit when it is their responsibility to take care of these items.

The only reason we stayed in our rental for 2 years was because we loved the house and our neighbors. And the home owner was also military and we didn't want to screw her over by leaving. But, these people were a nightmare to deal with. We moved in and like with any rental company we were give x amount of days to add issues to the walk through list and document things that needed to be fixed. But, when we emailed them we never got a reply. Emailed again no reply. Any time we needed something to be fixed it took weeks or more to hear back from someone. But you better believe the one time there was an issue with our bank they were blowing up my phone! The staff is rude and unprofessional and the owners refuse to email back as well. Last June the refrigerator started leaking and caused black mold (which I'm severely allergic to) and it took over a month for their \"maintenance\" guy to come look at it, and then when he swore it was fixed a few days later it was leaking again. We called the company no response, emailed no reply. Fast forward a few months and my husband received new military orders and these idiots refused to let us out of our lease even with OFFICIAL MILITARY ORDERS!

With Washington rental laws set up to favor the tenant, it was becoming increasingly difficult to stay in compliance as well as  feel my property was being cared for.  I manage vacation rental properties in Colorado and most of the time really enjoy it, so giving up management of the house in Edmonds was not easy for me to do.  I called several agencies and Daniel  V. was the one answering the phone, ( not a machine) so I was able to feel a personal touch right off the bat.   Daniel has been personable and conscientious throughout the term of what is now the second lease.  Although the costs of management companies in the metro Seattle area are higher than they are in many places, I like working with a family business who I have found to be trustworthy. At times I have felt like Real Property leaned over backwards to please the tenants, without much regard for how I as the owner felt or saw it.  But they have found good matches for my house, the rent has always come in and renters have taken good care of the  house.  I have suggested them to others and will continue to.  I did not give them 5 stars because for me the best of the best in  management companies would be one that has several management plans to select from, e.g. just marketing and placement or just overseeing once a tenant is placed etc.  I did find a few who do this, but I stayed with Real Property because I had begun a working relationship with them and I trust them.",
