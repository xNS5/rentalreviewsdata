They auto-texted me telling me to go online to schedule a \"tour.\"  We;;, there's no place on their web site to do that.  Also, the units listed as available on their web site are not what is actually available to rent!\n\nI called them and was told that they have noting to tour.  Nothing available.  The lady was short, rude and seemed like she didn't want to be bothered.\n\nI will not be renting here.  Ever.",

The (current as of this writing) staff is amazing. Caring, fun, hard working, and you can really talk to them when in need of anything!\n\n3.) It seems that everyone here is doing their best and I really believe we have a strong community right now. \n\nWith that being said, there are some downsides to living here (city) and these are things you are going to find pretty much no matter where you are living in Bellingham unfortunately. \n\nI should mention we have community get togethers for the kiddos, and we have a pool and hot tub open during the summer. \n\nAll year round we have a fitness room. \n\nSo happy to have an affordable place to live while I am preparing to buy a house.",

There is a swimming pool, a movie theatre, an office to use computers, and a great bunch of friendly neighbors! The office staff will bend over backwards to help you with any problems that may arise. There are washers and driers in the apartments, and saved car spaces for a fee. Close to shopping, schools, and the bus line runs near it. Come check us out!",

        "review": "Regency Park Apt truly deserves a 5 Star rating from me and my family members. We all agree that this place is amazing. Let me start by saying that ALL the people who work at Regency really make this place great. They are always so polite and professional. Absolutely ALL the people that work here deserve a medal. This place is constantly being built; like a new smoking area and a brand new children's play area outside. They also have a theater room, gym area, and a computer area. Also I notice how hard the workers are at their job; they care about this place, they constantly remodel, they constantly manage the areas that need tending, they are on time and work until the job is complete. My husband and I always see workers outside the complex fixing and building and always managing the trash. The office ladies are wonderful too! Any issues we had were taken care of right away. Plus our neighbors are great too; everyone here seems to mind their own business and it feels like a safe community. This place is huge so we have no problems with parking either. We are very happy living here. Thank you for all your hard work, our family surely appreciates it.",

        "review": "Currently live there, they don't uphold their own policies, they don't process paperwork in a timely manner, their office staff is overall poorly run and lack most common sense. As for maintenance, they half ass their jobs and often times don't come to fix problems when they say they will. My apartment has a washer that is so old that the metal all around the top and inside is rusting off and falling into the clothes loads (we have a roommate who has metal allergies and you can imagine this doesn't go well) and to top it off randomly stops working... rather than replace it they come in put some glue on it and wait for us to complain again and then tell us there is an on sight laundry facility (which costs money) but why use that when we pay 45$ each month to have an in unit washer and dryer?? There is frequent  apartment inspections for random things like stickers on the windows and every time they come in to inspect that the apartment they never take off their muddy boots. Carpet stains of course you will have to clean or it comes out of your deposit. It took them 2 months to get back to us with the results of a criminal background check to start the paperwork process of a new roommate which normally takes other apartments 2 days at maximum. Your rent is subject to price change even if you have a lease and will generally go up about 50$ a year. There is no parking tickets for people who park terribly over the lines or take up more than one spot ...and parking itself is very limited.  They overall will treat any complaint you have as if you are the problem even if its a reasonable complaint....Many of the ground floor apartments have moisture issues and have tendencies to grow  mold and the most that regency will do is give you a dehumidifier which you have to use but it runs up your electric bill.  Many of the people in the apartment complex leave their dogs waste EVERYWHERE so if you have kids always check their shoes. The apartment complex will send out fliers claiming they will give you a 25$ fine if you are caught but even if you have photo evidence of a person not picking up their dogs poop its not good enough. The management needs to see the person do it with their own eyes.. which they never will because they sit in their office all day and are out of sight of most of the grassy areas near the apartments.  So overall people can leave their poop everywhere knowing they have no consequences. There is no smoking allowed in the apartments however you are allowed to smoke on your porch IF you dispose of your cigarettes into an ash tray. However if you want to throw your cigarettes on the ground or even in front of your neighbors slider door so the smoke blows in their window go ahead again even though its against policy they wont enforce it. If you want to get your jolly's off of making your asthmatic neighbor go to the emergency room because you improperly dispose of your cigarettes GO FOR IT. \n\nThe was cheap when we moved in but now their rent prices are at par with other places.  The environment is total crap would not recommend to anyone.",
