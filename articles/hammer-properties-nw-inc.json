        "review": "Hammer manages 1125 Billy Frank jr. Street where I live, and overall its been a good experience. The apartment gets quite cold and damp due to thin wall and poor window seals, so a dehumidifier is a must. Only other issue Ive run into is plumbing. Ive had to submit numerous maintenance requests, but the property manager Jena Curry is always very responsive and helps maintenance happen as quickly as possible. As far as property managers go, this building has a winner.",

        "review": "I was going to be a cosigner on my daughters (student at WWU) lease in an old home in Bellingham. In the beginning this company was not straightforward and did not give me what I thought was due process as a cosigner.  As a co-signer I should have been provided all documents my daughter was provided to assure it is an acceptable deal to all parties involved. She is 20 and this would be her first house. Signing a legal contractual agreement was something she knew nothing about.\n\nWhen I went to tour the house with my daughter I was appalled at the rundown condition of the home.  This was not anywhere near the impression that was given to me by the property manager at  Hammer when I called upset that my daughter had signed the lease before I was able to see the house nor had I been given a copy of the lease by the company.   She led me to believe the property was in wonderful condition and the owners took very seriously that it was kept up well. I understand college houses are not in pristine condition, however, there were bigger issues with the house that I wasnt comfortable signing onto without thorough knowledge of the lease and what I was getting into.\n\nThe lease when I finally got a copy of it gave me some heartburn.  I am not a lawyer so I thought it was fair to ask them to put in writing that nothing in the lease supersedes the Washington Landlord Tenant Act (RCW 59.18).  The property manager adamantly refused to put anything in writing and said Im not going to jump through that hoop for you. She explained they have the lease agreement reviewed by lawyers and of course it would be consistent with the law. Then why is it such a big deal to email me and put in writing that their contractual agreement (lease) does not supersede the law that protects the tenant?\n\nFortunately, she let my daughter back out of the deal. What a relief not to have gotten into a potentially bad deal. That is the only good thing I can say about this company.\n\nThe victim in the wake of this interchange was the poor girl trying to move to California and get out of the lease herself.",

        "review": "For a property real-estate company with a monopoly on the city (typically crooked and theiving) hammer is actually ok. Our maintenance requests have been fulfilled pretty quickly and easily. They made a mistake with our deposit refund this year but luckily I had been diligent when we moved in and took pictures to record the state of the place. I called the new manager and she was great about refunding the rest of the money we were owed. I will say, they do raise the rent way too much annually for a company that doesn't allow leases linger than 1 year. We have not been able to stay in the same place for more than 2 years because of this. Once again, this is expected for a property management company that has a monopoly but still disappointing. Hoping to be able to stay in our current place for longer this time around but not likely. Both my roommate and I use different names than our legal ones and we have had mixed results with that. I am aware that legally they have to put our legal names on the lease but it is nice to not be addressed by a deadname. A couple of our past managers were NOT respectful of this but so far Daisy and Jena have been great! It really makes all the difference to be treated like a human as much as is allowed with this flawed system. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I DO NOT SUPPORT THE FACT THAT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO EXIST IN MONOPOLIES AND FORCE PEOPLE TO MOVE EVERY YEAR, however since we are trapped on this corrupt system and there are very few options hammer seems to be the only way. I have never had a problem with their online system (they do charge a $10 fee every time you pay rent which sucks but I get) and me, my roommate, and our dog (esa) plan on continuing with hammer.",

It took months for Hammer to come assess and fix the leaking and then they simply never replaced the wall trim.\n\nHe moved out of that apartment into a house on Grant street. I cannot believe they can legally house people and charge rent in this house. There is absolutely no way it is to code for so many reasons.\n\nCome to find out Hammer buys up almost all the properties near the college and downtown and has an absolute monopoly on renting for young adults.

Throughout my experience they proved to be exploitive and unresponsive, preying on college students who neither have the money nor means to stand up to this property management. They didn't respond to several of our maintenance requests, even when our roof was leaking into our house! And the few times maintenance was done, there was no prior notice and contractors came UNANNOUNCED! They took over a $1,000 of our security deposit, stating that they had hired a cleaning service for 12 + hours?!?! even though we had already cleaned and left the place in great shape! Mold and mildew tests that proved to be at dangerous levels were shrugged off by Joe the landlord and he said if it bothered us we could move. Not to mention, the vast majority of WWU college students that have rented from Hammer will tell you a similar story. Scroll through the other reviews and decide for yourself, but these property management company is criminal.",

She is by FAR the best property manager I have ever had and I've had a lot of them. She was kind, patient, responsive and professional. The space we moved into was really clean and we stayed there for 2 years. Anytime there were maintenance requests, we had people at the place in a day. I'm gonna say her name again: Lisa Meagher. If you rent through Hammer and you have Lisa as your property manager, you are in very good hands.\nWhen we moved out, we were conned into a terrible and falsely advertised house from Lakeway Rental. We had finally got our money back and had to search for a new place quickly. Lisa would immediately respond to companies for all of our rental verifications/applications and was incredibly patient as we tried to find a new home.\nI can't recommend her enough\nThanks Lisa",

My emotional animal is a 60lb pit bull mix; if your animal is truly serviced or needed for emotional support, you will have no issues. My partner and I made sure the house was clean and in good condition before we moved out and were happy to receive our entire deposit back in full. I think this property management may unfairly get a bad reputation because majority of properties are rented out to college students whom may not have a lot of patience when it comes to issues being resolved. So long as you are able to communicate your needs and be a decent human being, you will enjoy Hammer Properties.",

Communication with Lisa before move in was great - very responsive and professional to all our many questions. The terms of the lease were fair and straightforward. Move in went smoothly - the apartment was ready on time, it was clean and many updates had been made which was a pleasant surprise. Paying rent was easy and the utilities, which were split between all the apartments in the house was fair. Lisa went the extra mile when my son decided to transfer from WWU and sublet his apartment. Since his leave was unexpected and we live out of state it was a bit tricky for us to clean and show the apartment, and So Lisa graciously helped us get a tenant and transfer the lease. She was responsive to my emails and helped smooth out some bumps with the prospective tenant.\nAfter reading so many negative reviews, I was reluctant to rent with Hammer, but we had a great experience and I  could not have asked for a better property manager!",

We countered with a higher offer and they accepted quickly. Then we passed the septic inspection and Joe took a drinking water sample, which he bungled. Our realtor took another sample which we passed. Okay, so on to the house inspection right? Nope. This idiot then tries to run us through the ringer on whether the buyers can get Comcast or not. This was not part of the original agreement by the way. We have wireless and it is fast enough for us. Why we are supposed to agree on an add-on is beyond me. Joe finally said we had to agree to a \"feasability study\" or they would back out of the deal. So we said, \"Okay, you're done.\" It should be obvious that: 1) the buyers just wanted out of the deal or 2) Joe was trying to scam us into lowering our price. At any rate, this was not ethical behavior. Shame on you, Joe!\n\nNow our farm is back on the market and the potential buyers  missed out on a nice property. We don't have a rigid timeline so we can afford to wait and the real estate market in Whatcom County is still going up.

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Hammer Properties NW has been recognized by some users for their professionalism and promptness in responding to maintenance requests. In particular, Nikki Quinn and Lisa Meagher have been frequently commended for their exceptional customer service, always ensuring that tenants are well-informed and that maintenance issues are resolved swiftly. One user highlighted how Nikki not only advocated for them during the tenancy but also maintained flexibility with lease terms, contributing to a positive renting experience. Similarly, another reviewer praised Lisa\u2019s dedication to facilitating the rental process and providing fair lease agreements, making her a standout property manager. However, while some tenants have had positive interactions, these accounts appear selective and not uniformly experienced by all renters under Hammer Properties.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>In this article, we look at the high praise Hammer Properties NW receives, particularly for their competent and understanding property managers. For instance, one tenant mentioned that despite hearing negative things initially about the company, their experience was vastly improved thanks to Nikki Quinn's management. Nikki received accolades for her quick response to maintenance issues and for advocating for tenants, reversing a previously negative perception. Another tenant admired how Hammer Properties, when managed by attentive individuals like Lisa Meagher, created a supportive environment by ensuring the rental spaces are clean and lease terms are clear, which left a lasting impression. These experiences suggest that specific managers play a crucial role in elevating tenant satisfaction, with some significantly exceeding expectations in their roles.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite some positive feedback, Hammer Properties NW encounters criticism in terms of transparency and maintenance response times. Issues such as delayed maintenance interventions and oversight have been repeatedly cited by tenants. For example, several users noted scenarios where essential maintenance took too long, with a particular case of a new apartment suffering water leaks, which took months to address. Furthermore, concerns over the clarity and legality of lease agreements were highlighted, with some cosigners feeling neglected and misled about property conditions. This inconsistency in experience highlights the need for improved communication and promptness in addressing tenant concerns, as a way to enhance overall satisfaction with their management services.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Echoing harsher sentiments, numerous user reviews harshly criticize Hammer Properties NW for exploitative practices, particularly towards college students relying on affordable rentals. Disheartening accounts of maintenance neglect, such as unchecked mold and leaks, have left tenants feeling shortchanged and mistreated. Accusations of wrongful deposit deductions and avoidant communication further compound frustrations, leading to legal action in some instances. The overarching complaint of a monopoly in renting spaces near the college adds to the narrative of dissatisfaction and disenchantment. These experiences paint a stark contrast to the positive anecdotes, underscoring significant areas for improvement within the company to regain trust and accountability.</p></section>"
