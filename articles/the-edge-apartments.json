The cost to \"paint\" and \"clean\" (i.e., the things they don't have to itemize because it's labor) will be expensive. I lived there for 7 years and they didn't even replace the carpet after I moved out--it wasn't new when I moved in, either!",

The apartments and appliances are well taken care of, there is little parking, but it hasn't been a problem for me. There is available parking 1 block away. The staff and manager are always friendly and helpful.",

Youd think for how much they charge on rent it wouldnt be an issue for maintenance fixes but thats clearly not the case. The landlord has an attitude and is not prompt about updates or handling requests for maintenance. Rent through Son-Rise and dont waste your time or money living here.",

        "review": "Not a fan, mostly because of very poor parking. There are NO guests spots. Even if you so evade the tow trucks, get ready to cram into these unbelievably narrow spaces. Neighbor's intimate moments could easily be heard through walls. It is fancy, I'll give them that.",

Such positive sentiments indicate that while the property has its downsides, there are commendable features that some residents truly value.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>In this section, it's important to note that while some users may not have elaborated on all aspects of their experience, the absence of critical feedback allows us to infer positivity. For instance, a couple of users rated their time at The Edge Apartments with five stars, suggesting that their experiences were likely free from significant grievances. Their lack of details, however, may indicate that their living experience was satisfactory without any standout issues.</p><p>Additionally, the overall quality of the apartments appears to meet expectations for many, creating a comfortable space for both new and long-term residents. This aligns with the positive experiences shared by others, emphasizing that, despite certain complaints, there are plenty of tenants who find The Edge Apartments to be a great option in Bellingham.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>This article cannot overlook the concerns shared by users regarding The Edge Apartments, particularly around maintenance and communication. One resident recounted difficulties in receiving timely responses from the landlord for urgent repairs, which is a significant red flag for potential residents. The lack of promptness in addressing maintenance requests has led to frustration among tenants who expect reliable service given the cost of rent.</p><p>User reviews also noted issues such as thin walls, poor parking availability, and a general neglect of maintenance requests. For instance, residents complained about a cramped parking situation and unclear communication from management, which has detracted from their overall experience. Such recurring themes indicate that while some aspects of the living arrangement are appealing, management may need to improve in addressing these significant issues to enhance tenant satisfaction.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most troubling reviews about The Edge Apartments reflect experiences of unexpected costs and dissatisfaction with the handling of security deposits. One resident stressed the importance of documenting the condition of their unit upon moving out, as they faced exorbitant charges for cleaning and painting that seemed unjustified. The apprehension surrounding the return of security deposits amplifies fears about financial transparency and fairness within the management practices.</p><p>Another critique focused on the overall attitude of the landlord, with reports of unresponsiveness to maintenance requests that have left some tenants feeling neglected and undervalued. These alarming patterns paint a picture of a property management that could potentially compromise tenant satisfaction through inadequate service and a lack of accountability, making it crucial for prospective renters to weigh these factors when considering The Edge Apartments as a potential home.</p></section>"
