You put your house in their hands and expect them to maintain, but if they actually fix anything, its done by questionable people that dont seem to know what theyre doing. Instead of removing rot, lets just throw some toothpaste over it and call it a day. Extremely disappointed",

They are doing everything in their power to get me into a place. Breanna has been so helpful and supportive with my stress case self the rest of the staff have been wonderful! Sometimes we write bad reviews because we didnt get the answer we wanted. Some stuff isnt in their control FYI they still have to follow through with the owners of the property and their demands. Dont hesitate to give them a call. 10 starts from me! Thank you Breanna and team for all your hard work!",

I lived at\n13075 Avon Allen rd\nUnit b\nmount Vernon wa\n98273\nThis property has since been sold and hopefully taken from there control as property managers. They were the worst landlords ever upon move in the unit was  unclean and covered in animal hair. And had a very strong Oder. I reported this. At least tried to, I took and provided pictures. Because they say that its mandatory they take some of the deposit for rug cleaning they clearly didnt clean it. I felt as if I deserved to not be charged that. Well they still screwed me out of it. Then also any time something happened they never even attempted to fix it for weeks. Leaving me to do it. Which is fine if I was compensated for things they were responsible for. The grass. There was lawn mower on site and I wasnt given access to mow the lawn and it sat until it was over a foot and a half. Any ways. Honestly. Terrible out fit not honest. And they dont care",

Everytime you try calling to speak to the management person or whatever they are  busy or dont answer the phone. After they finally  approve you they want a double deposit ? A DOUBLE deposit for a place that looks like they havent fixed the kitchen since 1990?! They dont tell you when a place isnt available anymore until you ask and still are waiting on them to do their job and process your stuff. The office people arent the most welcoming either I saw the receptionist talking on the phone with a tenant and rolling her eyes !! I feel like they discriminated us since the other applicant I was applying with is Hispanic with an ITIN but yet we make 7X the rent together ? Thats crazy.\nAnyways goodluck if you apply with them.",

They have been responsive when I've needed assistance or information, and they have always been really pleasant to work with. It did take a little bit of time to get a new lease agreement drafted up, and we experienced a mix up in what our rent amount would be due to a clerical error, but that is a small drop in the bucket when compared to the rest of my experiences with them. I really don't have anything to complain about! I've been consistently thankful for my home!",

They gave me the opportunity to have something better newer and nice for my family. Unlike other realty companies in the area that are rude and treat you poorly. By FAR, the best rental application process I have ever experienced. The Manager and her team are above and beyond outstanding customer service. Cant say enough how happy and blessed I feel to have been introduced to This company.\n\nUPDATE: 9/4/19\nI Recently completed the move out process after finishing my lease. And this was just as customer friendly as amazing when I first moved in and went through the application process. In fact, I am only moving because I am relocating, otherwise I would still be there. Kathy is amazing and did everything she could to accommodate me. I a really appreciate. Being a tenant with Piazza and will be referring everyone I know.\n\n-Nick",

Rented me a home with non stop problems. Sinks not working, rat problems, heating issues along with a huge pile outside of previous tenants garbage that was never dealt with. You can contact them non stop about issues but they don't respond nor care. Said they could send out a maintenance man but after\n3 months waiting I gave up. I took pictures of rats garbage and everything. After moving out, they sent me to collections claiming  I owed for cleaning garbage ect for 1800. Lol Messed up my credit now I will fight them in court. This company is not new to the courts. They all know Piazza and everyone knows they are dishonest and not worth the headache to ever rent from.

I have not had a problem with them.  They are very professional in everything they do.\n\nThey only charge a small percentage of my rental income which is good because if I don't get rent then they don't get paid.  This is a very fair process unlike some other property managers that charge a fee regardless if it's rented or not.  They routinely checked on my property and made sure it was still in good shape.  I have not had any issues with any tenants over the 8 years it was rented.  If there were any issues with maintenance, they made sure it was taken care of and if it was an expensive fix, they always got my permission first to fix it.\n\nAfter I had listed my house for sale, they continued to work with my relator and I to make sure the property was good to go until the sale went through smoothly, even though they were not obligated to do so.  They went above and beyond their normal duties of a property manager.",

For this price,Mt Vernon has 2 bdrms for the same price in better neighborhoods.\nThanks for the response.

They have been professional, helpful, kind and courteous from my application process to moving in and so responsive to questions and a tiny, tiny item that needed to be fixed -- which was followed up within 2 hours and fixed perfectly by the next day.  They've been respectful, flexible and made my moving experience wonderful.  Not to mention, I am leasing a new townhouse in burlington, with excellent construction,  wood floors, beautiful open floor plan, stunning kitchen with granite countertops, high quality cabinets and, neutral, tasteful colors and a fenced yard.  Plus, the grounds are maintained.  Usually, I like to maintain, but this is a real treat and I am thoroughly enjoying.\n\nI recommend Piazza Realty Property Management in Burlington to anyone who is a friend.

Sometimes there are irreconcilable differences in the relationships between owner and renters. We understand that. We try to carry out our responsibilities to owners as close to letter as we can. We advise owners of situations and recommend solutions. Sometimes it just doesn't work out. In the end, we have to respect the requests of the property owner and follow the letter of law when it comes to rental agreements. Sometimes people being unhappy with us is the price we pay for Property Management. Thank you for your feedback. We take this very seriously. We are evaluating carefully to be sure there are not some areas of opportunity for improvement for us as well.We wish you the best."

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>This article highlights how Piazza Realty Property Management Inc. has been recognized for its efficient services and dedicated team members. Numerous user reviews commend the staff for their professionalism, mentioning that even less-than-perfect credit histories were accommodated with understanding and support. Piazza's ability to provide prompt resolution to maintenance concerns is consistently praised, with users expressing their gratitude for the timely interventions during emergencies such as power restorations after a storm. It's clear from the feedback that both property owners and tenants see the team as responsive and courteous, especially in cases where the firm has had to mediate between the two parties to ensure mutual satisfaction in complex situations.</p><p>Additionally, several long-term tenants speak highly of their experiences, noting that Piazza Realty fosters a congenial relationship with renters. For instance, multiple reviews highlight individuals like Kathy and Breanna for their dedication and the warm customer service they provide, which leaves customers feeling valued and respected. The company is also appreciated for its flexible and smooth application process, which many users note as a stress-free experience, setting Piazza Realty apart from other more rigid property management companies.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>A standout point in the article is Piazza Realty's dedication to creating a seamless rental experience for both tenants and property owners. User reviews commend the company for going above and beyond, especially in their handling of maintenance tasks swiftly and effectively. An example of this is a tenant who praised Piazza Realty for having repairs completed within hours of reporting a fallen tree impacting the power lines, highlighting the company's commitment to safety and comfort. These experiences reflect the company\u2019s capability to manage properties efficiently even under less-than-ideal circumstances.</p><p>Moreover, property owners also express satisfaction in how their investments are handled by Piazza Realty, underlining the management's proactive approach to upkeep and tenant relations. One owner noted that the managerial team at Piazza keeps them well-informed about property conditions and potential repairs, giving landlords peace of mind that their properties are in capable hands. The consensus among positive reviews seems to be that Piazza Realty prioritizes a customer-first ethos, ensuring that issues are flagged and resolved without unnecessary delay, which not only safeguards property value but also maintains tenant satisfaction.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>In contrast to the positives, the article also covers a number of unfavorable experiences encountered by clients of Piazza Realty Property Management Inc., primarily revolving around communication issues. Some tenants have reported a lack of responsiveness from the staff, with critical maintenance requests going unheeded for extended durations, leading to frustration and inconvenience. An illustrative case involves a tenant who faced persistent issues like faulty sinks and an unresolved rat infestation, which remained unaddressed for over three months despite repeated communications.</p><p>In addition to maintenance delays, several users have pointed out the administrative and procedural hurdles they faced during their interactions with Piazza Realty. Concerns were raised about the necessity for a double deposit and the perceived antiquity of some rental properties. Moreover, dissatisfaction was noted regarding the company's slow processing of applications, leaving potential tenants in an uncertain waiting period. These incidents suggest that while the company excels in certain areas, there are notable lapses that have left some clients considering alternative property management options.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The article acknowledges some of the more severe criticisms faced by Piazza Realty Property Management Inc., especially those highlighting what users perceive as unethical practices and poor treatment. Several user reviews have expressed anger over unreturned security deposits and cited instances where the company reportedly levied unwarranted charges for damages or services not rendered, including in cases where premises were left unclean at move-in. An account details how a tenant was sent to collections for disputed cleaning fees upon vacating a property, calling into question the company\u2019s professionalism.</p><p>Efforts to address disputes have also not been perceived positively by all users, as some report dismissive or condescending customer service experiences. Reviews highlight feeling discriminated against or treated unfairly, such as in a scenario where a prospective tenant felt sidelined possibly due to racial bias despite presenting a strong financial profile. This perception of partiality, coupled with inconsistent response times from management, has fueled a damaged reputation in certain circles, leading to suggestions for potential renters and landlords to proceed with caution when engaging with Piazza Realty. These experiences serve as critical areas for reflection and improvement for the company to restore trust and transparency in their business dealings.</p></section>"
