        "review": "These apartments get the job done, and while you aren't getting high quality, the prices are good for this area. When I moved into my unit last year, my unit contained fleas, which the property management company appeared to have known about. While the situation was handled promptly, it was an unpleasant experience for me, and irresponsible on their part to not inform me. Additionally, the carpets in my unit were absolutely atrocious looking, with numerous stains. The laundry machines are coin operated and do not work well, requiring several drying cycles before your clothes will actually dry. Some pros of this unit are that the one bedrooms pretty good in size, with it's best features probably being the balconey and it's convinient location to WWU. It's located right in front of a bus lines that goes up to WWU, and it's a month to month lease after six months. As a graduate student in a budget, I felt that these apartments served their purpose well. However, I would advise renters to just be aware of some of the issues I mentioned above too.",

        "review": "I love the community and area. This complex has ruined the experience Bellingham had to offer due to the unprofessional staff who chose to not abide by the RCW codes they so rudely told me to \"look up.\" On one hand they're billing me after sending emails stating the property is in my possesion while simultaneously entering the premise without a 30-day notice to remove personal property and change the locks. They also will not inform you of their policies unless at their discretion and do not allow complaints/grievances. I would not trust this establishment.",

The sentiments and information detailed below are based on user reviews and reflect the various experiences of tenants at Newport Apartments Bellingham. The summary aims to provide a balanced perspective that encompasses varying aspects of the user's feedback without revealing any identifiable information.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Good</h2>    </header>    <p>The Newport Apartments Bellingham have several features that residents appreciate, including reasonable pricing for the area which is deemed good for budget-conscious individuals. A highlight for tenants is the size of the one-bedroom units, which offer a good deal of living space, along with amenities like balconies which are seen as benefits to the living experience.</p>    <p>Additionally, the location of the apartments is found to be convenient, especially for students attending Western Washington University (WWU). Their proximity to a bus line that serves WWU and a flexible month-to-month lease option after an initial six-month tenure are aspects that have been positively noted by the community.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Great</h2>    </header>    <p>While no specific 'great' aspects were highlighted in the user reviews, the intent to swiftly address issues such as the presence of fleas in a new tenant's unit could be indicative of a responsive, albeit initially negligent, management approach. Despite this being an unwelcome find for a new resident, the fact that the situation was dealt with in a prompt manner may point towards an effort to rectify problems efficiently.</p>    <p>The residents' affinity for the communal aspect and the charm of the Bellingham area also contribute to the overall potential of living at Newport Apartments Bellingham. Even though some experiences with the apartment complex have been subpar, the inherent qualities of the locality itself can be considered among its great attributes.</p>  </chapter>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Bad</h2>    </header>    <p>Several problems have been identified by tenants that mar their experience at Newport Apartments Bellingham. Notably, one user review detailed an encounter with fleas upon moving into the unit, coupled with carpets that were heavily stained, which raises concerns about the standard of cleanliness and readiness of apartments for new tenants. Furthermore, issues with the on-site facilities, such as coin-operated laundry machines that require multiple cycles to dry clothes, reflect poorly on the property's maintenance.</p>    <p>Although the property management team was quick to address the flea issue for one tenant, perceptions of irresponsibility gain traction as no warning was provided beforehand. In addition, the lack of detail and notifications regarding property policies unless at the company's discretion points towards intermittent communication issues that can significantly impact the resident experience.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Ugly</h2>    </header>    <p>An overriding theme in the user reviews for Newport Apartments Bellingham highlights a distressing pattern of unprofessionalism and potential disregard for legal responsibilities by the property management staff. Instances where tenants are confronted with an apparent lack of compliance with RCW codes and advisement to personally \"look up\" these regulations are troublesome and indicative of poor customer service.</p>    <p>Furthermore, allegations of the property management team entering premises without the required 30-day notice, billing inconsistencies, and changing locks without due warning could be indicative of a severe lack of respect for tenant rights and privacy. The absence of a platform for complaints or grievances further adds to the notion of an establishment that may not prioritize tenant satisfaction or lawful conduct.</p>  </section></article>"
