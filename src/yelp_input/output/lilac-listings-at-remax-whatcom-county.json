        "review": "We decided to look for a home in Bellingham last year knowing very little about the area or market. As first time buyers with a lot of questions, Rachael guided us every step of the way, listening closely to our needs and providing us with honest answers. She is reliable, communicative, and extremely thorough. She also helped us obtain the home of our dreams. I highly recommend working with Rachael - you will not be disappointed!",

        "review": "Rachael is hands down a wonderfully fantastic, hard working Realtor that will always have your back.  I am a full-time Realtor in Southern California and interviewed several top producing agents in Bellingham Washington, and Rachael stood apart from all the others. My mom passed in December and my sister and I had made the very difficult decision of selling her property in WA from California.  I knew she was the right agent for us when she rolled up her sleeves and got on the floor to help fix our furnace.  She is very dedicated and takes pride in all she does. You will need well advised to have her in your corner. Thank you Rachael Wilson team for exceeding all expectations.",

        "review": "Was our lucky day when we called Rachael Wilson.  What a crazy market.  Everything we saw was pending before we could even call.  Rachel referred us to a loan officer to get pre qualified and ready when we found a home.  Before we knew it we had an offer in and she was an amazing negotiator on our behalf.  Since our offer was accepted her team has kept the ball rolling and taken care of every detail!  Thank you Rachael and team for a job well done.",

        "review": "Rachael was pleasant, professional, and helpful in selling our Bellingham property. She did little things that went a long way in feeling that she was 'working' for us and the positive outcome of a fast sale. She was always easily accessible and her team that works with her kept us informed of  all the steps in the process. She knows the market and if she doesn't know something will find an answer quickly to help get the job done.",

        "review": "My wife and I moved to Whatcom county from Portland, OR. We reached out to Laura based upon a recommendation prior to moving. Laura was a wonderful realtor, and she set us at ease. This was especially important since we were buying from a distance. We felt like we could trust her expertise of the  area, and rely on her for support and follow-up throughout the home buying process. We cannot recommend Laura enough to anyone looking to buy a home in the area. Her knowledge and experience coupled with the support of the great team she works with at Remax should give you confidence throughout your home buying process.",

        "review": "Rachael took the time to understand what we needed and wanted, and went the extra mile to help us get it. \nBefore moving to the area, we did a lot of research on realtors, and finally identified Rachael as a potential match to our needs and style of buying. But what really determined the fit was meeting with her in our advance trips and when we arrived: she asked insightful questions, truly listened to us, and gave us the confidence that she would be filtering and prioritizing houses that would be real possibilities, not just long lists of \"maybes\". This was proven over several months, when she showed us great candidates and collaborated with us to continuously refine our exact needs, in terms of location, size, view, condition, and other factors. \nAs it turned out, the house we purchased came on the market when I was  out of town due to a death in the family, and with only a day or two to make an offer, Rachael conducted a tour via Facebook video, so she, my wife, and I could look at every detail and discuss it real time. From there, she shepherded the offer and closing process with the greatest of professionalism and practical knowledge. \nRachael's in-depth knowledge of the area, real estate processes and standards, and contacts in inspection and service trades is invaluable. But what truly differentiates her is her passion for helping people find their perfect new home, and her personal energy and enthusiasm in working with her clients. She is a pleasure to work with, and you can have total confidence in her integrity and customer service.",

        "review": "I can't wait until its time to buy my next house, because I look forward to working with Rachael again! She made the whole process not only calm and smooth, but FUN. Her knowledge of not only the area, but the other key players in the area was unsurpassed. She was extremely flexible, and not at all pushy. Our story was unique, we had found we were moving to Bellingham for work and had a short window to do it in. The situation was compounded by the fact that I had recently had foot surgery, and my wife couldn't drive due to an injury. We picked a few houses, and Rachel picked the rest and last minute on a Friday, took us on a tour of 11 different homes. Some friends dropped us off at Rachel's Office, and she scooped us up into her car and drove us all around Bellingham, explaining the different neighborhoods and listing pros and cons while feeling out what we really were valuing as crucial. Of the 11 house, only 1 met our fancy, but it was the one thing we didn't want --- a fixer-upper. The next morning, Rachel called us and let us know, one way or another, an offer was getting accepted that day (only 3 days on the market). She was very patient, and even though we weren't putting the best offer in, she worked with us and did all the paperwork clearly and quickly. She called some people and told us we had a good shot, even bidding effectively list on a hot property. And she was right! We got the house. Even better, we were remote and because our timeline was so tight, we had to have people visiting the house constantly before (and right after) we closed, Rachel and her team were always happy to help us by meeting the contractors so we could move in as soon as possible! I cannot recommend her enough---Rachel made would could have been a very stressful situation easy-peazy",
