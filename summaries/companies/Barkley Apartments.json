      "review": "My experience closely matches Gretchen F.  By the time I moved in Sept 2017, the aforementioned property managers were gone and we had some nice ladies, Kathryn and Anne.  Kathryn was very understanding and would work with us within the limited scope she was able.  Anne was very very strict and by the books but fair in my opinion.  The owner is a company called Coast Management based out of Seattle. \n\nI initially rented a 750 sq ft 2 bed 2 bath with W/D, pet rent, utilities and a reserved parking spot for $1244/mo. It was a first floor middle unit with a nice view of the \"woods.\"  \n\nDeer would walk right past the giant glass sliding door and porch. They are cute, BUT deer are flea infested pests... so the first month we were there we had flea problems until we figured out we cannot open the back door and let the dogs enjoy the porch.  \n\nAfter the flea debacle we found out that the interior master bathroom had a serious mold problem.  No blame in the property managers the building design and position does not allow good air flow. As soon  as we found out they relocated us and sent in a professional for remediation. \n\nMoral of this story is to look at an apartment before you rent.\n\nWe stayed two years. It is not a bad place or a bad property management co.   When we left our 2 bedroom, 2 bath, with covered parking, dog rent and utilities would have been $1675 total...  I moved to Beverly Hills CA and found something comparable for $1900...  \n\nThe bad: It is getting expensive and not worth the quality or sustainable for the average salary in Bellingham. No one picks up their dog poop.  This is a Bellingham problem not just a Barkley problem.  Since this is like the only apartment complex that rents to people with dogs, the common grass areas smell like a kennel... it's not exactly a nice green space your kids can play in. \n\nThe good: They are renovating and updating everything.  The neighbors were all nice.  There were only a few bad owners with poorly trained/socialized dogs. The location is very convenient to stores, entertainment, bus lines, and hwys.",

      "review": "I moved from Buffalo, NY to Bellingham in August 2017 for a new job with just three weeks notice. Trying to find a pet friendly apartment within my budget in such a short time frame was not an easy task and I had to take what was available - that was at Barkley Trails. Cannot believe how expensive the rent is for the size of the apartment...$1150 + $25 water + $25 pet rent for a 622 sq. ft. one bedroom - it was literally the only thing they had available. It's in a convenient location (one mile from my job), it had a washer/dryer, and a dishwasher. Okay, should be fine...\n\nWhat a ripoff. As others have mentioned, forget coming home late. Even reserved parking spots may not be near your apartment. Half of the parking spots are normal sized (thankfully I could usually snag one of these) and half of them are so tiny I could barely squeeze out of my compact car! The dryer never worked completely, everything had to be run through twice. I suspect the outside vent needs to be cleaned. The two baseboard heaters were the least efficient heating elements I've ever experienced - and expensive! I could not believe the cost of my electric bills over the winter! \n\nI freely admit, my rent was late three time during my lease. I had some car issues that were very costly. However, my rent was always paid by the following paycheck, in full, with late fees. They make things extra confusing by leaving two notices stapled together on your door. One says you have three days to pay, one says ten days. It wasn't until the very last one that I discovered the three days is to pay the base rent ($1125) and the ten days is to pay the other charges and late fees. I received notice at the end of June that they were electing not to renew my lease beginning in August - not an eviction, just choosing not to renew.\n\nI just received my \"refund\" on my security deposit and refundable pet fee ($350 of the pet fees are refundable, $150 is non-refundable). They kept $120 of the security deposit to cover \"lightly sanitizing\" the floors! What the heck?! I'm assuming this is because of my pet, but anywhere else I've lived, that is the entire purpose of the non-refundable pet fee: to cover the cleanings associated after moveout. What a joke. \n\nShould also mention that despite the lease stating that you can't leave garbage outside the front doors or smoke on your balcony, neither of these things are enforced. My neighbors routinely left multiple bags of garbage outside their door for days at a time, attracting many bugs. People also smoke everywhere, to the point where it was a nuisance to open the windows in my living area. \n\nI am so relieved to be out of that place. I've found a beautiful condo to rent directly from the owner, with no extra pet fees and a reserved parking space steps from the entrance of the condo. Two bedrooms and it's $100 cheaper per month than the Barkley Apartments! \n\nI will gladly take part in any communication with the Attorney General as others have mentioned. It seems management staff changed again about halfway through my lease and the new people were even worse than the previous ones.",

      "review": "After reading the previous reviews I 1000% agree with them. Starting with we weren't given a paper copy of the lease. Origionally i was told it was emailed to me but since I never got it, she had me sign on the computer in the office, and was told they'd get it to us. We constantly had to have maintenance called for repairs, our dryer (needed to be ran 3-4 times to dry) took them 3 times to come \"fix\" and we gave up asking. We had toilet issues that were reported from the day we moved in until a month before we moved out, again never fixed.\nSomeone before us had painted the walls different colors and the patch jobs done were terrible, we got wall art to cover it all up. Yet they claim they repaint the whole apartment between renters. \n Open parking is terrible if you come home late, we paid the extra money for reserved spaces after one night of waiting 45 min to find a spot not even near our building. When people parked in our paid spots they left it up to us to find out who the car owners were. \n  We complained about birds in the vents in Febuary which caused noise super early in the mornings, we were told they clean them out every August and would just have to wait. We spent the last day of our lease cleaning the apartment. We left it clean as opposed to when we moved in and found trash on the floors, dirty counters/floors/refrigerator/oven. Yet we still got charged $135 for cleaning because a fly was found in the window and some of the blinds were dirty in spite of the fact the blinds needed replacing. When we turned our stuff in she was brushing us off so she could talk to the maintenance guys and didn't do our final walk through with us. Yet when we asked about why were being charged the amount for cleaning she asked why we didn't do the walk through with her. We reminded her that we tried notifying her about the disuse when we turned in the keys and parking passes but she was too busy to deal with us and kept saying all that stuff is just routine repairs, it's not big deal. \n\n$300 dollars of our deposit wasn't consideredrefundable we understand that, yet they held back more than they should have for an absurd reason. It's incredibly frustrating when you're given the run around for no reason, and when you're mis-led by the staff. In the end we were told we can't dispute the charges because they already cut us a check and it's final. Never mind the only way for us to know the charges was to get the check. \n\nOther than that stuff, the neighbors were decent, but the dog owners were terrible about picking up the poop.  We needed a place to live and didn't have much time to find one so we landed here. If we ever rent again, we will research better, but it won't be with this company.",

      "review": "Thank you, Laine W. I agree with every word you posted! When we moved out at the end of April 2017,  we left the apartment cleaner than the first day we moved in. I was expecting to get all of my deposit back but they held $75.00 because of dirt in the window tracks! The window tracks were cleaned with a vacuum and small brush. Unfortunately for Barkley, I have pictures. You can use my name if the Attorney General should contact you! I have many complaints which I brought to Lauren's attention and also had to contact Jeannie Torchia because of Lauren Kennedy condescending attitude!",

      "review": "in our current climate of change posting this is the best activism available for renters as the laws are bent for the landlords.\n\nWe lived at Barkley Trails for 6 years. The first four was not bad. (last two years had to do with bad upstairs tenants). In September 2016 management changed. The person who reviewed the current management is correct. They are young, arrogant, entitled, rude, condescending. biased, insensitive and fraudulent. Their boss is Jeannie Torchia torchia@coastmgt.com (425) 405-1340 . The manager, Lauren Kennedy blatantly lied about our move out. I have filed complaints with the Attorney General. This was to keep a public record of their practices. Do not expect justice from them, but move on and have your justice in finding a better place to live. **note: previous manager Amanda was at least fair. Amanda told me directly we would have all our deposit returned because we had been there so long. Lauren Kennedy tacked on fees to \"sand\" the nail patches in each room. I am meticulous and know they did not need sanding. I honored the lease, filling the holes as required by the lease. She was looking for reasons to hold back deposits. She charged us for a blind we had them in to fix that they couldn't fix. They claimed something was broken and had to be replaced. If it were broken I would have reported it to them. After six years there was wear and tear as is expected in long term living, but nothing out of the ordinary. When Coast management bought the property they used our apartment to help sell it because of the way I had it decorated and kept it. I know Lauren Kennedy fraudulently withheld most of our deposit. Report every little thing in writing. Coast Management also own Brampton Apartments in Bellingham, WA. One thing they do, if you are not section 8, is lie at your move out to hold back your deposit to make up the losses with the section 8 renters. They also tried to get approval to charge for water and sewer independently of the rent but the county denied this because of all the section 8 tenants they have there. They owe me money. No two ways about it. It is a debt that will go unpaid.  Keep records and diaries. Resist minimizing and avoid \"benefit of the doubt\" with these landlords. Report it all in writing. Again:  Jeannie Torchia torchia@coastmgt.com (425) 405-1340",

      "review": "I pay $1272.00 for a 2 bedroom apartment and I cannot wait to move, these are the worst apartments I've ever lived in. The staff is rude and incompetent and totally apathetic when you call with any issues. There are 2 maintenance people; cheaper apartments in town have 5 generally. They don't keep the property well maintained. Our car was stolen, it was broken into twice. The Barkley neighborhood sucks and people moving here need to know that, because the managers will tell you how safe and nice it is. I loathe this place and am super looking forward to moving out.",

      "review": "Beware, of being seduced into thinking these are well built apartments. Built in 2002, so you might think that the noise level between upper and lower apartments isn't going to be so annoying. It is annoying, and in general will sound like an elephant is above you. If you have noisy neighbors below you that fight or argue, you will hear it even through the carpeting and floor. The refrigerator/freezers are terrible. Very small freezer space and if you fill it, you will have problems. \n\nYour lease is going to be very long, over 10 pages (get a lawyer to review it), and there are many unfair conditions. When the time comes to move out, you will have management bringing \"god knows who\" into your apartment up to 20 days before you leave with only 24 hour notice, whether you are there or not.  \n\nIf you don't want to be in buildings with pets (thus fleas), they will tell you that there is another building that doesn't allow pets. You might want to rent there: beware they don't tell you that they allow any person who claims a disability to have a pet in that building, so there could still be fleas. \n\nThey say no smoking is allowed in or near apartments, but they allow smoking near the balconies, so if smoke bothers you don't plan on having your non-air conditioned apartment windows open during hot summer. After your lease is over if you want to stay on month to month your rent could go up by almost $200/month. They want to move people in and out; can you guess why?\n\nThe nicest thing about this place is being able to hear frogs in the spring if you are in an apartment on the backside by the woods. You'll spend a lot more for heat on this side. If you end up on a ground floor, you'll never be able to open your windows, as anyone can park in front of your apartment and at night the car lights will shine in.",

  "summary": "# Barkley Apartments: A Balanced Review\n\nIn this article, we delve into the varied experiences of residents at Barkley Apartments, based on user reviews gathered from different sources. These perspectives aim to present a comprehensive picture of life at the apartment complex without breaching privacy by revealing reviewer identities. This article's intent is to function as a tool to aid readers in their search for a property management company or rental property.\n\n## The Good\n\nBarkley Apartments has garnered praise for certain aspects from a minority of residents. One user notes the apartment's pet-friendly policy and the responsiveness of management as positives alongside appreciating the apartment's location and size for the price paid. Another resident acknowledges the presence of wildlife around the complex, illustrating the unique charm of living adjacent to nature, and the act of quick relocation by management upon discovering a mold issue shows that they can be responsive in certain situations.\n\nThe neighbors at Barkley Apartments are frequently described as pleasant, creating a community vibe that is friendly and inclusive. Additionally, some residents have noted the conveniences offered by the complex's location with stores, entertainment, bus lines, and highways all easily accessible. These features contribute to an appealing living situation for some tenants.\n\n## The Great\n\nIn this section, we attempt to highlight standout features or incidents; however, user reviews provide limited material to classify as 'great'. The efforts of the property management to renovate and update facilities were positively mentioned. This shows a commitment to improving the living conditions, albeit not extensively acknowledged across the reviews.\n\nWhile 'great' experiences are sparse in the user reviews, it\u2019s important to recognize the property management\u2019s willingness to relocate residents when serious issues like mold were reported. These measures suggest that when problems are properly acknowledged, the management can act appropriately to rectify them.\n\n## The Bad\n\nDespite some positive remarks, residents have voiced numerous concerns. From minor annoyances like inconvenient parking to more serious issues such as maintenance neglect, Barkley Apartments has its share of challenges. Many residents report an upsurge in rent prices that don't align with the quality of living or local salary averages. Mismanagement of pet waste is a recurrent gripe, alluding to hygiene issues on the premises.\n\nInsights from multiple user reviews disclose a pressing theme of poor building maintenance. Complaints of broken appliances that go un-addressed, ineffective heating systems, and problematic parking situations depict an environment where resident wellness might be overlooked. The frustration over perceived unresponsiveness to repair requests underscores the sense of neglect some residents feel.\n\n## The Ugly\n\nThe ugliest aspects of the Barkley Apartments experience, as reflected in user reviews, relate significantly to financial dealings and lease management. Residents report substantial portions of their security deposits being unjustly retained, citing insufficient reasons like \"lightly sanitizing floors\" or minor dirt in window tracks. This practice has left several users feeling cheated and distressed.\n\nMoreover, residents describe the lease terms as excessively lengthy and potentially unfair, with management being accused of invasive practices like unwelcome apartment showings prior to lease end. Management's manner in these incidents is often characterized as dismissive or inconsiderate, expanding the rift between resident expectations and reality. The trend of inconsistent management, coupled with reported challenges ranging from noise to pest infestation, paint a bleak picture of living at Barkley Apartments.\n\nPlease note that while these reviews are generated by ChatGPT, your own diligence is essential when considering a property management company or rental property; user experiences can greatly vary, and it's crucial to explore these entities personally."
