      "review": "My partner, brother, and I called this complex to gather more information for a 2 bed/1 bath unit as we are planning to move to Washington in the next few months. We were in the process of being put on the wait list when they asked \"Will it be a family moving in?\" When we explained it would be us three she immediately told us that they wouldn't be able to accept us. We were confused because my partner and I have been living in other apartment units in California together for the past three years and have had no issues regarding us not being a hetero-normative married couple. We further asked why that was an issue and she explained that they've had problems with people breaking leases that made it difficult for the property management. We were trying to explain how discriminatory this sounded while explaining our situation and she said, \"Well this isn't the right place for you then\" and hung up. I have never had an experience quite as homophobic as this. If possible to give a 0 star I would.",
