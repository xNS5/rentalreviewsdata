        "review": "Worst property management company. We left the place we rented spotless and they withheld upwards of $500 from us. We were only in the place one year and were assigned a new property manager halfway through the year who never saw the property. I asked for an itemized list of what the costs were and they would not provide. Aside from their unprofessional manner they handled the situation, there was never a walkthrough done with us before or after we left. Would definitely not recommend as I believe we were cheated out of hundreds of dollars.",

The lease allowed cleaning only if we left the property dirty and we provided an extensive number of photos proving the property did not need cleaning (we spent hours scrubbing the house and leaving it clean). We asked them what needed to be cleaned by them and they were unable to answer that and said that since the cleaners were already paid there is no way to refund us. I would not rent through them again given what feels like a deceptive and dishonest business practice.",

        "review": "House was supposedly being actively managed by Optimus (Suzzanne Medina). Took the house back after several years as a rental and found several problems that had never been mentioned.  Some examples:\n\n1. No pets allowed: Renters obviously had a cat that severely urinated in several rooms. Had to rip out all flooring, baseboards, curtains.  The intensity (after cleaning) indicates it had been going on for a while.  \nObviously no one monitors the property well enough to know what's going on with the property.  \nCleaning had been done by Optimus but the stench was still overwhelming and NO mention was ever made of this problem.\n\n2. Inside door to the garage had been kicked in at some point as the frame was split, door cracked around the latch, latch plate area destroyed and plate gone.  The quality of the repair was apparently someone just driving two nails into the frame to try to hold the splintered wood together.\n\n3. Myriad of smaller poorly done repairs and ignored broken items NONE of which had ever been detailed to us.  \n*Microwave door had been damaged so it wouldn't latch.  I guess you can use it by standing there and holding the door shut with your hand while it runs.  \n*Toilet handle/lever was wrong.  Its on an angled part of the tank and the wrong handle with a straight arm was used so the arm scrapped the inside of the tank.  It bound up when flushed so the handle never pops back.  After the renters moved out the toilet had been running for a solid month in the midst of local water restrictions.\n*Outside outlet box had come loose due to damaged wooden plate and was hanging out of the wall.\n*Furnace had not been inspected in over 4 years per maintenance label.\n*Mold (light but still mold) growing in the master bath shower upper wall/ceiling.\n*Bottom of a kitchen cabinet drawer was separated from the back and was coming apart.\n\nYou get the picture.  Choose wisely if you actually want a management company that actively looks out for the property.",

As I have 44 years of apartment operating experience I am used to disgruntled tenant voices. It's just what happens even if the property is managed well.\n At our property Suzzanne has aided in roof and gutter cleaning, complete repair of the building drainage system, a parking lot reseal and restripe, deck repair and painting, a complete hallway painting including colorful doors and new base trim, new hallway carpet, heater repairs, broken window seal repairs, numerous flooring jobs, a re-cert of the fire alarm system, replacing a tub/shower enclosure and catching up to 2+ years of deferred maintenance. Vacancies have been promptly filled. A job well done and that's just the first 6 months!",

        "review": "Do NOT use this rental company. Suzanne, the lady I worked with was very slow at getting repairs done for the year I rented through them. I had to fully clean the place before I moved in, removing drug paraphernalia and painting the WHOLE condominium myself. Upon move out, she preceded to charge me for things such as putting closet doors back on track and an OLD shower head!!! This place was a dump when I moved in and I left it 1000x better upon move out. She doesn't \"do,\" a move out walk through with you and conveniently LOST my move in check list. What a horrible experience this was. Although, I did learn a lot about renting through this rental company, and am highly motivated to buy now......I still feel sick to my stomachache.",

        "review": "As a tenant I recently vacated a residence being managed by this company. I must advised they are poor communicators, with no response or calls returned. I dealt with Julia who failed to communicate that my security deposit had been returned to me on a specific date. What I received was \"your security deposit was returned a copy of days ago.\" however they never asked for an address to send the deposit. In addition, when asked where it was sent, the response was \"the last known address\". Again, what did they consider the last known address?? I called to inquire when email was not returned but was unable to speak with Julia, she was supposedly in a meeting with the owners??  I left a voicemail. Shortly after received an email that indicated that it had been sent to the address which I had just vacated.  Does that really make sense, or is this just a ploy to delay.  Would have been more professional to advise me of the date the deposit was sent,  as well as the address it was sent to. Unfortunately it was similar to what is referred to as pulling teeth to get a simply answer. \nI hope that you do not have to experience but I am guessing you will.",

They sync up with our team like a dream. And kindness? Double check. When tech gremlins attacked, they didn't just stand by; they dove into the trenches with us, showing patience and support that would make your grandma proud.\n\nBut it's not all serious business. Their team has a way of making even the driest property management talk feel like a chat over coffee. They've mastered the art of being pros while keeping it light and human, which in my book, makes them property management rockstars. If you're on the hunt for a property management crew that brings both brains and heart to the table, along with a few laughs, look no further than Optimus Property Solutions. They're not just managing properties; they're elevating the game.\"",

She is always calm and clear with her expectations and that is vital as sometimes emotions can run a little high if issues arise! She is definitely very good at her job in that way, I can truly attest to that. I think lots of the issues we've dealt with in our park have been outside of the scope of Optimus' management of the park. While that's been hard to navigate, it's not their fault. She has shown that she cares and is willing to work with people, especially us. We know that she didn't need to be as understanding and patient as she has been with us over the years, and since our livelihood literally depends on it, we are grateful to her for sure.",

Recently Julia came by  and was taking pictures of the house and my wife asked what's going on thinking it was the HOA. Unfortunately the reply my wife gets is \" mind your own f@#$ business\". So my wife takes a few pictures of her just in case and Julia stops her truck, sticks her head out and rudely shouts \"you want me to get  out and pose?\"  I then called and headed to the office to have a conversation with Gary I believe..by the time I arrived office was closed and no one was there @1pm.. interesting how 10 minutes was a hard time to wait for me to arrive?

Tenants and homeowners mentioned that some personnel were approachable, responsive, and capable of addressing concerns such as roof and gutter cleaning, heater repairs, and dealing efficiently with vacancies. In particular, positive interactions were noted with staff members who managed to conduct smooth transitions and showed patience during stressful situations, indicating a level of competence and attentiveness to customer service.</p><p>Furthermore, several property owners expressed satisfaction with the thorough services provided, such as identifying and facilitating necessary repairs or improvements to their properties. Positive feedback highlighted that the company went beyond the expected to provide quality service, handle maintenance issues promptly, and were thoughtful in their communications with tenants, showcasing their commitment to property care and tenant relations.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>User reviews highlighted instances where Optimus Property Solutions excelled in their responsiveness and professional conduct. They assisted with several functional and aesthetic updates to properties, from resealing parking lots to hallway renovations, indicating a capacity for effective property upgrades. Positive experiences with staff members\u2014who were often described as kind, understanding, and willing to work with clients\u2014reflected well on the company, offering assurance that good property management services are not only necessary but also appreciated by tenants and property owners alike.</p><p>Furthermore, contractors such were impressed with the team's combination of professionalism and human touch, emphasizing the importance of relationship-building within the realm of property management. Their contributions have not gone unnoticed, painting Optimus Property Solutions as a company that can provide great value to those looking for effective management and timely resolution of issues.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>On the flip side, some users have reported undesirable experiences, mainly pointing towards issues such as poor communication and neglect of maintenance concerns. Tenants have voiced frustrations about unresponsive management when it comes to addressing repair requests or even basic inquiries. For example, dissatisfaction stemmed from experiences where it took an inordinately long time to receive replies from the management, if at all, creating a perceived lack of transparency and attentiveness to tenant needs.</p><p>Issues like wrongful eviction allegations, ignored discomforts such as lack of ventilation in the properties, and long-standing maintenance requests that were allegedly unfulfilled for years have tainted the company's reputation in the eyes of certain customers. These accounts emphasize the need for effective and timely communication as an essential element of property management\u2014a requirement that, according to these user reviews, was not consistently met by Optimus Property Solutions.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The ugly aspects of some of the user reviews centered heavily on the handling of security deposits, accusations of deceitful business practices, and a lack of professional respect. Tenants reported losing significant portions of their security deposits for unclear or unjustified reasons, mentioning a lack of itemized deductions and a failure to provide requested information. Additionally, the absence of property walkthroughs, both pre-move-in and post-move-out, further contributed to tenants' distrust and feelings of being cheated by the company.</p><p>Property owners also recounted neglect in property management duties, including serious issues such as undetected pet damage, incomplete and subpar repairs, and insufficient property inspections. These examples suggest a pattern where Optimus Property Solutions may have fallen seriously short of their duties, culminating in significant financial and personal distress for both tenants and property owners, thus deeply impacting the company\u2019s overall standing in their eyes.</p></section>"
