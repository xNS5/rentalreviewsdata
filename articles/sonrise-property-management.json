        "review": "worst management in all of Bellingham area. the landlords have dodge my emails and phone calls ask why they haven't fixed a roof leak which has cause mold to grow, it has been 2 months and going. A soon as we got a hold of someone we got hit with a 'we decided to now renew your lease\" we have told them about our own dog being attacked by our neighbors aggressive poodle and had go out a buy a gun so if the guys dog tries to attack again we now have the right to shoot to kill his dog! now the property owners deserves to be held accountable for these unhabitable living conditions! All this happened in the last 2 years I been living here and my former roommate has moved out. All Son-Rise says \"well since you were on a partial moveout were not going to look at any of your maintenance requests\" SON-RISE property does discriminate against!\n\noh their new maintance guy is shitty! says if he has to come in a fix something  that isn't needing to be fixed he will falsely report as we broke it.",

A week passed and my son still had no place to live in Bellingham. I let go of Son-Rise and spat the bad taste from my mouth. What would Jesus do?

        "review": "***I'll preface this by saying that we are not the type of people who post negative feedback on a public site, quite the contrary actually. We understand that humans are imperfect, and that we all are trying our best, but we want to warn the rest of the Bellingham community to stay away from Son-Rise.***\n\nThis was the worst experience I've ever had at a property management. My husband and I applied for a house with Son-Rise, along with one of our friends as a roommate. After 3 days of silence post submission of our applications, we reached out only to hear that we had \"missing items\" from our application. (This struck me as unprofessional, and awkward seeing that I was the one who had to seek THEM out to hear what I was missing versus the other way around.) Two days after we retrieved the missing items from our application, (items weren't even really missing, just lost in their emails) I called them back to see what our status was (since I didn't ever get a call from them) and found out there was yet ANOTHER item we were \"missing.\" Twice I had to reach out to find what we owed. Twice they were vague about the items we needed to complete this process. After two more weeks of playing tag with this property management, we found out we needed a co-signer. After we sent in the application for the co-signer, they reached out (FINALLY) saying we needed to track down our rental reference, because they themselves couldn't get ahold of them. It has been another week since we got all of the loose ends tied up, and we still have not heard back from Son-Rise about the property. Not only was our time and money wasted, it was unappreciated. Such an awful experience with a property manager who couldn't care less about the livelihood of future tenants.",

        "review": "This review is specifically for Virginia who works for Son-Rise. Virginia is the property manager for a condo I had lived in up until recently. She is horrible at her job and should be removed from her position immediately. She takes sides in neighbor disputes and is the most condescending and rude a hole I have ever had the misfortune of speaking with. The way that she speaks to people (and I am one of four other people who have said similar things about her) is never okay in any situation, but as someone who works for the owners of the condo she should definitely not be rude to owners. If you ask her a question, she acts like the whole world is falling apart and speaks to you like you're a child. Selling the condo was the best thing I ever did, and I celebrate never having to look at her or speak to her again. Cheers!!",

        "review": "I rented two units from SonRise in two years; both in the 808s. I have found the staff to be courteous and helpful both on the phone and in person. I had appliances break (dishwashers) in each apartment. They were replaced promptly and it was not taken out of my deposit. They were lenient and charged no fee for the one time we were late paying rent. It was only a day late, but still.  I got my full deposit back (minus like $10) from each house. The key is to remember the details; windows and sills, behind appliances, inside cabinets, etc. They give you a list, it's super easy. \n\nThe two problems I ever had both involved the parking lot. 1) SonRise will never call a tow-truck company to move cars without passes. 2) When it snows they do not shovel and only sometimes salt. If you plan on living in one of their units take some initiative and sweep/shovel your own stairs and walk ways and move your cars to street parking when the flakes start falling if you want to get out the next morning.",

        "review": "Ok you guys this is beyond the worst management company I've ever dealt with! I have rented at places in Miami, Los Angeles, Laguna Beach and Scottsdale which all are high well educated places. Ever since I started renting from this company it's been nothing but a hassle first week of renting their asked to up my rent because they had made a mistake on the price and asked for more money? Then I had signed a six-month lease with the option to renew for another year after living here for 60 days they had told me the owner is selling the place and I will not be able to re-sign my lease for another year. And then as a renter it is my job to maintain the yard as in no trash don't make it look sloppy if my grass is a little too long that's my opinion and I have got asked to cut the grass for the realtor to stage photos which I will be leaving in 10 days and I'm traveling in those 10 days while trying to move there telling me if I don't they're taking it out of my damage deposit which isn't right. I have a life and my life isn't mowing the grass if it's too long as a realtor or management company that's their responsibility they think it's out of control.  There all under graduated people working there that I don't think know what they're talking about and their guessing they're rude not respectful people. Please never rent from them you will regret it and get taken advantage of!",

        "review": "Lived in one of their brand new houses for a total of 2 years. As for bothering tenants they are fine, barely interacted with us. Yet the company is extremely unprofessional. To start, we were told when moving in \"We installed wood chips so that yard work will not be involved with the house\" then later received a notification that we needed to remove weeds that were growing. Glad they gave us an unusable heinous yard yet still expected us to maintain it like it was grass. They did inform us 24 hours in advance of yearly inspection, but they never informed us when the owner would randomly show up. A few times the owner would show up at our door without giving us any prior knowledge and inform us he was there to replace a filter or something (we always let him in because the owner is actually a super awesome guy, son-rise is the problem). We also informed them that our glass chandelier broke when our tall roommate hit it with his head, they never helped us fix or replace it, yet charged us at the end. We told them we were moving out 3 months before the end of the lease, which they forgot about until we had to remind them 10 days before our move-out. Now for the real KICKER: we put a couple thousand dollars down in the deposit. When we moved out we asked them when we would receive it. They said \"we have 21 days until we have to send it\". A month later I asked where it was and there response was \"Since no one informed us of an address to send it to, we mailed it to the house you leased from us.\" YES! Son-rise mailed an extremely valuable check to a VACANT house which is up for rent even though they have permanent addresses from the 3 people on the lease. Communicating with this company slightly feels like you are talking to a kindergarten class. Nice in person but I swear to god, behind closed doors they are as chaotic as a propane factory hosting a fireball juggling tournament. Bellingham rental companies are not the best and take advantage of college kids, so pick your poison.",

We had a signed lease saying no one could enter our apartment unless we were home, that doesn't mean anything to them or at least the people they have working for them, maintenance guys where in our apartment while we were out to come home and them be in our bedroom saying they were fixing the doors? Nothing was wrong with bedroom doors and we didn't okay it. Worse one was when one maintenance guy let himself in and sat on the couch watching tv with my 7year old son while i was taking a shower, VERY MESSED UP, again entered without any permission or warning. Last but not lease they don't keep there word for anything. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. rent from someone else. 1800 Alabama Street threw Son-Rise is the worse place to rent in Bellingham.

They will constantly give us two different answers, and then we're stuck in the middle trying to figure out who is right. After making the drive up from Seattle to close out my part of the lease, I came back to find out that they needed me to sign something else. This was extremely frustrating, and I think that they need to develop some sort of standardization for their moves, since they currently don't seem to know the process (which is one that they are constantly dealing with) for move outs.

Our house was in terrible shape when we moved in, big holes in the wall, weird stains, wood floors that give you splinters, and the house was white but covered in filth. \"We're the dirty house on the corner\" we would say. But it was cheap and in a good location. It wasn't until we started getting harassing emails about our lawn needing mowed that we started to realize that their quality of professionalism is as cheap as the rent. We mowed our lawn every few weeks but they kept charging us as if they had to pay someone for lawn service. When we moved out we cleaned the house and garage way better than it was before we moved in. They charged us for 12 hours of 'cleaning', batteries, carpet cleaning (there was one room with carpet) and other random fees I've never experienced before. We made sure all batteries and lights worked before we left, and We scrubbed that housed. I called them and they were extremely rude, told me they couldn't do a walk through with us because someone else had moved in already. And then hung up on me. Very Christ like. I went over to the house, it was empty and all the windows were open. I peaked in and the house had definitely not had 12 hours of anything done to it since we left nor was anyone living there yet.",

When we moved out they kept half of our deposit for cleaning even though we thoroughly scrubbed the house and I have never had my deposit withheld from previous landlords. They put a bill on our account in error, told us twice that they would remove it since they agreed it was in error, never took it off, and then deducted that from our deposit as well. The most frustrating part however was how incredibly and consistently condescending they were to us, constantly referring to us as \"kids\" and \"college students\" when my roommates and I are graduate students and teachers in our late 20's and early 30's. They seemed to think we were idiots who had never rented before. When I informed them that the house had mold (our lease said that they would take care of mold) they kept telling me that it probably wasn't mold and I was just confused about what mold looked like. If you do rent from them be sure to well document everything and get things in writing, especially if you are younger since they seem to see that as an opportunity to take advantage of you. \nMight be helpful:\nhttp://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights",

As we prepared to move out we began to find out about all the extra fees and cleaning charges they require you to pay (even if you leave your apartment spotless). This would have been fine if they had been outright about it from the start but all we got was sweet talking and patronizing lectures. They have truly been quite rude to us. Basically, this is just another one of those realty companies that does whatever possible to take money from defenseless tenants. When  we finally moved out they ended up charging us for the time the apartment was vacant even though we had specifically asked them if they would only charge us to the day we vacated. Again, all I ask is that you say things outright and not twist legal language to your profit, is that too much to ask. These are sleazy untrustworthy people, don't do business with them.",

I can provide proof for nearly all of my issues below. \nHere is why I would steer clear of Son-Rise:\n- Unit was never cleaned prior to moving in\n- Water stains on floor of unit had not been fixed as I was told they had been\n- Dishwasher never worked properly\n- Numerous light bulbs were burned out when I moved in\n- Fixing my hot water heater took 3 visits from two different maintenance men\n- A bullet hole that occurred in my wall was never repaired. At first I was told it would be my cost to fix as it was not a result of the units owner. When I pressed the issue, Son-Rise agreed to fix it at their cost. It was never repaired while I lived in the unit.\n- Upon terminating my lease (admittedly late, but only by three days) I was responsible for September's rent (moved out in August). Within the rights of Washington Landlord-Tenant law.\n- Paid September rent knowing our unit had been viewed by multiple people and an application had been submitted prior to the end of August.\n- Was never informed when a new lease was signed (When a new lease is signed, I would be due a prorated amount of September's rent).\n- I found out a new renter was in the unit when I contacted the energy company to arrange my last bill.\n- I was only refunded rent when I contacted Son-Rise and pressed the issue about the rent as well as some absurd charges made on my deposit (fire alarm batteries for $45?)\n-Oh, beware of the automatic $25 taken out of your deposit as \"Administrative Fee\"\n\nSome other items to be warned about are the poorly written lease (several sections seem to say one thing, but Son-Rise interprets them another). The company overworks their employees (in my opinion) and this slows down all action on maintenance requests outside of legally required responses (so water/electric/heat) as well as any inquiries. I could continue, but would begin entering my personal feelings and not fact. The only reason that I gave Son-Rise two stars is that the rent was easily cheaper by $100 a month than elsewhere and that they did end up refunding the rent due to me in addition to most of the charges to my deposit (and I still contend they owe me all but the $25, but getting that would cost me a lawyer and that costs more than the other charges)",

We are licensed and bonded just to note. On the phone to the front desk lady I was calling in my plumbing issue and asked ya know \"hey I work at Gary's Plumbing and Heating and is there anyway...\" Didn't even get to finish my sentence before she cut me off and said \"they have to be licensed and bonded\" and I said \"Oh of course they are..\" cut off again I got to hear \"Um yea, so no\". Rude much? And when she asked is it okay for us to enter your home while you're not there and I said no, I'd would like to be there, she almost sounded like \"well.....okaaaaay\". Yes, well okay...do not enter my home without my permission while I am not there. End of story. So now I'm a little apprehensive whether they will actually follow what I asked and hope I don't show up from work to see someone I don't know in my house.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In the context of local property management, Son-Rise has received some commendations from tenants who have had positive experiences with the company. A few tenants have reported professional and courteous interactions with staff while addressing concerns and that maintenance requests, when made, were handled in a timely manner. These isolated cases indicate that Son-Rise has the potential to provide satisfactory service, given the right circumstances.</p><p>Furthermore, there are instances where tenants have successfully retrieved the majority of their security deposits, which is a noteworthy positive, considering the common issues surrounding deposit returns. Tenant experiences vary, but those who meticulously adhered to checklist details upon move-out found the process straightforward and were met with fair treatment regarding their deposits.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Amidst the critiques, it's important to acknowledge the instances where Son-Rise Property Management has excelled. Tenants have cited experiences where the staff was helpful and approachable, assisting them through the rental process. Taking over an existing lease was made uncomplicated for some, and any maintenance issues raised were quickly addressed and resolved satisfactorily by Son-Rise.</p><p>Positive experiences were marked by prompt communication from the property management. For some renters, there was leniency shown regarding late payments and appreciation expressed for the ease of online rent payments. These small gestures of good service can make a significant difference in the tenant-landlord relationship, representing the high points of interacting with the company.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>On the other hand, some user reviews point towards a worrying trend of unprofessionalism within the company. Examples include inconsistent information being provided by staff, which caused confusion and frustration for tenants. Additionally, there are reports of significant delays and unresponsiveness to application queries and maintenance issues, contributing to a negative perception of Son-Rise Property Management's operations.</p><p>In certain reviews, tenants narrate how their maintenance concerns went unaddressed for extended periods, detrimentally affecting their quality of living. Concerns over aspects like lawn maintenance and unwarranted additional clean-up fees also paint a picture of a company that could be more attentive to tenant rights and respectful communication.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The \u201cugly\u201d side of Son-Rise Property Management\u2019s service is a portrayal of disappointment and frustration echoed in several reviews. There were alarming reports of staff entering apartments without permission, which is a severe violation of privacy and indicates a lack of professional boundaries. Furthermore, a disturbing account from a tenant highlights an unsettling scenario where a maintenance worker entered the property unauthorized and interacted inappropriately with a minor.</p><p>Add to that the accusations from users about the property management withholding a significant portion of security deposits without clear justification and providing a poor level of cleanliness and maintenance in their properties. These distressing experiences reflect a dire need for improvement in the way Son-Rise conducts business and respects its tenants' rights and well-being.</p></section>",
