Once the building filled up, I could hear my neighbor sneeze next door and use the bathroom. \n\nThey don't maintain the property. It's a mess. They don't even clear/de-ice the stairs in the winter. \n\nUpon move out, we CLEANED. It was absolutely spotless. We received $96.00 out of $1000.00 deposit. Apparently we left the apartment a mess. I would NEVER recommend living there.",

        "review": "These apartments suck!!  They are glittery on the outside but are carelessly built and very poorly run.  If you want to live in an expensive ghetto with riff raff for neighbors and an ignorant not present manager than this is the place for you.  Loud neighbors, with lots of rules but no one to enforce them.",

        "review": "The apartments were ok when they were brand new . Physically the apartments are cheap and have a \"mass produced\" feel. By that I mean the plumbing is finicky and there are funny design flaws all over (exposed pipes, malfitting cabinets). The building I was in had almost no insulation. I could literally hear one neighbor sneez, and I knew when video game time came around for my other neighbor (this is all while I was watching TV). However other buildings were reportedly better in that aspect. There is minimal storage. Since the new manager came around the quality of people has dropped dramatically. I love kids, however, the kids at these apartments are largely unsupervised and leave their toys all over. On more than one occasion I had to move bikes so I could leave the parking lot. Trash blows around alot until the landscaping guy brings his kids to pick it up once a week, a few months out of the year. When I moved out at the end of February 2012, there was still three Christmas trees from the previous Christmas and one from the year before. I can see this being a step up from some situations but not many. I rated the apartments two stars because it was bearable for the first two years of the three I lived there.",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>    <p>This article was generated by ChatGPT and is intended to serve as a tool for those seeking insights into the local property management company, Dargone USA. The summaries of user reviews within this article are designed to reflect a nuanced perspective on the company's performance and are based on past user experiences. It is not an endorsement or a critique of the company's services.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>The Good</h2>    <p>While it is challenging to find positive comments within the limited user reviews for Dargone USA, it can be acknowledged that some residents find initial satisfaction with the aesthetics of the property. The outward appearance and the promise of modern living spaces seem to initially attract residents. The properties also provide a stepping stone for those looking to move from less desirable living situations, which can be considered a positive aspect for certain individuals in urgent need of relocation.</p>    <p>Another mentionable aspect is the newness of some apartments, which suggests that some residents might have experienced a satisfactory living standard, at least during the initial phase of their tenancy. Furthermore, the company\u2019s property has been chosen by tenants as their home, which implies that it does meet the fundamental requirements for some residents, even if reviews suggest this satisfaction diminishes over time.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>The Great</h2>    <p>The reviews available do not provide specific instances of excellence in service or management that would warrant this section to detail any 'great' attributes. However, it's important to consider that reviews are often biased toward negative experiences, and satisfied customers may not be as compelled to leave reviews. Therefore, despite the absence of stellar testimonials in the user reviews, there may be untold instances where residents have had positive interactions or satisfactory tenures under Dargone USA's management.</p>    <p>It is possible that the staff or management team have resolved issues that went unmentioned or provided excellent service in ways not captured by the available reviews. As with any service industry, individual experiences can vary significantly, and renters might have had their expectations met in ways that they did not feel the need to share publicly.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>The Bad</h2>    <p>Unfortunately, a common theme among the user reviews of Dargone USA pertains to construction and design issues with the apartments. Renters have reported problems with thin walls resulting in a lack of privacy and disturbances from noise. Additionally, the review mentioning issues with plumbing and funny design flaws such as exposed pipes and poorly fitted cabinets suggests that quality was compromised. The building's structure apparently lacked sufficient insulation, amplifying the noise problem even further.</p>    <p>Another repeated complaint is associated with maintenance and management practices. Users have expressed dissatisfaction with the property\u2019s upkeep, noting unremoved snow and ice on stairs in the winter and a general messiness around the property. This suggests a neglect of routine maintenance tasks which can create both inconveniences and potential hazards for residents. Moreover, there seems to be a lack of enforcement of the property's rules, which contributes to ongoing concerns with neighbor behavior and cleanliness in the communal areas.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>The Ugly</h2>    <p>The ugliest aspects drawn from user reviews relate to the handling of security deposits and the general tenant experience towards the end of their lease. One reviewer felt that their significant effort to clean their apartment upon move-out was not acknowledged, with the return of only a small fraction of their deposit. Claims of unfair deposit deductions can severely tarnish a property management company's reputation, as it speaks directly to their integrity and fairness.</p>    <p>Moreover, the mention of a noticeable drop in the quality of new tenants, possibly due to managerial changes, and issues with unsupervised children and litter around the complex reflect poorly on the community environment and residential experience. Long-standing issues such as trash accumulation and neglected holiday decorations dating back over a year are indicative of a broader disregard for the resident's living experience. These factors contribute to a perception that the company does not prioritize the well-being or satisfaction of its tenants.</p>  </conclusion></article>"
