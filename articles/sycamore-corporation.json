When we did get in contact with the company, we were met with very unfriendly responses, almost giving us the feeling that we were an inconvenience to the employees. We were told that we would get the apartment we applied for and heard nothing back for two weeks. Then we received an email saying they had given it to someone else, wasting our time which could have been spent looking for other places. If you are looking for a competent, trusted property management company please look elsewhere.",

        "review": "Sycamore Square\n\nThe famous beautiful brick building on the corner of 12th and Harris in Fairhaven was built in 1890 and still charms tourists and visitors alike. Make sure to reserve a whole afternoon to spend at this unique indoor shopping community. \n\nStroll through Sycamore Square and find a wide variety of shops, restaurants, spa services, with 12th Street Shoes, Mambo and The Black Cat being among the most famous. What a  unique building to dine, browse and shop in Bellingham. Many professional offices round out this beautiful space. Big plus with plenty of parking (which is tough to find sometimes in Fairhaven) Sycamore Square owns the  parking lot on the corner of 13th and Harris.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In the realm of aesthetics and historical charm, Sycamore Corporation's properties, particularly the Sycamore Square building, receive praise. Patrons appreciate the opportunity to immerse themselves in history, citing the building as an exemplar of heritage preserved in the modern age. This unique indoor shopping community garnered positive responses for its array among shops, restaurants, and professional offices. Moreover, the convenience of ample parking\u2014a notable feature in a space like Fairhaven\u2014is frequently mentioned as a commendable aspect of the property.</p><p>Additionally, from the user reviews, customer experiences in the Sycamore Square are often described as pleasant outings. The beauty of the brick building and the variety it offers seem to delight visitors who recommend reserving time to explore the mix of retail and dining experiences. Such feedback underlines the corporation's ability to maintain an environment that enhances the local neighborhood and attracts positive attention.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Exceeeding expectations on the front of customer satisfaction, elements of Sycamore Corporation's service have been celebrated. Specific user reviews mention the \"creepy corner,\" which seemingly offers an intriguing, paranormal twist to Sycamore's charm. Customers acquainted with these features find them to be a unique and fun aspect of their experience, suggesting the company has a knack for creating memorable experiences that go beyond the norm of property management.</p><p>Further emphasizing the great, the customer service has been noted to engage with the community, providing personalized responses to complaints and reviews. When issues are raised, there is evidence of the company\u2019s attempt to address and resolve these concerns, showcasing a willingness to listen and improve. This responsiveness indicates that Sycamore takes its service seriously and strives to maintain a high standard of customer care.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite some positive feedback, Sycamore Corporation has not entirely escaped criticism in its property management practices. A common theme in user reviews is unprofessionalism; customers have reported instances where calls are not answered during business hours and voicemails are left without response. Additionally, some have felt that their interactions were less than friendly, creating an impression that inquiries and transactions were burdens on the staff. Such reports are damaging to the company's reputation for customer service.</p><p>Moreover, there have been references to miscommunications regarding tenancy applications, where promises of apartments were made and subsequently broken without timely notification. This has led to potential tenants experiencing frustration and inconvenience as they missed out on other housing opportunities. These activities reflect poorly on Sycamore Corporation's organizational efficiency and reliability.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The \"Ugly\" aspects of Sycamore Corporation revolve around the physical state of the properties and the contentious interactions with tenants. Reviews have highlighted issues like unkempt lawns and inadequately maintained parking lot striping, suggesting a lack of attention to property maintenance. Furthermore, some user reviews suggest an excessive rent price that does not align with the quality of the environment provided, a serious concern for current and prospective residents.</p><p>In some of the less favorable user reviews, a tenant described experiencing significant delays in repair work, particularly for a glass door damaged during landscaping. The response which the company provided implied that the tenant\u2019s review was petty, a clash that denotes tension between the company\u2019s perspectives on feedback and customer expression. This is indicative of a particularly strained tenant-management relationship that overshadows the more positive aspects of the Sycamore Corporation's operations.</p></section>"
