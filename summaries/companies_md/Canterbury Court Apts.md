The timely completion of maintenance and an overall professional demeanor from the staff contribute to residents' satisfaction, offering an insight into the daily experiences of those happy to call Canterbury Court Apts home.

## Great

There are aspects of Canterbury Court Apts that have particularly stood out as exceptional. Some tenants have experienced exceptional customer service, with one review highlighting a property manager's support in facilitating a move from out of state. This points to a level of service that goes beyond basic duties, providing genuine help during what can be a highly stressful life event. Additionally, the property manager’s respect for current social responsibilities, as seen during the year 2020, resonates with tenants who value community well-being.

Other reviews focus on the exceptional community experience, describing their living environment as very quiet with great neighbors, solidifying Canterbury Court Apts as more than just a place to live, but a place to enjoy peace and cultivate relationships. Compliments towards maintenance staff also feature heavily in user reviews, with words such as "quickly and effectively" coming up, which is pivotal for tenant contentment as it assures them that their comfort and concerns are a top priority.

## Bad

However, not every experience shared in user reviews paints Canterbury Court Apts in a favorable light. There are concerns over high utility bills linked to inadequate insulation, with reports of window condensation, mold, and extremes in temperature regulation. These might indicate neglect in addressing fundamental infrastructure issues. The limitations on using personal appliances like window AC units further compound the discomfort during warmer seasons, posing significant drawbacks for the residents.

Another issue raised involves the noise levels, particularly for those living in lower units. Hearing all manners of sounds from neighbors, including toilets flushing, could imply poor soundproofing between apartments. This level of noise pollution can severely disrupt the peace and quiet that a home should ideally provide, leading to frustration and sleep disturbances for affected residents.

## Ugly

The "ugly" truth, as reported by some tenants of Canterbury Court Apts, deals predominantly with security deposit disputes and lack of post-tenancy transparency. Some reviews detail unpleasant experiences whereby entire security deposits are withheld for reasons such as carpet replacement due to alleged pet damage. Accusations of using unreliable methods to prove damages and refusal to conduct walk-throughs upon move-out have painted a picture of a company that may be unfairly charging its tenants.

Additionally, reports suggest that after moving out, past residents face demands for additional payments on top of what was already forfeited from their security deposits. Lack of evidence provided for such claims and a sense of being unjustly targeted could be indicative of potential mishandling when it comes to tenant deposit returns. This not only strains the tenant-company relationship but may also tarnish the company’s reputation in the long term.

In conclusion, while there are both satisfactory and unfavorable reviews of Canterbury Court Apts, this article's intent is to present a balanced view from the existing user reviews. Prospective tenants should weigh these aspects carefully and further investigate to make an informed decision. It’s crucial to note that these are past experiences and may not necessarily reflect the current status or future experiences at Canterbury Court Apts.
