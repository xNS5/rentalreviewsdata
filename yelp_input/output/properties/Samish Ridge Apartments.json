      "review": "If you're going to live in Bellingham, live at Samish Ridge. I cannot say enough good things about it.\n\nWe lived here for four years and they were wonderful. First off, the location is awesome. It's close to Haggen, Fred Meyer, Rite Aid, El Agave, Boomer's, and it's right next to the Park N Ride so it is beyond easy (and a short bus ride) to everywhere on Bill McDonald Pkwy and the WWU campus. We rarely used our car because Bellingham public transit is so great and Samish Ridge is right next to the Park N Ride.\n\nThe apartments themselves are clean and spacious. There is a fitness room that I used countless times, the area is beautiful for going on walks, and the manager is wonderful. Her name is Melanie, and she is incredibly kind and personable and responds to maintenance requests and questions very fast. \n\nThe complex is quiet - not a party zone for students like Indian St., and the rent is fair. Pets allowed AND washer/dryer in unit. Again, I can't say enough good things. The staff, the location, the apartments themselves - everything was superb. We loved living here and were sad to move out of the area.",

      "review": "I previously lived here for about 2.5 years. I have lived several places since but this is absolutely the best apartment complex I have lived in to date. \n\nThe first thing is the management. Leann and Kari are awesome, awesome managers. Nice and friendly and respond to maintenance requests in record time. I never realized just how spoiled I was until I moved away.\n\nLocation, location, location. Super quiet complex away from the main campus student rentals. I lived here when I was attending WWU and it was great because it was literally a five minute walk to the park and ride. After I was out of school it was nice because it was super easy to get on the freeway to go to work - 1 minute drive to go north on I-5, less than 5 minutes to go south.\n\nThe apartments themselves are spacious and a great value for the price. I lived in both a two bedroom and a one bedroom and they were both huge! The one bedroom had the largest closet I have ever seen in an apartment, ever. The cabinets/carpet/flooring are all standard apartment fare, nothing special but really well maintained. Washer, dryer, dishwasher included. There's an exercise room in the main building and you can reserve common area in the main building for events.",

      "review": "Samish Ridge is hands down the best apartment complex I've ever lived at and by far the best in Bellingham! Leann and Kari are the greatest. Unfortunately we graduated and my fiance was offered a job opportunity back at home so we moved. We have had a hard time finding a place down at home that compares. This complex was pet friendly, the apartments are very clean, well maintained, spacious and affordable. The staff is beyond great, they're always available to talk to, the property grounds are well kept, quiet, and safe. We never once had an issue with our place and the only time we had a small maintenance request, it was handled within the hour. We also miss their workout area and club house. They have pool table, bowflex, three cardio machines and a sauna. Rarely did it ever get busy enough to wait for anything either.\n\nThe location is great, it's not too far from the University and in a great neighborhood where you're close enough to the city, but partying and noise had never been an issue. The complex is comprised of a pretty even mix of students and  working professionals. You're just about a 10 minute walk to Fred Meyer or to Haggen and the park 'n ride is right across the street, so you have plenty of options. This place is rarely vacant, as we were on a waiting list and referred by some friends before first living here. So take a look and if they have a vacancy, take it! You'll thank me later! :)",
