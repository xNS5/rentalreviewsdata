When we did get in contact with the company, we were met with very unfriendly responses, almost giving us the feeling that we were an inconvenience to the employees. We were told that we would get the apartment we applied for and heard nothing back for two weeks. Then we received an email saying they had given it to someone else, wasting our time which could have been spent looking for other places. If you are looking for a competent, trusted property management company please look elsewhere.",

        "review": "Sycamore Square\n\nThe famous beautiful brick building on the corner of 12th and Harris in Fairhaven was built in 1890 and still charms tourists and visitors alike. Make sure to reserve a whole afternoon to spend at this unique indoor shopping community. \n\nStroll through Sycamore Square and find a wide variety of shops, restaurants, spa services, with 12th Street Shoes, Mambo and The Black Cat being among the most famous. What a  unique building to dine, browse and shop in Bellingham. Many professional offices round out this beautiful space. Big plus with plenty of parking (which is tough to find sometimes in Fairhaven) Sycamore Square owns the  parking lot on the corner of 13th and Harris.",
