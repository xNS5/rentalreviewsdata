      "review": "I'd give zero if I could. The mgmt staff here is very unprofessional and do things that should get them fired, from screaming at tenants to keeping the fitness room closed while health department isn't requiring it. They selectively enforce rules ( I see dogs off leash all the time, I went out after waking up to let my dog go to the bathroom for 3 minutes, not a walk, and the old lady screamed at me from across the street, then sent a notice to comply or vacate threat which is supposed to come after 3 warnings). I hate moving but may consider leaving after the 1st year just because of the office staff. Maintenance is nice and on their tasks, A+ for them. Parking is a nightmare. The units to the right of the complex (which I reside in) are old and not well kept, but come with a higher price (although lower than new construction). The unit was dirty when I moved in and had to deep clean it myself, even though they will charge me a cleaning fee when I move and not clean the apt again. Pretty slummy actions on just the mgmt staffs end Location is great, could be a nice complex with competent mgmt.",

      "review": "Lived here 5 years, always paid the rent and bills on time,  never asked the management for anything except once to repair the broken washing machine...the washer - dryer unit finally got replaced with an older one after more than a month with no washer-dryer.. Didn't complain and just used it when I finally got it. I have been a homeowner and a landlord myself ... I cleaned the place conscientiously and thoroughly when I moved out, did not damage anything, including the walls, but still got charged a $125 cleaning and painting fee. (in addition to the deep carpet cleaning fee which was an expected cost).  When asked to explain the cleaning fee, the current manager was rude, disrespectful and nitpicking. In retrospect I should not have even bothered to take such time and care cleaning the unit before I left, since there was no appreciation expressed and they only look for ways to keep your money however they can. Not impressed. Bad management and interpersonal skills. My car was broken into, parked in front of my unit, and things were stolen... after reporting it to the management, they agreed to notify the other tenants, but they did nothing. \nDon't expect to get back your security deposit and don't expect to be treated in a courteous or professional manner if you ever have to ask the management about anything at this complex. So glad to have moved out and bought my own place now. I hope the manager learns some management skills and how to be courteous with people. And lesson learned: don't bother cleaning the unit when you move out because you won't get your rightful security deposit back, anyway.",

      "review": "Not sure what all the bad reviews are about. I've lived here for just about 9 months so I haven't gone through a lease renewal but so far this place has been awesome. Management has been great and super friendly and helped out with any issues or questions I've had in a timely manner. Maintenance requests have always been taken care of either same day or the next day as long as it's not on a weekend (I imagine they would tend to urgent issues on the weekend too). The maintenance guy is super friendly and always cracking jokes and says hello anytime you pass him by.\nI really love the apartment because there's hardly any freeway noise, the unit and deck are both very spacious, the place has a nice view, it's a very central location to Bellingham, parking has never been an issue and its affordable for Bellingham prices. Of course issues can arise when either ending a lease or renewing so I'll update if that's the case but I really don't imagine having any issues considering how great it's been so far.",

      "review": "Management is the worst here that I have ever seen. They do not care about anybody except themselves, they close down the office whenever without telling anybody, they send back your packages without warning you, and they do not care for your safety or wellbeing. During my time living at Village, they tried to increase my rent mid-lease and when I asked them about it they refused to fix the lease, reduce my rent, told me I was wrong and that if I don't pay it that I'll be late on rent and will have to pay added fees. Told management I knew my legal rights and they better fix this, so they agreed to look into it and get back to me. They never got back to me and forced me to hunt them down, again, and when I finally got ahold of somebody they told me they were wrong and it was illegal for them to try to do that. They also took over 2 weeks to fix my washing machine, same deal with my dryer when it broke, they try to charge you for others not following the rules, but when you go to report issues (such as being harassed by neighbors because they're drunk and disorderly) management refuses to do anything about it. This management is the sleaziest, sketchiest, careless bunch of people I have ever met. Rent at your own risk, do not recommend it here.",

The management office was totally disorganized and their staff was always changing.  The staff never was able to give you a straight answer on anything.  When I finally moved out, they never sent me my deposit even though they sent mE a letter indicating that they would.  They refused to talk with me after telling me the check totaling hundreds of dollars was sent, but NEVER ARRIVED!!!!  DON'T BE FOOLED!!!",

This caused some problems because no help was received during the whole process. When I went to to the office to sign for the lease the manager YELLED at me and the current tenant \"You have been a waste of my time\"... Now that I am the tenant nothing but horrible manners and service from the manager.\n\nThe apartments are new and nice but the management is so bad I recommend others to reconsider and look for other places because they can ruin your experience living there.",

  "summary": "# Village At Baker Creek: A Balanced Look at Resident Experiences\n\nThis article synthesizes user reviews to provide a balanced perspective on Village At Baker Creek. Note that these reviews are generated by ChatGPT and are only a tool to aid in finding a property management company or rental property.\n\n## Good\n\nSome residents of Village At Baker Creek have had positive experiences, noting the location as a key advantage. They found the proximity to shops and necessary amenities appealing. Furthermore, certain individuals reported satisfaction with maintenance service, with requests often handled the same or next day, barring weekends. Maintenance staff have been described as friendly, approachable, and effective in addressing issues promptly.\n\nIn addition to good maintenance service, there are accounts praising the site's upkeep and timely assistance from the management team. For residents who did not encounter significant dilemmas throughout their stay, the living experience was deemed 'awesome' with apartments being tagged as spacious and affordable, considering the local market rates. Residents here enjoyed a comfortable and convenient environment that aligned with their expectations for apartment living.\n\n## Great\n\nSome reviews highlighted the complex's excellent location near malls and various shopping centers, contributing to its appeal. Also appreciated is the management's assistance with administrative processes such as lease takeovers, which can be a daunting task for tenants. These gestures by the staff, even if inconsistent, did not go unnoticed.\n\nMoreover, a few residents described Village At Baker Creek as a \"really nice place to live,\" commending the neighborhood and how well-maintained the site is. Comments touched upon the efforts put into the property's aesthetic and functional upkeep, which can contribute significantly to the quality of life and overall satisfaction of tenants. Delicious meals from nearby dining options further added to the charm and convenience of the locale for some.\n\n## Bad\n\nUnfortunately, not all feedback has been favorable. There have been numerous reports of unprofessional behavior from the management staff, from selective rule enforcement to lack of concern for residents' safety and wellbeing. Some residents experienced frustration due to the management's inconsistent communication and handling of maintenance requests, which supposedly took longer than reasonable to resolve.\n\nIn several user reviews, there is a sentiment that the level of professionalism and customer service provided by the property management did not meet standard expectations. Residents described encountering rudeness, disrespect, and dismissiveness when approaching the management for issues, leading to an unpleasant living environment for some. The management's behavior, to some reviewers, indicated a lack of appreciation and disrespect for the residents, adversely impacting their living experience.\n\n## Ugly\n\nThe experiences that can be characterized as 'ugly' involved severe grievances, such as rent increase attempts during existing lease terms and unwarranted neglect in handling security deposits. Some residents experienced personal property theft and found management's indifference and to be alarming. Furthermore, unfulfilled promises and accusations of the management's disregard for tenant rights only added to the distress faced by these residents.\n\nTo compound the difficulties, some tenants reported poor conditions upon move-in, discovering unclean and poorly maintained units that demanded immediate attention. Despite efforts to resolve such issues amicably, the management's lack of responsiveness led to feelings of deceit and exploitation among some tenants. Complaints of frequent staff turnover and mismanagement of documents portray a property management situation that, at its worst, can be seen as chaotic and untrustworthy.\n\nIn sum, while Village At Baker Creek offers some positives like location and a potentially pleasant living space maintained by hardworking staff, the bad and ugly aspects of management practices and tenant relations significantly taint the living experience. Future prospects should weigh these factors carefully when considering this property. Remember, this article's intent is to provide insight into the varying experiences of past and present tenants, fostering a better understanding of what to expect from Village At Baker Creek."
