        "review": "The staff is great, and the building I lived in (the Leopold building) was wonderful. Jena Curry and the rest managing the Leopold apartments were excellent. They were really quick to respond to whatever issues I had, and were happy to help me figure out some of the more (at first irritating, later charming) features of my room. The Leopold is an old building with a lot of original fixtures, and they preserved as much as they could - if you're willing to trade a bit of modern convenience for some antique charm, then you should rent with these guys. A last note, having just finished an early lease break; I had to move quickly due to family, and the Daylight staff were really quick to help me find a new tenant, get the proper forms filed early, and make my move happen with very little difficulty. I cannot recommend them highly enough",

The building was safe and secure and clean. The neighbors were cool. The staff were friendly and easy to work with, and the rent was more than fair. When I wanted to upgrade they worked with me to find something in my price range within their other properties and though I didn't end up changing units, I appreciated their effort. I will miss my cute little apartment. It was a very special place. I would have stayed there forever if I didn't buy a house.",

Prices were fair and staff were friendly, I was given prompt communication about inspections/constructions and had all my needs met. Move out procedures were straight forward and after following them to a T I received my whole deposit back. Would definitely rent from again.",

We do not supply carts at any of our buildings for numerous reasons. We do encourage our Tenants to purchase their own form of cart to haul in groceries and other items into the building. It just so happens the Leopold Building where you reside is also occupied by the Hotel Leo. The Hotel Leo owns and manages their own carts for guests of the hotel. Daylight Properties does not own these carts.  \n\nPlease feel free to contact our office directly with any issues you may have as a resident of our Leopold Apartments. We want your residency to be a positive experience."

I lived in the Daylight building and though the building is old it is well maintained and cleaning is done daily M-F. Maintenance is quick to respond to requests and extremely nice. The Daylight Properties administration staff are a pleasure to deal with. Jena in the front office is professional and caring and has everyone's best interest in mind.",

        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "In the event of an emergency when time does not allow for 48 hours written notice, we do have the right to enter a unit as per our lease terms.  In this case, there was determined to be a leak coming from the newly installed fire suppressant system in one of the units and it was necessary to enter more than one unit to determine the source of the leak.\n\nIn cases when there is insufficient time to provide 48 hours written notice, we always attempt to contact the Tenant by phone to let them know what is going on. \n\nOur buildings are inspected annually to be sure they meet code standards.  This in turn led to the installation of a new fire suppressant system in 2015.  This process may have caused a temporary inconvenience to the residents, but the increased safety to our Tenants is more important."

I wanted my bedroom door changed, I wanted some of the paint colors in my living room and kitchen swapped, and I wanted my refrigerator door mounted to open on the opposite side.  Some of these seemed kind of minor and made me feel like I was just being picky.  So, honestly, I really wasn't sure what to expect or if this would be taken seriously.  Boy was I surprised.  Jena, the Leasing Manager, immediately noted my requests and made me feel like they were well received.  Then she had a maintenance technician, Keith, contact me the very next business day!  Keith met with me within 48 hours of that!  He was great.  We walked through my apartment, looked at all of my requests, and came up with a plan to address all of them.  Every single one!!!  He was so easy to work with and was very personable and responsive to everything I had listed.  He didn't, for a single minute, make me feel like I was just being picky, even though I had thought I was.  The whole experience was incredible and now I am living in a place that I've been able to make my own, with their help.  It's really encouraging knowing what a great team there is supporting me.  If I could give them more than 5 Stars, I would.",

I responded to an ad on Craigslist for office space.  \"Hannah\", who apparently is in charge of showings, indicated that she had a 10:45am slot available for showing it to me.  I then called back and got her voicemail, confirming I would be there at the appointed time.  She then called me back to say \"Sorry, that time slot is taken and I don't have time until next week.\"  What?  Due to the fact that this was a small space, perfect for my needs and she was throwing up roadblocks to showing it to me and wouldn't lease it to me without showing it to me...but had no time to show it (a vicious, circular loop of highly unachievable conditions), I offered to give her a deposit right there and then.  But, that was refused.  She said she would show it to me this morning if it was still available, but that it \"would probably be leased by then.\"  I then called one of the principals, he listened, but then told me to call \"Hannah\" again.  Right! A big \"No Thanks!\" on that one!  So, this morning, she calls me to say she can show it to me, but she has a \"lease pending.\"  Pathetic!  If you want a run around and totally \"un-customer centric\" treatment, Daylight Properties is your place!",

It aims to provide a balanced overview of the company's performance in property management based on user reviews. This article's intent is to be informative and assist those seeking a property management company or rental property. It is not an endorsement or a critique of the company's services.</p>  </section>  <section class=\"good\">    <heading><h2>Good</h2></heading>    <p>Daylight Properties shines in the eyes of several reviewers when it comes to maintaining the charm and integrity of historic buildings while providing modern amenities. There's a clear sense of satisfaction among tenants who appreciate the blend of antique charm and the company's effort to cater to a diverse range of residential and commercial properties. Users have praised Daylight Properties for their fair prices, efficient communication, and for being compassionate and proactive landlords.</p>    <p>Especially noteworthy are mentions of the company's quick responsiveness to the needs of its tenants. From simple help requests to assistance in more complex situations like an early lease termination, the company has been lauded for its flexible and swift action. The personal touch in service is further evidenced by the company having taken the time to respond to several reviews, actively engaging with customer feedback, and demonstrating an appreciation for their clients.</p>  </section>  <section class=\"great\">    <heading><h2>Great</h2></heading>    <pag(content)><p>In certain instances, Daylight Properties has significantly exceeded expectations, offering an exemplar standard of care and attention. Their commitment to restoring historic buildings has not only provided unique living and working spaces but also contributed positively to the community. The presence of friendly and easy-to-work-with staff adds to the allure of Daylight Properties, providing a human touch to the property management experience that is often missing in larger companies.</p>    <p>Moreover, their ability to handle maintenance issues swiftly and their provision of a secure and clean environment have garnered high praise. User reviews frequently mention that the company's admin tools, tenant portal, and communication systems are user-friendly and efficient, making the routine aspects of renting more convenient for tenants. This customer-centric approach, combined with a genuine concern for tenant satisfaction, has left a strong impression, highlighting Daylight Properties' dedication to service quality.</p>  </section>  <section class=\"bad\">    <heading><h2>Bad</h2></heading>    <p>Not all user reviews for Daylight Properties are glowing, and some tenants have faced challenges that negatively impacted their experience. Issues such as perceived rudeness from the staff and misunderstandings related to property facilities have been sources of frustration for some. One particular sore point for a tenant was a lack of moving carts in a building, which evidently created a challenge for older residents. The response to this issue, however, seemed to suggest a disconnect between the facility provisions and tenant expectations.</p>    <p>Another point of contention for some clients has been the handling of financial transactions. For instance, a user review criticized the company's policy on automatic withdrawals, labeling it as inflexible and unfair. This points to a need for clearer communication and perhaps a review of financial policies to ensure that tenants feel their concerns are properly considered and addressed.</p>  )  <section class=\"ugly\">    <heading><h2>Ugly</h2></heading>    <p>In the realm of the truly disappointing, some reviews touch upon serious grievances that could tarnish the reputation of Daylight Properties. A few alarming complaints arose concerning the violation of privacy and inadequate adherence to state laws regarding property entrance notices. An instance where a tenant's unit was entered without the legally required 48 hours notice was particularly distressing, despite the company's claim of an emergency situation. This suggests an urgent need for Daylight Properties to review their internal policies and ensure strict compliance with legal standards to maintain trust and safety.</p>    <p>Furthermore, one potential tenant reported an extremely negative interaction with the company's leasing process, citing poor communication and an overall perception of a lack of customer focus. The frustration was compounded by an alleged runaround and unavailability for viewing appointments, leading to a loss of trust before a business relationship could even begin. Such episodes highlight the critical importance of transparency and customer service in the property management industry.</p>  </section></article>"
