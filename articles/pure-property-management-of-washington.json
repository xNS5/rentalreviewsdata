The New Property Manager Celese Thompson made the process very simple for me as I moved out of state and all the things that involves with closing a lease and being co-tenants.  She was so communicative and helpful offering valuable solutions. Highly recommend them and especially Celese.",

So because I live next door to the property that you manage you dont feel like you have no responsibility to respond to my many phone calls and emails? I have heard nothing. I dont know what the homeowners response was to my request. Horrible customer service!",

This is an absolutely horrible and down right disgusting rental company dont waste your time going through them and dont expect your deposit back soo if you do rent through them just leave the place trashed when you leave. When we moved out of the resident we were ever paying in rent the house should be condemned and we actually left it cleaner than when we moved in and they have the audacity to send me a $100 check out of the $2500 deposit I had to put down to move in to the run down brick house from the 40s that is literally falling apart.

It took me resorting to outrage to get a response that took twelve days and has yet to solve any issues.  This company is not worth losing your money to, absolutely embarrassing that they call themselves professional but cant even rent a secure unit out.",

It has been over a month and I still haven't received my security deposit and the property is already listed for sale. I've been calling, left messages and no call back to explain what is going on. I visited the office everyday and it's always locked and has a sign saying all managers are in the field. Why would they have an office if they are always on the field, makes no sense. It's very unprofessional that the company does not return my calls or emails to explain what is going on. I've rented from different management companies and I've always gotten my security deposit within a month from the move out date. I am very disappointed with this management company.",

Communication is incredibly slow and poor, they charge a rental package thats supposed to include setting up your utilities but we still had to call the gas company to setup our own gas and then dealt with scary gas and carbon monoxide leaks in the unit due to an ancient valve that shouldnt have even been there and then when replaced wasnt even tightened properly. I could go on and on but honestly Id run the other direction if I saw they were the property managers for any future rentals, will never do business with them again.",

They also will force you to participate in several rental programs such as a furnace filter delivery services and others at a monthly expense to you on top of rent. Fair warning if you have pets you will be required to register them through one of their many 3rd party apps you are required to use at a cost to you upon every lease renewal date. You will also be subject to home inspections every 6 months. You will be given a time and date which is non negotiable because there schedule is just so busy.

This property management found a legal loop hole to displace my single mom and her 3 kids during the pandemic, stating in a letter that they intend to move into the property themselves within 60 days. Prior to this during their lease, they contacted the management about a septic problem with the house. The management did not send someone out to check the issue and continued to be unresponsive. During the wait our family was able to check the states public records that proved that their property's septic tank had yet to be cleaned for the past 10 years despite the legal requirement. Since this timely septic issue affected every toilet in the house and wasnt resolved, they hired a personal handyman to clean the tank and communicated so. The property management was then responsive, asking for reimbursment for not only \"tampering\" with the septic tank, but for \"tampons\" that apparently clogged the tank despite never actually investigating the issue. After moving, the management continues to contact the family about owing money for the carpet, despite already paying the usual carpet cleaning fee. They are putting a single mother in dept. DO NOT lease with this management.",

We were following the WA State moratorium rules and our clients direction.\nWe do welcome the leaseholder to contact us directly about any questions they may have had during their tenancy.\nThank you."

Then the lease had fee upon fee which most just said \"going rate\" so to rekey 1 door cost 97 dollars I soon found out... 45 dollar benefits package that is no benefit just more money in their pockets. Also they do follow guidelines and laws sure, upped our rent 800dollars as soon as they could after covid restrictions were lifted, there's no limit on raising amounts in wa state and clearly they enjoy that law!! When I spoke to the owner about the lease and all these new things I didn't sign up for with remax she gave me the run around and when I moved out we paid all of the fees.. But I know of same discussions with other tenants where their lease got changed and those fees would not apply so not sure what made them special... I understand their are bad tenants and landlords get ripped off at times but it's really sad when good tenants then have to pay for it..",

I chose today at 1:30pm\n\nI just received an email saying I was confirmed for another date and time that is 3 days beyond what I chose. The email didnt reference our appointment today.\n\nThere seems to be a lapse in communication and a lack of desire to make good on situations with prospective tenants.\n\nVery disappointed with the lack of ownership and responsibility of this company.\n\nIntegrity and honesty are my core values so when something isnt aligned with that, the universe does its job and spins people and companies out of my orbit. This seems to be one of those times.\n\nMay this review be helpful for those who need to see it.

My brother has been trying to talk to them since last week and they haven't answered yet. That's why I dared to write here because I don't know what to do anymore, I'm desperate. The truth is, I'm not one of the people who writes comments. But I'm tired of being charged for things when they don't even answer you to give you an explanation.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Based on user reviews, PURE Property Management of Washington seems to have had positive interactions with some of its clients, especially in the areas of communication and responsiveness to maintenance requests. For instance, a user appreciated the simple and well-executed move-in procedure and later received effective assistance in managing a lease closure from out of state, signifying the company's willingness to provide solutions to unique tenant situations. Additionally, the prompt and courteous handling of repairs and attention to detail in the application and move-in processes were highlighted as positive experiences, exemplifying the caring approach of the management.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>The property management company seems to exceed expectations in terms of their professionalism and quality of services offered to clients. Tenants have praised the management for speedy resolutions to maintenance issues, noting that concerns are often addressed the next day. The process for potential tenants and communication with contractors and vendors is described as easy and certainly standing out compared to average companies. It is also worth mentioning that several reviewers found Leading Edge's staff members, particularly identifiable professionals, to be noteworthy for their exceptional service.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, the company has not been without its shortcomings. Users have reported instances of poor customer service, specifically mentioning the failure to respond to multiple communications regarding concerns such as tree issues. Additionally, there are reports of misrepresented property features and inadequate unit security. Tenants have complained about outdated facilities, unresolved issues even after repeated communication, and frustration over what appears to be management's disregard for the comfort and safety of their clients.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><palleged mistreatment seems to have created an unpleasant experience for some tenants, with accusations of the management using legal loopholes to displace tenants during the pandemic and unresponsiveness to urgent property issues. There are reports of major disappointments in how security deposits are handled, with tenants feeling that the return of their deposits was unjust and the company's actions being perceived as dishonest. Furthermore, user reviews suggest a pattern of excessive and sudden rent increases, as well as the imposition of non-negotiable fees and services, contributing to the negative perception of the company.</p></section>",
