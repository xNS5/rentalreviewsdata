        "review": "Renters Beware!!!!!   When we viewed the apartment it was still occupied. We had Melanie, property manager, sign a contract stating it would be clean when we moved in. This place stinks soooooo bad still! I go to work smelling like a cat box and bad B.O. When we asked for repairs they immediately served us with a Quit of Tenancy and forced us to move out three weeks after we moved in. To top it off, three days after we moved in we we're drinking coffee \"enjoying\" our \"new\" stinky apartment and Mimi, the owner, comes barging through the back door. She pulled the trim that the \"security\" chain was attached to off the wall. Don't make the same mistake we did, keep looking. There's a reason why it's month to month here. And it's no good reason...",

        "review": "We recently had brooks take over our apartment complex, horrible company. They have lost multiple checks, then made it our problem to track down the check numbers and prove to them that we payed them for rent. They also do not take care of the property, everything is now overgrown, the parking lot is filled with leaves and other debris, and they have sent nobody to tend to the property.\n\nI would highly recommend avoiding this company if you can. They obviously do no care about their properties or tennants, and are poorly managed. We will be moving out at the end of our lease.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>It's challenging to find positive feedback for Brooks Property Management, but some user reviews suggest that there is at least one mention of professionalism. A user pointed out their impression of the company being very professional during interactions. This is an encouraging sign that, at least in some aspects, the management team endeavors to maintain a certain standard of service that might be worth recognizing.</p><p>Another review from a user provided a rating of four stars, which indicates that there may be instances of satisfactory service. While specific details were not provided, such ratings suggest that not all experiences with Brooks Property Management have been negative. This highlights the possibility that certain properties or staff members may perform better than the overall average suggests.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Unfortunately, there was a lack of outstanding user reviews that could shine a light on particularly great aspects of Brooks Property Management. Most reviews either expressed dissatisfaction or had minimal commentary. While there are isolated mentions of professionalism or decent experiences, they do not constitute a strong consensus indicating exceptional service or positively transformative experiences.</p><p>This article's intent is to address the general sentiment of users rather than highlight any purely great experiences, making it difficult to compile stories of satisfaction on a broader level. As a result, the emphasis remains on the service failures and disappointments noted by various tenants.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>User reviews highlight critical issues with Brooks Property Management, notably related to maintenance and property condition. One user detailed a disheartening experience when they moved into a filthy apartment, despite a written agreement to have it cleaned before occupancy. Their request for repairs led to retaliation, as they were handed a notice to vacate shortly after moving in, which is a serious concern regarding tenant rights and safe living conditions.</p><p>Additionally, multiple tenants expressed frustration over the company's handling of their rent payments. Numerous reviews indicate that rent checks often go missing, with management shifting the burden to tenants to prove payment. This not only creates distrust between the company and its tenants but leads to potentially serious repercussions, like threats of eviction, compounding user dissatisfaction overall.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most alarming reviews concerning Brooks Property Management reveal patterns of severe mismanagement and unprofessional conduct. For instance, a user reported that management did not show up for a scheduled property viewing, resulting in wasted time for prospective tenants. Such negligence can severely impact a tenant's trust and confidence in the company.</p><p>Moreover, user frustration reached a peak with comments about the unkempt condition of properties, including overgrown landscaping and unaddressed debris. These complaints suggest a lack of fundamental upkeep in properties managed by Brooks, illustrating a broader trend of neglect that could indicate underlying systemic issues within the company. Overall, these negative experiences reflect poorly on their reputation and raise serious concerns for potential renters.</p></section>"
