        "review": "THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! DO NOT MOVE HERE I BEG YOU!\nThis place is an absolute nightmare, and was before we moved in, and continues to be.\nI couldn't scratch the surface of how bad this place was, but to give you context it was about $800 a month per person, and we lived there for about a year.\n\n-AWFUL communication from the multiple people who owned the property (I think there were 3 companies that owned in in less than a year). The emergency line (on multiple occasions) went unanswered, they just really don't care.\n\n-The apartments themselves SUCK. Not only are they small, but the design makes no sense. We had no living room/living space, and had no openable windows in the main area.\n\n-There is no upkeep to the property. This place is the definition of \"don't fix it, paint over it\". In the winter, there was a broken waterpipe that made accessing the parking lot dangerous -they didn't fix it for weeks.\n\n-No one who works there has any clue what they're doing (expect for Carl and Niko, who are awesome). Probably due to the management constantly changing, no one is ever able to give you a straight answer on anything -that is if you can even reach them. You call, you email, you can visit the office. Most of the time, they will not answer your calls (even if you leave a message), and are almost never at the office during office hours.\n\n-My roommates and I were tricked and lied to when it came to our lease. When we signed the lease, we were signing a lease for 5 bedrooms. AFTER we signed the lease, they told us no 5 bedroom apartments were available, so we ended up having to split up. We were totally tricked/trapped.\n\n-The security deposit was $200. After emailing and calling SEVERAL people, I finally got my deposit back about a month after moving out. When I got it, they had taken out $85 for maintenance and cleaning. WHAT?? Not only was the apartment FILTHY when we arrived, we also deep cleaned it before leaving. There was absolutely no damage, so there is no reason that money should've been taken out.\n\n-For weeks in the Winter, and Spring the fire alarms would go off for minutes at a time. Everyone would have to pack up themselves and their pets to move out into the parking -only for the fire department to tell us that there was no fire, but faulty equipment. THIS HAPPENED PROBABLY 10 TIMES ALTOGETHER.\n\n-Consistently bad wifi, no place to set up cable or internet in the main area\n\n-No circulation (food goes bad pretty fast)\n\n-Laundry cost $4 a load. The machines are disgusting and never get cleaned, same with the dryers that usually don't dry your stuff properly. It's ridiculous we have to pay at all.\n\n-Of course, rent is expensive everywhere, but to have the audacity to charge so much money for such an HORRENDOUS place to live is criminal.\n\nPlease don't move here, I promise you'll regret it.",

        "review": "The PTLA Property Management company bought this property took over it as of YESTERDAY and I'm already upset. They gave notice yesterday in the EVENING on a FRIDAY about a bunch of things changing, didn't answer 8+ voice calls or messages even though their office claimed to still be open for multiple hours. Now they're out the entire weekend and ALSO THE MONDAY cause it's a holiday, and they have changed due date for rent to TUESDAY! So essentially they have made it impossible to contact them about these issues and any questions at all.\n\nAnd reading other reviews for PTLA it is highly obvious they never answer phone calls, and they have yet to provide a single email address that will actually reply. HORRIFIC customer service, especially for a new property they've taken on.\n\nViking Gardens is about to go downhill fast.",

        "review": "I have never been more disrespected by a company In my life and when I was messed up by snow-closures making it impossible for me to raise enough money from my closed job for my rent the process of working with eviction prevention services didnt go cohesively at all and ended in them charging me massive late fees in utter disregard to the agreement paperwork they signed and causing me extreme disgust. The staff here is extremely unable to communicate in reasonable ways regarding money. This keeps me from giving this living space a good review.",

        "review": "I didn't have functional internet for the first 6 months I lived there. I complained relentlessly, went into the office frequently and didn't receive help until the pandemic, when I was sassed by a staff member for requesting internet during the pandemic. My only response was \"uhh I'm working from home now so yeah, I really need internet.\" Their staff has the combined intelligence of a fence post. They should probably investigate the office for a leak of some sort, you go in there and it's like they've been huffing fumes. Overpriced, cheap construction (expect to hear your roommates talk through the walls) and absolute worst treatment I've ever had by any land management company. I truly hope this business goes under for the greater good of renters. Pick anything else. Please",

        "review": "I've lived here for over 2 years, its a good location and decent apartment. The price is a little high but not terrible. The worst thing is they recently changed the internet, so there is no wired connection anymore, they just decided to disable the connections in the walls so they no longer work. There is only shotty WiFi instead. So now they are charging me higher rent for the same apartment and worse internet. I talked to the staff and they said they have no plans to improve the internet situation.\n\nUpdate (drop to 1 star): WiFi is getting worse, cuts out every hour, everyone in my apartment has tried talking to management but they refuse to fix the situation.",
