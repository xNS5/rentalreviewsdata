        "review": "These apartments get the job done, and while you aren't getting high quality, the prices are good for this area. When I moved into my unit last year, my unit contained fleas, which the property management company appeared to have known about. While the situation was handled promptly, it was an unpleasant experience for me, and irresponsible on their part to not inform me. Additionally, the carpets in my unit were absolutely atrocious looking, with numerous stains. The laundry machines are coin operated and do not work well, requiring several drying cycles before your clothes will actually dry. Some pros of this unit are that the one bedrooms pretty good in size, with it's best features probably being the balconey and it's convinient location to WWU. It's located right in front of a bus lines that goes up to WWU, and it's a month to month lease after six months. As a graduate student in a budget, I felt that these apartments served their purpose well. However, I would advise renters to just be aware of some of the issues I mentioned above too.",

        "review": "I love the community and area. This complex has ruined the experience Bellingham had to offer due to the unprofessional staff who chose to not abide by the RCW codes they so rudely told me to \"look up.\" On one hand they're billing me after sending emails stating the property is in my possesion while simultaneously entering the premise without a 30-day notice to remove personal property and change the locks. They also will not inform you of their policies unless at their discretion and do not allow complaints/grievances. I would not trust this establishment.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>User reviews for Newport Apartments in Bellingham highlight some positive aspects that potential tenants might appreciate. The apartments offer good value for the price, particularly for budget-conscious renters, such as students attending the nearby Western Washington University. Its proximity to the campus and convenient access to public transportation are notable advantages. Additionally, some units include sizeable balconies, which enhance the living space. For those looking for a short-term commitment, the leasing flexibility after an initial six-month period presents a valuable option. This might appeal to students or professionals who require more adaptability in their living arrangements.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>In this article, while the user reviews do not overwhelmingly praise Newport Apartments, there are glimpses of satisfaction with certain features. One positive aspect frequently mentioned is the location's convenience, especially for students or those connected to Western Washington University. The property\u2019s close access to bus lines facilitates easy commuting, reducing daily hassle. The size of the one-bedroom units also receives appreciation, as it might provide adequate space for typical rental costs in the area. This combination of location and unit size creates a practical living environment for individuals prioritizing convenience with a moderate budget.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Several user reviews highlight notable drawbacks of residing at Newport Apartments, primarily concerning maintenance and communication. Issues such as stained carpets and malfunctioning laundry facilities detract from the overall living experience. While one tenant mentioned an efficient response to a flea problem, the initial lack of transparency regarding this issue raised concerns about management's communication. This reflects a need for improved pre-move-in inspections and clearer communication protocols. Furthermore, the coin-operated laundry facilities that require multiple drying cycles might lead to tenant frustration, indicating a need for upgrades or better maintenance of the amenities.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most concerning feedback revolves around allegations of unprofessional behavior by the property management. One tenant reported distressing experiences where management reportedly entered the unit and changed locks without proper notice, violating tenant rights as outlined by RCW codes. Additionally, they claimed that the staff withheld critical information regarding policies, sharing them only when convenient. Such actions, if accurate, suggest a severe breach of professional standards and tenant trust. This raises serious concerns for current and potential tenants about their security and the reliability of the management team. These unsettling experiences underscore a need for comprehensive improvement in management practices.</p></section>"
