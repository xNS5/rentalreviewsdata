      "review": "I'm 60 yrs old, and I have rented the same apartment in Woodland Townhomes since Aug 2012 (almost 11 yrs.) Speaking only from my own personal experiences.. Kris & Kim Fast have always been polite to me.. if your honest with them, if you respect them, they will respect you. I personally have never had a problem with management.. they've always given a 24-hr notice if they need to enter my apartment for any legit reason.\nThe maintenance man, Piers.. has always been nice & respectful towards me.. he's a thoughtful and understanding person.  Anna Fast who helps with management is polite and professional, it's always pleasant communicating with her.. she's a good person. Integrity & respect for others is everything, I recommend the Fast Property Management Team.",

My wife and I have had a great experience with them ...and that's not usually something tenants say of PMs.",

      "review": "Really helpful management company. The 1 issue I've had in the multiple years renting with them they had someone out that day to check out the issue and get it fixed.\nDoubly impressive being when that I split with my partner they helped him find a similarly priced place in their management portfolio.\nNever been more impressed with a management company than with these guys. 100% would recommend",
