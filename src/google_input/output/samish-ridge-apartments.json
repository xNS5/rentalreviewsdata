        "review": "I have lived here for five and a half years.  Snow season means shovels and ice melt at every entrance.  The slopping drive way is shoveled as much as possible. Truely the management cares.  Mowed during the summer and pet friendly.  K & M live on site and hire tenants to work on projects.  It is my favorite place (don't move much) in the last 23 years.  Not a slum at all.  Storage may be available on-site. Quiet too.",

The apartment manager Karen is one of the best people I know and treats every tenant as if they were family- she has done so much for me over the years. I feel like these apartments are truly home.",

The People that run it are really awesome and friendly, and they can fix most things, so you don't have to wait forever for a service appointment! There is plenty of parking, and their pet policy is very reasonable. There is a nice clubhouse(pool and ping pong table) and workout room. The only thing that could make this place better is a bike rack.",

        "review": "Best apartment I've ever lived in. Excellent value, mucho convenient, especially if you're a Western student because it's right next to the park and ride so you'll always have a spot on the bus. Pet friendly! Mel and the whole team are awesome, even Canada Man-- all friendly, responsive, and helpful. Be sure to apply soon soon soon because it's so great they rarely have vacancy. Small drawbacks: freeway noise and the ceilings/floors are a little thin so don't apply if you're a partier.",

Not only that, but their pet policy is fantastic!  I can happily have all three of my cats with no problem and the deposit was very reasonable.  This has been my favorite complex to rent at ever!",
