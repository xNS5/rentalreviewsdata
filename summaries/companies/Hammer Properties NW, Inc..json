A review mentioned a landlord's remarkable interest in ensuring a renter's contentment, and there have also been commendable mentions of staff going above and beyond, providing assistance outside regular business hours. The proximity to student campuses and the quality of some housing units also receive special mentions, suggesting that Hammer Properties can indeed provide an excellent living experience for some tenants.\n\n## The Great\n\nA few users have labeled their encounters with Hammer Properties as extraordinary.

The company was lauded for its fair rental prices and helpfulness regarding repairs\u2014factors that appeared to contribute significantly to the tenant's intention to renew their lease.\n\n## The Bad\n\nOn the downswing, some reviews call attention to undesirable experiences, including accounts of neglect and poor property conditions at move-in. Tenants report moving into properties with issues like visible mold, damage, and overall unsatisfactoriness in cleanliness and maintenance. Additionally, concerns were raised about the advertising of properties that were not actually available for rent, adding frustration to the already challenging housing search process.\n\nUsers also recount facing difficulties with the company's handling of financial matters. There are several accusations of inappropriately retained deposits and additional charges inflicted after move-out. Some tenants felt unfairly treated, having been charged for alleged damages without solid proof, pointing to a potential pattern of financial disputes between the company and its renters.\n\n## The Ugly\n\nThe more severe critiques of Hammer Properties are troubling. Several user reviews depict the company as exploiting and unresponsive, particularly to a market of college students seeking off-campus housing. Claims of unauthorized entry into rented properties and a lack of notice for maintenance visits have caused considerable distress and have led to feelings of disrespect toward tenant privacy.\n\nA particularly sore subject among the negative reviews is the handling (or lack thereof) of maintenance issues, with users describing a leak in their basement going unfixed for months and a myriad of safety concerns in the properties. Others speak of issues with communication, stating that there was no follow-up to serious problems reported to the management and that attempts to reach out were often ignored.\n\nThe company has made efforts to respond to some negative feedback, suggesting they are aware of the issues and are open to addressing them. However, specific examples cited in the user reviews, like being threatened with a lawsuit after a full deposit was withheld, reflect on the extreme dissatisfaction felt by some tenants. These experiences suggest an inconsistency that could severely undermine a renter's peace of mind and sense of home security.\n\nIn conclusion, while positive reviews reflect well on certain members of Hammer Properties NW, Inc.'s staff and specific instances of prompt and professional service, the negative reviews cannot be overlooked. Prospective tenants and property owners ought to consider these insights with caution and perhaps look for recent improvements and consistent responses from the company to concerns raised in these reviews."
