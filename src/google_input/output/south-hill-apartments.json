        "review": "Im really surprised this complex doesnt have a better rating. I thought the South Hill Apartments were lovely, and my time as a tenant here was hands down the best experience Ive had as a renter in Bellingham. The staff is friendly and helpful, neighbors were nice, and the location of the building itself is unbeatable. Its an old building, so its no surprise that there were somewhat frequent water shut offs, but they never lasted super long and we were always given a gracious heads up. This was perhaps the only negative thing I could think to say about these apartments. Its been a little less than a year since Ive had to move out and I really miss it!",

To get to downtown was just a short drive or 10-15 minute walk. The south hill neighborhood is beautiful. The views from the apartments are spectacular. The staff were super helpful and supportive. I will cherish my time spent living here.",

        "review": "Going on my second year here and could not be more impressed, particularly when comparing this site to other apartment rentals in Bellingham. I've never once had a problem with anyone here (neighbor or employee), in fact, the employees who work here are incredibly kind and friendly. Any maintenance normally happens within a day of requesting it, and the maintenance guy Jeff and his crew are always super friendly.\n\nOverall, I've thoroughly enjoyed myself here and the view just can't be beaten",

        "review": "The staff here try hard to accommodate everyone's request whether it is moving to another apartment, work orders or just general questions. Both office staff have at least 15 years experience in Property Management so Ms. Dumas needs to have the correct info before she writes a review. The staff here is quite qualified to run this property. To respond to Sarah's review,  there are not enough parking spots to accommodate all tenants so guests are required to park down on state street including weekends. She was not told by me that her boyfriend could park on site on weekends. Jeff  is our maintenance Lead who has been here for close to 13 years and only targets those vehicles parking on site without a site parking sticker. They are given a first warning notice and if a second warning is issued, it is automatically towed. Signs are also posted on the property.  Her boyfriend's car got towed when he got the second warning. Jeff also does work orders. The tenant is first called, then the work is completed usually the same day unless there is a part to be ordered.  We try not to inconvenience our tenants and do the job quickly and always clean the site before leaving. If he did leave the place in a mess as described, then that tenant should have called the office to complain not on the website. If she is not happy here as stated in her review as in her own words as old and falling apart,  the office would be glad to accept her notice to vacate once her lease is completed this spring. We here at South Hill try to make South Hill a safe, quiet and a wonderful experience to all who reside here. Anyone else who would like to write a review on their experiences here at South Hill (positive or negative) are more than welcomed. In fact, we look forward to hearing your comments.",

        "review": "Here were my main issues with living at South Hill Apartments for just over a year:\n\n1.  They are having some major issues with the piping in the building.  It's understandable, considering it's a very old building.  That doesn't change the inconvenience of them turning your water off roughly once a month for prolonged periods of time with minimal notice.\n\n2.  The water isn't good quality and the pipes are very old.  When you turn your water on after it had been shut off, the running water was dark brown in color.\n\n3.  The heat is all connected to the main boiler on the first story.  You never have any control over when they turn it on.  It seemed like they only turned it on when it was at or below freezing.  I'm assuming this was to save them money.\n\n4.  When the heat is turned on, the heater pipes clank incessantly.  Hopefully you're a sound sleeper, because if not, you'll be waking up at 4-5 AM when the telltale clanking begins.\n\n5.  The gas range in our kitchen had no ventilation.  We couldn't even use the oven without the entire apartment smelling like gas and setting off the smoke alarm.  Having no ventilation left the entire kitchen coated in a greasy film eventually, regardless of keeping things clean.\n\n6.  When we gave them 30 days notice to move out, we were informed that you can only give them notice on the 1st of every month if you don't want to pay extra.  We had to pay for almost two weeks when we were not occupying the apartment.\n\n7.  During the weeks leading up to our move out, they stopped by our apartment on two separate occasions to show it to prospective renters without giving notice.  We complained after the first time it happened, and then it happened again just a few days later.  Very unprofessional.\n\nThat being said, it is a shame we had such a negative experience at this property.  It is definitely located in a pretty nice area, and the price includes utilities - not to mention that rent is fairly cheap.  Well, now we know why.\n\nI would advise anyone thinking of moving in to look elsewhere.",

        "review": "I think this is one of the best places to live in Bellingham.  Affordable living with a view, clean and updated, full of light, and a friendly community.  The property managers are extremely friendly and reasonable, and go above and beyond what other managers do.  They are on-site and communicate regularly with tenants about updates, maintenance, etc, but are not nosy.  The maintenance crew is also on-site and keeps everything looking beautiful.  They respond quickly to requests and are very friendly.  This has been my favorite living experience so far since moving to town!",

        "review": "We were told in November of 2016 that there would be construction occurring in a unit adjacent to our apartment. For the next five months, we lived next door to a automated concrete sledgehammer banging away next to our bedroom. That five months included invasive and unprofessional behavior from maintenance staff and the construction staff that they hired. We had ant infestations for multiple months. The staff did not address the issue for multiple weeks sometimes and we ended up just stepping on dead ants in our bathroom for a few weeks at a time.\n\nMaintenance staff is required to call the tenant before entering the home for any reason other than emergencies. South Hill's maintenance staff likes to call right outside your door, if you don't answer they walk in. If you're in the shower, SURPRISE!\n\nWe were told when we moved in that we are required to keep the windows cracked because the boiler system that heats the entire Manor building provides a bit of moisture. Well, we did that and then the steam escaping out of the boiler system would rise up from under the apartment and flow directly into our bedroom window causing MOLD. Washington state law RCW 59.18.060 states that landlords are required to provide a weathertight home, with functioning water and heating. Steam from a leak was coming directly in the window and to stop the flow. The mold we found was unable to be looked at for four days after discovered because staff was gone on vacation. So, we had an independent indoor air quality specialist assess the situation. He informed us that we should clean up what we could and dry out the unit as quickly as possible. We took photos of the damage and cleaned the walls and the furniture, but when the South Hill maintenance staff looked at the mess, they condemned us for cleaning anything and told us they could do nothing but spray a mix of bleach and water. We are very uncomfortable that we were asked to ignore a health hazard. The rubble and construction material from the unit next door was stored in a pile outside our bedroom window. This blocked our view of the bay that we had been so happy to see before, and the tarps covering the mounds of dirt would loudly flap in the wind at night. We hoped that the construction noises would solve the clanging in the pipes but still, after all these months, we are kept from sleeping by a broken heating and water system that sounds like pots and pans rattling together in the pipes suspended above our bedroom.We were given a notice, on what was supposedly a final day of work that would disturb us, that work would begin at 10 a.m. Instead, at 7:40 a.m. we were woken by voices outside the window. By 8 a.m. power tools were loudly being used and the fumes and dust coming in the window smelled of chemicals and gasoline and set off both fire alarms in our unit. When we asked the maintenance staff if we could close the window, they said it was just the dirt from the pipes and recommended taking the batteries out of the fire alarms to stop them from going off. We stated we preferred to close the window and stop the toxic fumes from entering the unit all together. The recommendations given by the maintenance staff had no consideration for tenant safety or health. Long-term health issues can be attributed to toxic fumes from gas powered tools in confined spaces.\n\nNow comes the kicker: when I decided, enough is enough, I emailed the property manager. She did not respond for months, I sent letters and made phone calls too. It wasn't until I had emailed of one of her subordinates (who mentioned to me how repulsive my living situation has been and could not believe the treatment I received), that she finally responded to me. I requested a renegotiation of rent and outlined the reasoning and mentioned that I'd be willing to talk it over with civility, all I wanted was a little bit of reasonable compensation for the hell I lived through.\n\nAs a response she served me a 20 day termination of tenancy.\n\nCool.\n\nIf you want to live at South Hill Apartments, don't.",

        "review": "Make sure you read the fine print on the lease. When they mention the monthly rate, they say \"the rent is (X) amount per month untill adjusted by manager/landlord\", meaning they can raise your rent at anytime during your lease. This just happened to my mother. They told her it would be $975 a month for her lease, two months into the lease she gets a note on her door, saying that rent will be raised by $50 in August. She rented from them because it fit her budget. Now she will not be able to afford one of her medications because they upped the rent as she just started her lease.",
