      "review": "The employees were very friendly and the common areas were well-maintained. The bedrooms are very small, but there is a lot of storage space throughout the apartments. The windows only open about 6 inches from the bottom and there is no ventilation. It was unlivable in the summer and I had to couch surf because it was consistently at 95 degrees inside. There was also horrible chemical smells from high-VOC building materials. \n\nThe offsite parking is far away, expensive, and dangerous. I was put in quite a few bad situations while parking there, and my car was vandalized...twice. \n\nUpon moving out I spent days cleaning and left the apartment spotless.  Days later they sent everyone I know who was moving out a threatening email demanding at least $200. They managed to swindle over $1000 for carpet cleaning and a little repainting from me and my roommates. However, carpet cleaning is a move-in fee!",

          "text": "Thank you so much for providing us with your feedback about living at Stateside, Wren. When residents move out, we have to ensure that apartments are given to the next resident in a condition theyre comfortable moving into. This is often a higher level of cleanliness than the apartments are left to us in, and we saw this primarily with paint and carpet cleaning this turn. Photos and final account statement insight were emailed to you in October related to your concerns about the charges, but if you need to discuss further we are happy to do so over the phone. Stateside does not have any move-in fees that would include any kind of cleaning, so unsure as to what you're referencing there. We have not heard any complaints about chemical smells from the building materials, so please clarify where this odor was represented most if you could. Our off-site parking is managed by the City of Bellingham and they provide 24/7 security and monitoring. Any concerns or circumstances involved with that amenity should be properly reported so that the proper authorities can conduct an investigation. As this merely serves as a review response, we do hope that you understand we're trying to communicate effectively about the elements of your review, though would love for any further discourse to occur over the phone or in-office if the opportunity allows. Thank you again for your time, Wren.",

      "review": "I (tried) living here but quickly found it to be 80% a total money scheme directed at pet owners and students / 20% an actual space to rent equitably. \n\nThis place is largely geared towards a demographic of people who haven't rented before and simply do not know any better in terms of how the process gives and takes; it's an exchange between tenant and landlord.\n\nIn the case with Stateside, the narrative handed down from day 1 is that \"we are your dystopian overlords until your lease is up.\" \n\nI moved there because it was the only dog friendly, affordable option in Bellingham, sight unseen from NY because I wanted to start a new life there. Everything seemed nice and the staff seemed willing to help and communicate well throughout the whole process...so long as the concerns didn't in any way actually translate to addressing a real issue. That's because the people running the show here are under qualified, underpaid, and overworked, in conjunction with a business model that slightly resembles a pyramid scheme.\n\nThings seemed fine until a sprinkler system busted in the neighboring apartment, flooding the whole hallway at 3am and evacuating the building. According to a press release emailed to the residents, it was because a student had placed lights near the sprinkler head but upon asked my neighbor about it who lived in the same apartment, I was informed that there were actually no lights present on her ceiling and that she was receiving some form of compensation for keeping it on the hush. IE THEY CHEAPED OUT ON THE FIRE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND THEN BLAMED A STUDENT SCAPEGOAT WHEN IT FAILED\n\nI come home from work the next day, no communication, no warning that my apartment was going to be entered, to 150 decibel air fans and dehumidifiers strewn throughout the place (6 total) and took them out. \n\nYou can't sign the lease without them having the explicit right to relocate you at any time, and for me, after I took the fans out, they threatened me with just that if I didn't just be a good little boy and capitulate to terrible landlord practices that make the idea of having a piece of mind obsolete in this scenario. \n\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE NOT LANDLORDS, THEY ARE DYSTOPIAN ALGORITHMS TRYING TO VACUUM YOUR MONEY.\n\nI left 6 months ago because I couldn't get a response to replace my door handle that my dog had figured out how to open when I was at work, making the apartment no long feasible since my roommates were uninterested in allowing him to roam the common area or properly storing trash so he can't get to it. The apartment was no longer feasibly dog friendly at that point. \n\nA few days ago I got a bill from a collections agency for the rest of the sum of rent for AFTER they wouldn't address my dog's concerns! 7k\n\nThis was after PLEADING with the manager to let me out of my lease because it was completely shady.\n\nI urge anybody considering this place as a living option to keep looking in your search and to try to find the least built up organization possible to rent from. \n\nUnscrupulous, predatory, business model.",

          "text": "Maxwell, unfortunately, due to vacating your apartment before the lease was over, we had no other choice but to send your account to collections as required by Washington state law. As you know, we reached out a number of times to discuss matters, including the door handle issue, but you left before it could be addressed in a timely manner. Regarding the fire sprinkler incident, this was due to a plant hanging from it, and to accommodate residents affected by the minor flooding, not only did our maintenance team act swiftly, we also provided gifts cards for the inconvenience, of which you received. If you would like to discuss this further, our management team is happy to provide whatever details you need.",

It goes without saying we certainly are also very thankful for the maintenance crew comment, as they're essential to the operations here. We do regret that our operations aside from that have made your experience feel negative, primarily in the financial sense. If you'd like, we would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss any matters concerning fees/parking with you to further elaborate on pricing, structure and kinda why things are the way they are. If that conversation intrigues you, stop by the office and mention your Yelp review to our GM Laura and we can take things from there. Thanks again, Dylan!",

      "review": "Construction has been going on right below my unit for MONTHS. It is so loud we often have to leave our apartment. Other residents have complained and nothing has been done. Losing sleep almost daily now becasue the walls here are so thin it sounds like we are in a battle field as early as 7am. The managers have done nothing about this issue and said it would only last weeks. It's been months, DO NOT MOVE HERE.",

      "review": "Beware of off-site parking! \nMy daughter (Junior at WWU) signed a lease in May, 2021 for the 2021-2022 school year. At that time, the apartment building was not yet completely built and there were very few specifics available from Stateside (didn't know who roommates would be, etc.). She added an off-site parking space to her lease not knowing anything about it - but assuming it would be a reasonable distance away within a couple of blocks and it would be easier than having to constantly find street parking. \nThey did not provide complete information about the parking space (or cancellation policy) until move-in weekend in September. At that time she was told it was in an underground parking garage downtown (.6 miles away - and in the complete opposite direction of campus) and that she would have to move her car every 3 days. She does not feel safe in the parking garage when she's by herself - especially in the dark. \nShe immediately asked to cancel the space - and Stateside would not let her unless she can find another apartment resident to take the space over.  None of this information was spelled out in the lease at all, and once they had specific information they did not give her the option to opt out of that part of the contract. \nVery deceptive and very poor service especially for students who are likely signing a lease for the first time. \nMost other aspects of the apartment have gone well, but this is not unacceptible.",

      "review": "Stateside apartments has been extremely frustrating. Not really sure where to start. First of all, they have been terrible as far as the process of renewing goes. They have repeatedly threatened that our room isn't going to be available for the next leasing cycle (which is 6 months away) if we don't renew ASAP. Many of us are unsure about whether to renew, and these threats over email about taking our room away from us a half a year from the next lease don't help. They have been extremely shady overall about this stuff, claiming that they told us that our rent would go up, and then in turn raising our rent for the next leasing cycle over $100 a month, even though they never told us specifically that this rate would increase, and never contacted our guarantor about it. I am expected to pay $200 more than my roommate, for a smaller room in the same apartment, just because stateside feels like raising our rate because I haven't renewed yet, when again, the next lease isn't for MONTHS, and we had been planning on renewing. Stateside has also been awful about maintenance. They have now postponed their maintenance scheduled dates 3 or 4 times, on late notice, so we've been waiting around for them to do their inspections for weeks now, with little communication on when it'll actually happen. Stateside has also sent other threatening emails about fining their tenants for silly things that are not included in the leasing agreement. They have said that noise, not wearing masks, skateboarding inside and other small things will warrant a $100 fine from them, which is ridiculous. Overall a very vague, shady group that doesn't care about their tenants needs or opinions. If you're going to rent at stateside, keep all of the above in mind, and expect it to happen to you.",
