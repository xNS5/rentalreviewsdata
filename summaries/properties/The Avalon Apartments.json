      "review": "I rented at The Avalon from 2014-2015.  I decided I had to finally share my story, because I came across another review that said something that helped me to connect the dots with what happened to me there.  What was said is that the maintenance is there constantly to spy on tenants and is, in fact, the owners of the property.  You'll see why this piece of information is important...\nWhile I was there, I saw the \"Maitenance\"(man and woman) on site nearly every single day.  At the time I actually didn't mind it.  It is in old building, and I figured that they were renovating it one unit at a time.  It also gave me a false sense of safety.  I felt that I had a good rapport with them, and talked to them on many occasions.  I got the sense that they liked me, as I was a quiet, working professional that didn't ever have parties.  One time I had a work order for a plumbing issue, and they had even commented on how clean the place was, and how they liked how I decorated the apartment. When my lease was up I gave proper notice that I would be moving out, as I was moving across the country for my job.  I had paid over 900 in total for my damage deposit, and wanted to be sure I did everything I could to get it back.  I specifically asked \"Maitenance\" what I could do to insure that would happen.  The floors there are the original wood that they paint brown.  I had a very heavy table that had chipped some of the paint on the floor, and asked them if they would like me to repaint the area.  They told me not to worry about it as they already have the perfect matching color, and that I wouldn't be charged for small chips.  Other than that I left the apartment spotless, and in better condition than I found it.  Now comes the part when I got royally screwed: When I went to get my deposit back from Windermere Property Managment, it was for only about 100 dollars.  I was shown a series of pictures that were either old photos, or staged.  For example: there was a picture of the stove top(that I had left spotless) with crumbs and a long black hair on it. (I was blonde at the time). They used the chipped floor, which I was told not to worry about, to charge me hundreds of dollars to repaint the entire apartment.  I could have done the same job myself for 25 dollars had they not been deceptive about it.  There was also a very old rust spot on top of the refrigerator that I did not include on my move-in sheet, because I did not see it, and it's typically not a place people look.  Even the woman at Windermere told me that she could tell that it was there for much longer than I had lived there, and would \"work on getting my money back for that.\"  I never saw any of that money, or head back from her.  I contemplated taking them to small claims court, but since I moved so far away it was more trouble than it was worth.  These \"Owners/Maitenance\" are obviously taking advantage of their tenants, and double dipping.  Shame on them, and shame on Windermere Property Managment for allowing them to do it.  Future renters beware!  If you do decide to rent from them anyway, just be sure to take photos and video of everything before you leave so that you have proof of how you left it.  Lesson learned on my part.",

      "review": "TERRIBLE place to live DO NOT RENT HERE. I left my tiny studio clean and they only gave me 27% of my deposit back. They thought of every ridiculous absurd way to get as much money as possible. I was billed for things like \"needing a toothbrush to bleach the crown molding, toothbrush needed to bleach the baseboards, tooth brush needed to bleach the front and back side of doors, toothbrush needed to clean non working radiators, toothbrush needed to bleach the vinyl on the Windows, bleached the walls ect. These guys are thieves I don't know how anyone can justify charging $35 and hour for \"labor\" with the most ridiculous shit. The walls are incredibly thin you hear everything like your neighbors having sex at anytime of the day or night, you can hear every step your neighbors take every fart and sneeze as well, the water pressure and temperature sucks it's either scolding hot or freezing cold and the temperature constantly changes while it's running, I literally would have to listen for the pressure change and count to 3 and take a side step so I wouldn't  get blasted with frozen water out of the frozen tundra of an icey hell or blasted with heat melting water out of the fires of mordor. There's homeless people always rummaging through the garbage and the back of your vehicles if you park in the back. If you do not want to get royally fucked out of your security DO NOT live here. The property manager is incredibly nosey and will find any reason to fuck you and make your experience terrible. I lived there for 11 months and they came into my unit for an \"inspection\" 14 times.",

      "review": "I spent 2 months living at the Avalon Aparmtents and moved out about a month ago and have waited this long to write anything about it, honestly just because I needed time to cool down. \nI have never been treated as badly as I was by the property management at The Avalon Apartments and if anyone reading this review and looking at this property, please let this review sway you too keep looking because I would not wish for anyone else to have to go through this.  \n\nWe moved in when it was under Windermere managements and we enjoyed Jill as our agent from Windermere, The onsite property management was the problem. They have since dropped Windermere as the management company and begun their own management, Burns Reality. When they began to transition to this we were given the option to move out and jumped on it gratefully. \nTo start, the building itself is old and not very well maintained, they talk a lot of game about how they have worked so hard on the building, but we honestly couldn't tell. We got to know our neighbors fast because you can hear every movement they made. \nWe were quickly made to feel as unwelcome as possible around here, the maintenance people constantly snooping in our our first floor apartment and then when they found my roommates cigarette butt too close to the building, they proceeded to berate my roommate until she was crying. They then sent us a warning, threatening eviction. We quickly apologized and never did it again, but we were now on their bad list and they found every instance that could be considered against the rules and documented it without our knowledge, until one day they demanded us out. They had called our co-signers and essentially tattled on us and told them we were being evicted. \nWe talked to Jill who explained the situation and that the property management were in the wrong for this and we were just being given the option to leave and we took it. A few weeks before, we had been robbed in this apartment and neither of us felt safe here and we're excited to leave this place and the rude property management. \nSo we began packing and found a new place and on the last day of our lease we went to turn in our keys to Jill who said he'd wait a few hours before notifying them we were out, with a few things left inside we were waiting for someone stronger to help with, and while we were gone, the new property management removed our locks with our things still inside and when we tried to talk to the person on-site about it, she ran away yelling she didn't want to talk to us and ran into a vacant apartment. Luckily were able to turn the lock manually and get our stuff out. (keep in mind our lease was up at midnight that night, no sooner). We began to load the stuff into our car and she then re-appeared on the phone calling the cops on us no less! So we then had to wait 45 minutes for the police, not to show up, but call us and tell us to just leave the property if we were done because obviously this lady was crazy. \nBut wait.... theres more...\nSO after moving out and telling people this story, many told told me to go to court and I was and still am thinking about it, but after emailing them and asking for detailed notes for our security deposit and having them again send it to our co-signers because we had \"no forwarding address\" (yes, we left it when we moved out) to tattle on us again. Luckily both our co signers see how unfair these people are. But, of the $1400 we out down, we received about %500 back, with money taken out for \"hair clogging the drains\" and \"fruitlies in the kitchen\" and my favorite, \"we had to clean cigarette smoke off the walls\"... nope.... never smoked inside...sorry pals. Also this was after they locked us out and called the cops on us while we were moving, leaving us no time to clean or anything before we left. \nI am a very fair person and I understand a mistake, but this was blatantly rude  and taking advantage of 2 nineteen year old girls. SO to anyone looking to move in here, please please dont!",

  "summary": "# The Avalon Apartments: An Unvarnished Review\n\nThis article intends to provide a well-balanced perspective on The Avalon Apartments by summarizing user reviews. It's important to note that while these reviews have been summarized in this article by ChatGPT, the reviews themselves are user-generated, serving only as a tool to aid potential renters in their decision-making process regarding property management companies or rental properties.\n\n## Good\n\nWhen searching for a good angle to praise The Avalon Apartments, one might be stretching to find a silver lining. Given the consistently low ratings across all user reviews, it seems difficult to identify any positive standout features that could be highlighted in this section. Renters consider various factors, such as location and the potential charm of older buildings, but these reviews do not capture such elements favorably or otherwise, and therefore can't be asserted as positive attributes in good faith.\n\nThe initial expectations of tenants may have been met with a sense of security, as one reviewer mentioned the frequent presence of maintenance staff. This could, in some contexts, be construed as a proactive approach to upkeep and tenant safety. However, upon further investigation and experience, this perception quickly deteriorated for the reviewer, which leads us into the next section.\n\n## Great\n\nIn the interest of fairness, this article strives to maintain a balanced view and present any areas where The Avalon Apartments truly excelled. Regrettably, based on user reviews, such examples are nonexistent or not reported upon by the reviewers. It is paramount for a property management company to leave a positive, lasting impression on its tenants, and, in this case, the great experiences one might hope to document are notably absent.\n\nOne might hope to find mention of excellent amenities, swift responses to maintenance issues, friendly staff, or a vibrant community that could greatly enhance the living experience. Instead, no such commendations were made in the user reviews, suggesting these are not features that The Avalon Apartments is known for or that they were not experienced by the reviewers in question.\n\n## Bad\n\nThe reviews for The Avalon Apartments feature several disappointing accounts related to the condition and management of the property. One reviewer's experience began positively but took a sudden turn upon moving out. Despite having left the apartment in better condition than found, including a proactive offer to fix minor damage, they were accused of leaving behind a mess and charged exorbitantly for repairs and cleaning, shrinking their sizable security deposit to a minor sum.\n\nAnother user review echoes this sentiment of unjust financial treatment. The tenant describes being charged outlandishly high labor costs for cleaning tasks, purportedly requiring the use of a toothbrush to clean minute details of the apartment. A straightforward cleaning process was twisted into a litany of petty and expensive charges, contributing to an impression of deceit and greed from the property management.\n\n## Ugly\n\nSome stories detailed in the reviews verge on alarming, with one reviewer portraying the property management as invasive and confrontational. Their recounting of maintenance staff frequently spying, along with distressing encounters that led to baseless threats of eviction, paints a concerning picture of tenant treatment at The Avalon Apartments. The reviewer also describes excessive noise, problematic water temperature, and security issues, compounding the sense of a poorly managed property.\n\nAnother tenant's narrative takes a dark turn as they recount the property management's behavior at the end of their lease. With locks changed prematurely and possessions still inside the apartment, they found themselves in an untenable position, leading to a confrontation with the property manager and an unwarranted police call. Additionally, the final financial dealings pertaining to the security deposit were handled unprofessionally, leaving the reviewer feeling cheated and disrespected.\n\nThis article has summarized the user reviews for The Avalon Apartments, which, based on the user-supplied content, suggest significant room for improvement. It's imperative for renters to consider these experiences while making their decisions but also to perform their own due diligence. Remember, experiences may vary, and the present article is but a tool to aid in a broader, informed search."
