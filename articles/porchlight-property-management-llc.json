        "review": "This may be a a 2 part review, this is the review for the start of my rental process:\nI had the pleaser in meeting Haleigh for 3 different available apartments- She was super sweet, Kind and a joy to talk to. I originally applied for we will call it \"C\" apartment it was cute small but cozy so I applied. It was painless super easy & on-line love that, the following day I called and asked her if there was a way that I could change my application for a different property sense rent was a little cheaper and I would like to see them she agreed met me there an hour after our conversation. Picked the one I liked the best and with in minuets of getting home my application had been changed. I have emailed her a few time with questions or answer to her questions and she has always been Super sweet.  So far its a 4 star review for me to be continued.......",

        "review": "I hate writing bad reviews but this couldn't go unnoticed. We were excited to move into the La Villa apartments and at first the staff was really helpful and nice. As time progressed, we had a few problems with our upstairs neighbors (a couple of times it was ineed our faults, we got a noise complaint for our FIRST day moving in and for having a party, which we take complete ownership of that) but things progressively started to get worse with them. Like they literally came to our apartment and smashed our pumpkins that we had outside and left a mess. I was then confronted multiple times on different occasions by them as well as another lady who lived a few apartment while I was by myself. Even after seeking help from the property managers, no moves we're made to ensure our safety.\n\nWe've just recently moved out and we're charged a $400 cleaning fee even though we took a few days to deep clean it. They even commented on how clean it was and still charged us. As well as almost charging us for a one of the bedroom lights that stopped working even though I had emailed weeks prior to our move out date. Had it not been for us going to the office and confronting them they most likely would've taken our deposit for something we had no control over. These are just a couple of our experiences.\n\nFor having multiple properties, they really lack on the communication department. I hope the best for them but I 1/10 do not recommend.",

          "text": "We're disappointed to hear you didn't have a great experience with Porchlight. We try to foster good relationships, but always recommend that tenants reach out to law enforcement when they have problems with neighboring tenants or feel threatened. We don't have cameras on a lot of our properties, so it's not always possible to resolve issues when individuals have differing perspectives of events. \nWe make it a general rule never to comment on the cleanliness of a unit prior to keys being turned in, because a unit can appear clean on the surface, but actually still need quite a few hours of work.\nWe recently acquired a new full-time Maintenance Coordinator, so any deficiencies in communications regarding repairs and maintenance have been improved upon!  We're sorry La Villa didn't work out for you long term, but wish you the best."

        "review": "DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!\n\nThey withheld $430 of our deposit and refused to do a move-out walkthrough. They also never repaired a window that wouldnt close completely the whole 12 months we lived there.\n\nAs for the deposit, $320 was for cleaning even though we cleaned the townhouse thoroughly and paid over $200 for professional carpet cleaning before we moved out. They claim they had to pay a house cleaner for 8 hours at her rate of $40 per hour. Were from Northern California and house cleaners around here dont even make that much. $45 was for a towel bar that apparently came loose from the wall, even though I have pictures that show it was still in place when we moved out. $65 was for blinds that were broken when we moved in. We told them on the move-in checklist and in person, and they never replaced them. They have since returned this $65, but its annoying that they didnt even bother to look at the checklist before returning the deposit. They stopped responding to my emails, so Im now going to have to go through small claims court to get the $365 they still owe.",

        "review": "I had applied for a commercial unit porch light was responsible for. After a month of emailing back and forth,  I was informed that I had been approved for the unit and that they would write up the lease for it.  And since i had been approved i had turned down other location availabilities. A few days later I inquired about when the lease would be ready so I could sign it and move forward with planning. They later responded saying that they were no longer going to rent out said unit,  as they were expanding and needed more room for offices (they rent the neighboring unit). They said they had another unit just up the street available, but for a higher rent (over double the original units price).  I stopped and looked at the second unit and low and behold, the unit had an office layout, and was roughly 3x the size of the original unit i wanted. Which I could have made work but the second unit didn't have the amenities that I needed, specifically water and drainage, which the first unit already had in place. So I inquired about what it would take to get unit #2 to a point I could use it for the purpose I needed. They never responded back to me.\n\nOverall I feel like they didn't want my business as a neighboring business. Which I would have understood if they said such a thing right away once i told them my intentions for the unit from the very beginning. But if they needed to expand their business and needed more room for OFFICES, they should have considered moving 100 yards up the street into the building that was significantly bigger and was already set up for offices. Leaving the original unit i had applied (and been approved for) open.",

Charged 40$ TWICE for showing UNAVAILABLE TO APPLY APARTMENTS.\nWaste of time and money. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!\n\nUPDATE: Both charges already refunded by my bank!\nThey continue to lie even in their reply. Not even mentioning that their staff been late for a meeting, showing me 2! Apartments that were NOT AVAILABLE. And charging a fee for that! What are you talking about treatment or documentation liars?\nI AM HAPPY NOT TO DEAL WITH YOU PROFESSIONALS.

          "text": "Hi Vitaliy, I'm sorry you had a negative experience with our company. Properties have been renting very quickly lately, and we're not always immediately aware when someone applies online for one of our units. Also, documents we requested from you to support your applications were not provided promptly, which left the opportunity for others to apply. We only charge one application fee, per adult, regardless of how many showings. You applied with another adult, so you were each charged one application fee. After receiving the requested information, our staff person called to offer you a different unit, and was told you had found a different property to rent. Based on your treatment of our staff, we don't regret our hesitancy in approving your applications."

        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Our policy is to conduct a final walk-through after the tenants turn in keys. In this case, the tenants dropped the keys through our night slot over a weekend, and by Monday morning, the owners had moved back into the property (without notifying us of their return date). The home was 20+ years old, and had been occupied by the same tenants for 7+ years, and there was undeniably some wear and tear. The home was also quite dated, and the owners had told us they would be remodeling prior to moving back in, so its possible we weren't as diligent near the end of the tenancy (since there had been no obvious damage during any of our visits).The tenants had a mentally disabled child (who grew to maturity) while residing there, as well as an emotional support animal, and there was some pretty significant damage to walls, trim, cabinets, flooring, etc. We sent a contractor to the home to provide an estimate for repairs, but he was turned away. We told the owners we needed to send the tenant a statement, or refund of their deposit within 21 days, but they didn't send their estimated charges until six days after the deadline. Prior to that, we assessed the damages (based on our standardized list of charges), sent the tenant a statement and retained their deposit. We billed the tenant, several thousand dollars, which we believe they would've eventually paid, had the owner not taken legal action. We were legally not permitted to send them to collections, due to Covid-19 restrictions. The owner is pursuing payment of an amount we believe is equivalent to the cost of a significant remodel.\nOur creed has always been \"Adhering to the Golden Rule to provide the gold standard in property management\", and we strive to always treat our people (and our properties) as we would want to be treated. We are disappointed when someone isn't happy with our service, but fortunately that is a rare occurrence!\n"

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Client experiences with Porchlight Property Management LLC have highlighted instances of good service, including prompt and helpful assistance in the rental process, which for many is a first-time encounter with a property management company. Positive feedback emphasizes the convenience of the online application process and the receptivity and helpfulness of the staff in handling inquiries and apartment showings. For example, one user was pleased with the seamless transfer of their application to a different property that better suited their needs, thanks to the adaptable and accommodating nature of the staff. Furthermore, the personalized approach by staff members seems to complement the efficient professional service that has been experienced by some renters.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Several reviewers offer substantial praise for the company's staff, citing specific employees who have delivered exceptional service and projecting a general sentiment of professionals who are not only adept at their roles but also shine as individuals. Tenants have appreciated the swift response to maintenance issues, feeling that their concerns are taken seriously and dealt with promptly. Comments exhibit a sentiment that the staff at Porchlight makes a genuine effort to create a positive rental experience, going above and beyond what might be expected from a management company.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, some user reviews point towards areas where Porchlight Property Management LLC is perceived as falling short. Complaints of poor communication and a perceived lack of fairness in handling tenant relations indicate room for improvement. Certain accounts describe how the company purportedly failed to address safety concerns raised by tenants or neglected to perform move-out walkthroughs, which resulted in dissatisfaction and a sense of negligence. Furthermore, instances of alleged unfair deposit charges and a lack of responsiveness to property maintenance issues cast a shadow over the user experience, leaving some tenants feeling less than satisfied with the company's management practices.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Some tenants have labeled their experience with Porchlight as particularly distressing, with one reviewer accusing the company of dishonesty in its business dealings. On more severe notes, allegations include mismanagement resulting in significant unexpected expenses for clients, with reports of miscommunication leading to missed rental opportunities. Another account accuses the company of making unfounded accusations regarding the behavior of a pet, which greatly upset the tenant. While these reviews mark the extreme end of negative experiences, they nonetheless underscore the importance of consistent, transparent dealings and clear communication from any property management company.</opcion></section>"
