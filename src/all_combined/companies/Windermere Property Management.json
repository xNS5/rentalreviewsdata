      "review": "I rented from a private owner (he rents several properties) beginning of 2019. June 2022, I filed a protection order against my ex. & was awarded the home. The owner attempted to evict daughter & I. I asserted my rights & the notice was rescinded. After filing a complaint w/ HUD, the owner hired Windermere to deal with the hysterical woman that I am. I was EXTREMELY hopeful as there had been harassment & retaliation from the owner. I received a letter on my door mid-August. Windermere took exactly 2 weeks to verify after numerous calls. It also said if we had paid Sept. to the owner, that was fine, which we had by this time. Also, that a walk-through inspection to be conducted & that if refused I will be charged $100.00. Personally, I try not to open with threats when I begin a relationship. At the inspection 9/6 I advised them that our refrigerator hadn't been working. When stated that its difficult eating out of a freezer, her comment was \"that's good, at least your freezer is working\". It did not. We were eating out of a chest freezer we had brought into the home. I assumed she wrote it down while taking notes when asking my daughter & I if there are any maintenance requests to be fixed. Nope. I had to email & voicemail, & deal with the owner & his hostile & belittling texts. Eventually after an educated repair person confirmed that it was no longer working, we received a refrigerator 10/13. As I had been a month-to-month tenant for over 3.5 years with zero rent increases promised and obliged at $1525.00 per month, Windermere decided to toss a new lease at me starting at $1600.00 effective immediately due Sept. rent that had already been paid. Included was another increase, now $1700.00 effective 1/1/2023. Then \"expectations\", my parents were more lenient w/ rules & regulations when I was a child. I advised I would not be signing the lease & wish to remain month to month. 1/31 I received notice with the threat of unlawful detainer if we're not gone by 4/30 as the owner intends to sell the home. I asked if the other person on the lease had been notified as his items were still on the property. I was told they do not see anyone else listed. I let them know there is a protection order in place so if they could please communicate that, I'd appreciate it. I am still waiting to hear back. Upon the overwhelming communication as to what MY responsibilities are in the move out, that is all that was heard. Windermere was notified of my departure and that my ex could gather his items and assist in the cleaning. As soon as possible they did the walk through and give me their opinion on how the place looked. I asked for a copy of the rent increase that went into effect in Sept. I STILL have yet to receive a response. After a couple of weeks, I reached out & was told everything had been removed from the house & it was in the process of being cleaned at the direction of the owner. My ex has every character trait of narcissistic personality disorder. His stuff was #1 priority in the meaning of life. Him leaving everything confirmed my suspicions. I am disappointed that it was not communicated to me. Whatever. I also was not surprised when told that he's in the process of having the protection order amended & the owner has written a new lease for him to move back into the home 4/1 at $1,600.00 a month. I think back to May of 2022 & how I was done with my relationship & done with being punished for having the wrong response or thoughts or feelings or actions, etc. I ultimately didn't care if I had to live in my car. THANK YOU, WINDERMERE,...FOR MAKING THAT DREAM COME TRUE :o) I apologize as I believe this to be the longest review written ever. Being how I have relocated; I have also lost access to my therapist. So, this will have to do for now. I wish I could say I'm extremely grateful for them reaching out and apologizing after the threats, eviction, being notified that the owner never truly intended to sell, and completely ignoring my rights as a survivor of domestic abuse. But I'm still waiting for them to get back to me.",

House was brand new (still getting finished when we signed the lease, couldn't move in for a week) but had mud under the stove, scuffs throughout the house, ect...\n\nA year later (no longer on lease, but month to month) we get a notice saying that they were upping the rent by $50. The letters were sent out on the 7th, the last day in which a tenant can inform them that they intended to move without paying for the next month. We informed them on the 15th. Given when we moved in, this was our last day to inform them that we were leaving. Everything was going fine until they said we had to pay for the next month. We called them out on the date of the letters. We also informed them about how we were not allowed to move in for a week despite already paying (we received not back pay for this week either). We also consulted a lawyer on this, who said they were in the wrong.\n\nA few weeks passed, we moved into another place, everything seemed fine. That is, until they sent us an email saying we owed them $500!! They were charging us for the following month's rent, professional carpet, and house cleaning. The house was completely spotless when we returned it, there were no holes in the walls, and there was nothing in the lease about professional house cleaning, only carpet. That place probably looked better than when we moved in.\n\nWe should have sued them. Never, NEVER again!!

      "review": "I have quite the story to share with the public about Windermere Property Management of Bellingham. I would also highly recommend that you visit windermerewatch.com for more valuable information. \n\nMy boyfriend and myself signed a lease with Windermere on a place located in Ferndale back in July 2017. I had already been through several other local property management companies and had bad experiences with two others in simply applying for a place and by way of misrepresentation of properties and wasting time looking at them and or applying for them just to find out they were in really bad shape unlike the photos led one to believe. I was actually under the false impression that Windermere was a reputable business. Unfortunately that was FAR from the truth. \n\nOn July 1st we began moving our things to Ferndale, actually my boyfriend did as I was to be flying out of Sea-Tac the following morning at 7:00 am. I stayed back to pack and we left for Sea-Tac that afternoon as we had a hotel room so that I didn't have to be on the road in the middle of the night to drive there from up here. We had dinner and went to our hotel where Bruce said his throat was sore. He said it was burning. I was concerned about it as my trip the next day was to visit my Father who was in the hospital with complications from Leukemia/Chemotherapy. I was worried about myself becoming sick while I was visiting. I never did get sick but I spoke with Bruce everyday I was gone and he said he was not feeling well everyday I was spoke with him. \n\nI returned to Seattle a few days later and spent my first night in our new place in Ferndale. I woke up that first night several times coughing. I specifically recall wondering what was irritating my throat as it was not a cough that felt like I was becoming sick. Just an irritating, dry, unproductive cough. This was the beginning of a nightmare. I started to not feel well in all kinds of ways. My throat was burning, I felt sick to my stomach, and I kept coughing. \n\nThe next thing that happened was the second night at our place. As it was July, it was hot out. I had several windows open trying to cool the place off. While downstairs in our bedroom I suddenly began to feel as though I was going to suffocate. I had the window in our room wide open and still I felt like I could not breathe adequately. I began talking about not being able to sleep in our room and having to get out of there and panicking. I could smell something that I would describe as pollution. It was strong. I was about ready to have my boyfriend call 911 I was so scared about suffocating. \n\nThe next day we drove to our storage unit and as we were unloading our Haul in Ferndale our neighbor whom we shared the duplex with came outside on her front porch and lit up. Cigarette. This was surprising to me as they advertised all of there units as no smoking. Being a former smoker I did not really want to be around smokers because it has not been a year since I quit. What happened next was unreal. Our neighbor proceeded to tell me how she had to have her front porch replaced. She had set it on fire by putting a cigarette butt in a can without enough liquid in it and it started her porch on fire. The fire dept. was called and the porch was so bad it had to be replaced. So now I have rented a place next door to someone who has already started a fire. \n\nWithin a week another neighbor in the building next door to us flicked his cigarette into the bark in front of his place and my boyfriend came home from work to find it on fire. \n\nAs for the burning throat, suffocation fears? The property had been sprayed with Crossbow in a manner that was done without any regards for people living there. I have over 200 pictures of this massive application of known carcinogenic herbicide. Windermere let us out of our lease but did absolutely nothing to help us relocate. In fact they actually retaliated against me when after 5 weeks of daily poisoning I became impatient and emailed them letting them know I was very upset with their unresponsiveness. I documented everything daily. We got out of there after two of the worst months of my entire life. God knows what long term health impacts we may suffer. \n\nI can tell you all this much, Windermere did not care one bit about us and the horror we had to deal with worrying about the lady next door and the herbicide issue.

She checked and said yes you can apply for this one but we already have one application pending.  Furthermore, she explained if I want to apply I have to fill out  an application and pay $40.00 fee and wait for her manager to check and make a decision about approving or disapproving my application.  She said they already collected $40.00 for that place from previous applicant who is waiting for answer.  Then I requested to talk to her manager.  She connected me w/a designated broker SANDY JONES!  Wow!  What a lunatic and pure idiot is that SANDY JONES!  SANDY JONES said by law they can charge $40.00 fee for as many applicants as they wish/apply for the same unit.  Unbelievable!

I don't want to know how. They don't return calls or emails. Also a few months ago I changed my online payment method from auto pay to a one time bank draft. I have never missed a payment and the money was drafted from my bank account on time. Nevertheless I came home to an eviction notice on the 15th stating I had not paid.

I read somewhere that it's the law for carpets to be cleaned between tenants, and that's why there is Always a cleaning fee no matter how clean you leave it. I guarantee no vacuum clean ever touched the carpet much less a carpet shampooer. I did it myself once I identified the smell coming from the carpet upstairs as being pet related. Pets aren't even allowed. One of the garage remotes didn't work when we moved in which was fine since we didn't need it. I listed it in the form when we moved in as needing to be fixed, and 10 months later I came home to a note on the door stating that they would be entering the apartment- again- for repairs/maintenance. I left the remote out-- again- and behold it works now. The actual property itself is nice enough, but I've been in other Windermere properties that were downright nasty. It just depends on how well previous tenants kept things. I could keep going... but I don't have all day.",

She ignores emails and maintenance concerns, it took 4 weeks to get my ceiling fan fixed, last time I checked it was supposed to be done within 10 days. There is black mold that she is ignoring throughout the building, not to mention other  problems. I hope this company can get there sh.. together and maybe upper management will get rid of the property manager!",

      "review": "Windermere was the Property Managment company for The Avalon Apartments while I lived there from 2014-2015.  I decided I had to finally share my story, because I came across another review that said something that helped me to connect the dots with what happened to me there.  What was said is that the maintenance is there constantly to spy on tenants and is, in fact, the owners of the property.  You'll see why this piece of information is important...\nWhile I was there, I saw the \"Maitenance\"(man and woman) on site nearly every single day.  At the time I actually didn't mind it.  It is in old building, and I figured that they were renovation it one unit at a time.  It also gave me a false sense of safety.  I felt that I had a good rapport with them, and talked to them on many occasions.  I got the sense that they liked me, as I was a quiet, working professional that didn't ever have parties.  One time I had a work order for a plumbing issue, and they had even commented on how clean the place was, and how they liked how I decorated the apartment. When my lease was up I gave proper notice that I would be moving out, as I was moving across the country for my job.  I had paid over 900 in total for my damage deposit, and wanted to be sure I did everything I could to get it back.  I specifically asked \"Maitenance\" what I could do to insure that would happen.  The floors there are the original wood that they paint brown.  I had a very heavy table that had chipped some of the paint on the floor, and asked them if they would like me to repaint the area.  They told me not to worry about it as they already have the perfect matching color, and that I wouldn't be charged for small chips.  Other than that I left the apartment spotless, and in better condition than I found it.  Now comes the part when I got royally screwed: When I went to get my deposit back from Windermere Property Managment, it was for only about 100 dollars.  I was shown a series of pictures that were either old photos, or staged.  For example: there was a picture of the stove top(that I had left spotless) with crumbs and a long black hair on it. (I was blonde at the time). They used the chipped floor, which I was told not to worry about, to charge me hundreds of dollars to repaint the entire apartment.  I could have done the same job myself for 25 dollars had they not been deceptive about it.  There was also a very old rust spot on top of the refrigerator that I did not include on my move-in sheet, because I did not see it, and it's typically not a place people look.  Even the woman at Windermere told me that she could tell that it was there for much longer than I had lived there, and would \"work on getting my money back for that.\"  I never saw any of that money, or heard from her again.  I contemplated taking them to small claims court, but since I moved so far away it was more trouble than it was worth.  These \"Owners/Maitenance\" are obviously taking advantage of their tenants, and double dipping.  Shame on them, and shame on Windermere Property Managment for allowing them to do it.  Future renters beware!  If you do decide to rent from them anyway, just be sure to take photos and video of everything before you leave so that you have proof of how you left it.  Lesson learned on my part.",

There seems to be a real lack of communication in the office and absolutely no care for their customers. Too bad it's too late to find an apartment with a private company.

I phoned and was asked for some basic information [about the house] that was left for Sandy.  I didn't receive a call back.  I set rent at a very fair price, and have a nice home I may well retire to.  My last tenant was in the house 6 years, so I decided what the heck, I'd continue managing the property myself.  Ironically, I had mentioned to the receptionist that there was a yelp review noting their office hadn't returned a call, thinking it would ensure a prompt call back - it apparently had the opposite effect for me.\n\nWood floor refinishers are booked out a month, but they called back, and did so right away.
