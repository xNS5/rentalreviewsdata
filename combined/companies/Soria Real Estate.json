She was sent as \"An appraiser\" from Piazza Realty Property Mgmt, and low & behold, she was with another agent with the last name of Piazza! (No appraisal was done, just a lie to get them on the property and in my home. LOL\n She basically told me, we are going to start bringing people through your house whenever we please, even if nobody is home!\nI told her I would rather move out than face that type of invasion of my privacy.\nShe snidely replied (SEVERAL TIMES) You better get busy and move then!\nAfter about the 4th or 5th repetition of this statement, I used my outside voice and told her I heard her the 1st time & invited her to leave my property.\nUpon signing the papers at my new residence, I relayed this info to my realtor & when I told him what her name was, he rolled his eyes.. Apparently she has a reputation..\nI will never do business with them or recommend them.",
