But after being in the unit for 10-15 minutes, my partner and I came out covered in fleas. If you are considering this property, PLEASE CHECK FOR FLEAS. It might have just been this unit, but it might be a problem in the entire complex. Other than that the management was nice, but I really question their integrity and transparency by allowing us to tour a flea infested apartment. I have pictures of the fleas as well.",

One user reported a negative experience during a tour of a specific unit, which was reportedly infested with fleas and had issues such as mold and mildew around the windows. This raises questions about the property management's oversight and their responsibility in ensuring rental units are in a suitable condition for prospective tenants.

The specific mention of flea infestations in a unit suggests a possible ongoing issue with pest control that the property management has not adequately addressed. Allowing potential tenants to tour unsanitary units indicates a lack of transparency and integrity, which could easily lead to reputation damage in the community. Residents expecting a clean and healthy living environment may find such practices unacceptable.</p><p This raises concerns about the overall maintenance standards of the property and points to an urgent need for better management oversight. Without a clear commitment to addressing tenant concerns and improving the living experience, the potential for a negative apartment reputation could haunt Villa Bonita Apartments in the long term. It is crucial for the management to take immediate action to rectify any ongoing issues and enhance their communication with tenants to rebuild trust.</p></section>"
