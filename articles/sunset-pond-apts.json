Piles of trash all over balconies, throwing trash over the edge, screaming and yelling from other units. People park huge vehicles in compact spaces and others have to crawl in and out of cars. The office is always closed and the staff mean and rude.\n\nMy daughter was also harassed by homeless people and we called the police on several occasions. The police said the landlords were responsible to keep homeless people off of peoples patios and that motion lights/cameras should be installed. When I contacted the management they said it wasn't their problem.\n\nMy daughter has been targeted by rude bitter people who excuse the behavior of some and harass others.",

Inside: overflowing toilets, standing water inside that management not only won't care about but would then probably charge you for water damage upon move out. \n\nI was forced to pay other peoples bills when I lived here or threatened with eviction. I was never compensated for their mistake, just treated with hostility. \nI was also forced to pay for the carpets to be replaced when I moved out based on how the carpets looked on the bottom once ripped out, not the top that you can see. They did not let me see the state the bottom of the carpet upon move in yet that's what they judged it off of upon move out... they really just make their own rules here and will continue to take advantage of people\n\nDon't risk it!

Our apartment came with a discount and even though we had our rent raise it was still a very good price compared to those in town. The front office people were always kind to us, the maintenance here are hard workers and treat you with kindness. Overall we enjoyed our experience here.",

        "review": "Apartment has great view of the pond- Third floor, great window and balcony. We moved into the maintenance manager's old place so everything was in working order, cheap carpeting and plastic shower inserts, but very livable. We cleaned when me moved in. Parking spaces are very small and cars will be dinged by doors. I did also hear of a few neighbors cars being stollen.\n \nBeware of move out fees! We moved out and cleaned, but it was an off time when we were leaving so the apartment manager did not check us out. They charged us 5 hours of cleaning to a total of $159.87. Fine, whatever, I have always walked through before and if anything was not up to par, I would re-clean, but it was cleaner than when we moved in. We had steam cleaned the carpet, oven was clean, bathrooms spotless, balcony wiped down (moss & mold-less). We paid the bill, check cleared, no problem. Then a month later, we have collections trying to recollect this. \n\nThe office simply does not have their stuff together. Incorrectly sending a paid bill to collections should have some reprocussions, but it simply doesn't. \n\nRead more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/WA/Bellingham/Sunset-Pond-Apartments_360734772298226/review-111205729#ixzz2jh5WuC2P",

A place to get away after a long day and get a quick workout in or soak in the hot tub.  The main complaint is the tight parking spaces and a lack of them for guests.",

Karl and Jeeter always are prompt, efficient and friendly. They helped me out more times than I can count. They kept the apartments, community rooms and parking lots looking clean and presentable. \n\nThe only reasons why the apartments themselves do not rate 5 stars in my book was the noise from the neighbors beside me penetrated through my walls, and the townhouse parking, although covered, was further away from my unit, so my children and i often got wet before getting to our car. That's Bellingham for ya, not that we mind to much.\n\nI highly recommend this complex and if my husband and I don't end up purchasing a house, we'll more than likely reside there again.",

We were robbed in multiple ways including, by a intruder, of our deposit, paying more due to fabricated lies of how we kept the condition of the place, management is not approachable and non supportive. After having a truder enter our apartment, we were verbally told that we could purchase security devices that would be reimbursed. Management refused to pay and stated she did not agree to that statement. Also, kept and left the space very clean to have lies stated of the condition the space was left in. Also, have to pay more than double the deposit. Very disappointed and definitely not recommend!",

Location is pretty great.\nThere's plenty of homeless in the area,  but they mainly keep to themselves.  Cars get broken into,  but there's not much you can do to change that.. it's the area.

For the rent amount, you can't get better square footage.  The property: Free assigned, covered parking, large indoor pool, hot tub and sauna, nice workout room , pool table in clubhouse and yes, you can reserve the clubhouse for a party or gathering! Water, sewer and garbage is paid which is excellent! Walk-ability: Within walking to stores, movie theatre, restaurants, etc... On Site manager and Staff:  Kasha is a highly trained professional manager who happens to live on site.  This is getting rare as most apartment management companies are faceless and have no real vested interest in their home.  This is her home and she continually makes property improvements. The maint. staff are friendly and prompt. The housekeeper/groundskeeper does an excellent job as well.  We're moving to a warmer climate but I would recommend Sunset Pond Apartments.",

The pool and clubhouse is kept in excellent condition and a great place to have a gathering or just relax at. The office lady Kasha is amazing. She is so kind and professional. She stays on top of keeping the complex well maintained and running as smoothly as possible. If I call with a maintenance request she put the order in right away and has the issue addressed. Kasha does an amazing job and I don't think she is given enough praise for all that she does.\nThank you Kasha ",

Kasha is professional and kind. She made the acceptance criteria clear and was certain to reach out promptly if more information was required for approval. After approval I was given a move in date. Maintenance efficiently turned my unit and I moved in on schedule. Maintenance clearly takes pride in their work and it was obvious that they paid attention to the details while turning my unit. The cleaner also left my unit spotless.\n\nDo your research on the area so you understand and are comfortable in your new neighborhood. Overall I am completely satisfied with Sunset Pond Apartments, excited to live here, enjoy the amazing amenities, and pleased to work with Sunset Pond staff!",

Didn't seem to be any consequences because of how often it happened. Loud all the time, had my car broken into, and bike stolen here. Parking sometimes wasn't guaranteed because cars had been abandoned there for months. Paying rent in out dated inconvenient ways, with only check or money order. Better off anywhere I promise you. 2 stars because you can sign a month to month lease, letting you move out as soon as you can.",

Management was hostile and I have evidence of them lying and charging me wrong multiple times. They did not care about me being harassed by my neighbors, did not care that my toilet overflowed everytime the neighbors did laundry, did not care when there was standing water in my kitchen, did not care when my property was stolen off my porch or my car windows bashed in. There's always trash all over the parking lot, they raise rent every few months, post office even told me they won't deliver packages to this location because they got in an argument with the office.... not shocking.\nWhen I moved out of here my life improved tenfold. Do not sign a lease here, I promise you it is not worth it and your health will suffer- and don't believe the obviously fake bought reviews all saying this is a magical place. No one who lived here and has dealt with the property manager would ever honestly say that.",

Just today we arranged a schedule around an alleged water shut off that we got last minute notice about. It turns out the notice was posted to the wrong building, but no one on the office staff bothered to walk a block and let folks know about the mistake.\nThat is the kind of utterly atrocious customer service I have come to expect from the office staff. They won't tell me who their managers are so I am resorting to posting this publicly.\nOnce again, I think the apartments are fine, the maintenance staff are amazing, but unfortunately if you're looking you can probably do better. (or maybe the apartment market in Bellingham is tight enough that you are willing to deal with a lot of nonsense from ownership and their office employees, if so, I look forward to meeting new friendly neighbors, there's a lot of great folks here and if you play your cards right you rarely have to interact with the office folks.)\n\nIt's entirely possible that the office staff is over stressed in a difficult job, but once I called to complain about not getting advance notice for a water shut off and the office employee said \"f*** you\" and hung up the phone.\n\nThat's what you're getting yourself into if you move here, but again, great maintenance staff if you can successfully get the office to take down a maintenance request, which to be fair they do somewhat accurately about two thirds of the time.\n\nThis might be a two and a half star review but I'm rounding down to let prospective renters know about this major issue.",

If you can avoid leasing/renting here, do yourself the favor of paying the extra hundred somewhere far away from here in a safer/cleaner environment. I definitely learned my lesson.\n\nThe first year of living here, I experienced MANY random knocks at my door in the middle of the night when Im by myself leading me to have full panic attacks. My family that lives 10minutes away would have to come over @3am to check up on me. How can I not feel safe in my very own home??\n\nMy brand new 2020 car was hit in my very own designated parking space. (Mind you I was given the worst parking space here; by the entry way into the gravel parking lot where theres a big pothole and dumpster where all the homeless people dumpster dive 24/7) I asked for them to please help with my police report by sending in footage which was asked of me and not once did Janice or Kasha help me nor reach back out to let me know that they did.\n\nI started parking my car out in the gravel to avoid this situation again but the amount of homeless people that hangout in that lot with their broken down cars makes me feel incredibly unsafe as a women. One night my 16 year old brother was chased after in his truck by them and he called me freaking out not knowing what to do! Not to mention my sweet neighbors car was broken into recently and not Janice or kasha did anything about it!\n\nKasha confirmed they only have one camera that faces the gravel and it is very faint and hazy. Maybe you guys should get a better security system just in case something really bad happens? Just a thought you guys.\n\nSunset pond apartments, do better.",

Commonly noted issues include noise disturbances from neighboring units and tight parking spaces that can lead to vehicle damage. A couple of residents have reported difficulties with the office staff, describing interactions as unhelpful or unfriendly, which detracts from the overall experience.<br />Another recurring theme involves discrepancies with move-out procedures, as multiple reviews indicate residents were charged excessive and unjustified fees during the move-out, despite efforts to leave the unit in good condition. Additionally, the presence of homeless individuals and associated safety concerns near the complex have been significant pain points for some tenants, with reports of break-ins and thefts adding to the sense of insecurity. These challenges have led several past tenants to express disappointment and frustration in their reviews.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most concerning reviews for Sunset Pond Apartments paint a troubling picture of management's alleged misconduct and lack of accountability. Numerous tenants have accused management of unethical practices, such as retaining security deposits without valid reasons and making false claims about unit conditions during move-out. One reviewer noted being charged for water damage despite previous maintenance issues going unaddressed, while another recounted paying bills for errors that weren't their responsibility under the threat of eviction.<br />In some instances, residents described feeling unsafe due to an ongoing issue with nearby homeless individuals and the property management's apparent indifference towards solving such problems. Reports of unresponsive management when dealing with incidents like car vandalism further exacerbate this feeling of neglect. A few reviewers expressed that the hostile behavior and broken promises from management left them feeling exploited and bitter about their experience, clearly impacting their perception of the complex negatively.</p></section>"
