        "review": "I have been a tenant at Forest Park Apts for over 20 years.  I have never paid my rent late except for this month - I was 2 days late because I simply forgot.  They put a late notice on my door for the rent plus a $50 late fee.  I immediately went to the office and dropped off my check and a letter indicating that I didn't believe I deserved to pay the late fee considering my record and long tenancy.  Royce Group sent me a letter stating I still owed $50 so I called them (Michelle Saab) thinking that perhaps they didn't get my letter begging off the late fee.  That was not the case.  She did get my letter but didn't care.  She said 30 other people were late, too.  I replied that I know for a fact no one has lived there longer than me - not even close - and that maybe I should consider giving my notice.  Her reply was \"okay.\"  \n\nA Complete lack of respect and loyalty to a very long time tenant that has never paid rent late!  Really??\n\n\nSHAME ON YOU!!",
