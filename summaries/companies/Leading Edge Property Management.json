This article delves into the different sentiments that users express in their reviews, providing a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance. The intent of this article is to serve as a tool for those seeking a property management company or rental property, and not as an endorsement or critique of the company itself.

Some users reported disregard for maintenance concerns, notably citing instances where problems were left unresolved, which led to a sense of neglect. For those affected, this negligence overshadowed the generally proficient service demonstrated by the company.\n\nAdditionally, challenges in communication have caused frustration among some clients. Reviews point to experiences where attempts to reach the company went unanswered, leading to prolonged durations in which concerns were not addressed. For a company that often gets high marks for responsiveness and communication, these incidents are particularly jarring for the users involved.\n\n## Ugly\n\nThe most severe criticisms revolve around potential financial disputes and procedural discontent.

Such actions, if true, represent the uglier side of property management, where the balance of power between tenant and management company can seem skewed in favor of the latter.\n\nIn conclusion, while Leading Edge Property Management has garnered commendation for its customer service and professionalism, it is not without its detractors. It's important for prospective clients to consider these aspects carefully.
