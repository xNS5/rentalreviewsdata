        "review": "I was a resident of the Foothills property for 3 years, during which I had many unfortunate interactions with the Royce Group management. I was targeted for a few dead plants at the end of season while allowing other properties to look disorderly with no resolution. I believe this was largely based on my age (in my 60s). They aggressively targeted me for things that were not even my property without asking like a civilized adult. They assumed that a TV left in the parking area was mine and threatened to fine me for its disposal. At the time, I didnt even own a TV.\nThey Impounded my car and lied about it. Despite knowing exactly where I lived, they placed a sticker on my car facing away from where it would be easily noticeable over the weekend. When confronted they said that it was towed because it was inoperable (a lie as I had driven it out of impound). They then tried to lie saying it was because the tabs were expired (also NOT the case). They did not make any attempt to call me, knock on my door, or show any good faith attempt to resolve the issue before towing. Only reason I did not sue was because my daughter found a technicality in the lease stating that they could do that if the vehicle had any disrepair ( one of my windows did not roll up all the way and my bumper had some tape on it). All of this while allowing multiple other vehicles to remain on the property without having been moved for months. This was definitely an act of aggression based on impoverished appearances. They show disdain for people of lower income. Despite that, they themselves do not keep up their own property.\nFailure to light pathways caused me to fall showing that they did not care about the safety of their tenants  as well as car damaging pot holes that they were informed of multiple times and did nothing for the entire duration of my tenancy. They continuously raised the rent despite not investing it in making their property a nice place to live for the price. They also offered a swimming pool in their advertisement which remained empty for the majority of my tenancy then was filled in with dirt (false advertising amenities). The maintenance staff were incredibly courteous and went out of their way to help. They deserve more professional employers. The dwelling itself was alright, nice storage. The place has a lot of potential to be very nice if it werent for the deplorable behaviors of their management team.",

        "review": "I have a good friend who has lived at the Foothills for 10 years. She is nearly 70 years old and has a 34 year old mentally ill son she cares for 24 hours a day. He has schizophrenia and sometimes talks out loud to the voices in his head. He is a sweet young man when stabilized and totally harmless. A new neighbor heard him carrying on a conversation with himself and got frightened. She complained to the office and they are now in the process of being evicted.\nLast October, her upstairs hot water heater exploded and flooded the upstairs bathroom and the kitchen on lower level. There is no flooring or sink in upstairs bathroom, and no kitchen sink, cupboards, or counter in the kitchen. They provided her a small wash basin to do dishes. She has continued to pay rent and continued living in these terrible conditions for 5 months.\nShe is soon to be homeless, as she can not find a place to rent. This entire situation is atrocious and should be illegal.",

        "review": "The foothills apartments give me dirty crack den vibes. I've been living here for the past year with my significant other and we're ACTIVELY trying to find anywhere else to live but what I can call the lowest end dumps in the deepest depths of hell itself. We pay 915 for a one bedroom but come a few months from now, our place will be 1050 a month. We have walls so thin I doubt paper would be a good analogy for how gaunt the walls are. We don't have any sort of dishwasher in our place and we have disruptive neighbors who play piano at odd hours and take long noisy showers also at odd hours. Our bedroom and living room will be freezing cold if we don't keep our heaters on at all hours of the day, that jacks up our electric bill quite a bit as well. The pot holes are atrocious and I'm sure they keep f'ing up the brakes of our vehicle. They claim to have a swimming pool but it's always covered and actually FILLED WITH DIRT. So, they lie, we have a leak in the ceiling and I have called the royce group about it but they haven't called back or tried to send a maintenance guy over to patch it up. The water here goes cold within minutes so you better like taking speedy showers. Oh, and our power just shuts off because the breakers get overloaded by a lamp. Most of the switches and outlets are dead in our apartment so getting things to power up is scarce to say the least. They also overcharged us to move in. 915 a month for rent but I paid nearly 3200 bucks to get a place here. Quite a rip-off and I'm concerned I'll be not able to move out since I'm straddling the poverty line. I cannot recommend these dirt bags to anyone. Hope I don't get evicted for this review!",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>The allure of Foothills Apartments lies in its potential, as suggested by some user reviews. A number of tenants appreciate the courtesy and efforts of the maintenance staff, who are noted to go out of their way to assist residents. This contributes to a feeling that, despite other issues, there are elements of the property that are maintained with care and attention. Additionally, certain residents have commented on positive aspects of the apartments themselves, such as \"nice storage\" and a perceived elegance in some of the units.</p><p>From the feedback gathered, it is apparent that some long-term tenants have found solace at Foothills Apartments. These tenants have highlighted the tranquility of the environment, which could imply that there are areas or moments when living at Foothills is a peaceful experience. Furthermore, specific remarks about friendly neighbors and the allowance of pets suggest that there is a sense of community and accommodation for animal lovers.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>It appears there are no sufficient positive reviews that provide detailed experiences meeting the criteria for a 'great' category in this article. Consequently, this area cannot be thoroughly elaborated upon based on the available data from user reviews. The reviews that are somewhat favorable generally fall into the 'good' rather than 'great' category, with no standout examples of excellence in service or management to report.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>There are numerous accounts from users expressing dissatisfaction with the management's handling of the property. Residents have faced aggressive approaches from management regarding maintenance issues, such as being wrongly targeted for problems not of their making, and have described an attitude of disdain towards them. Furthermore, there have been complaints about the inconsistency in enforcing rules, with some tenants feeling singled out, suggesting a lack and fairness in management practices.</p><p>A reoccurring theme from user reviews is the steep and continuous rent increases despite a perceived lack of investment in property maintenance and amenities. Residents have reported a depreciating value for their money as the rent escalates, highlighting amenities like a swimming pool that remained unused or converted into something else, contradicting the property's advertising. Such discrepancies indicate a disconnect between the costs and the living standards provided to tenants.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Tenants have shared alarming incidents which raise serious concerns about safety and security at Foothills Apartments. The alarming frequency of vehicle theft and vandalism within the premises, including hit and runs and keyed cars, reflects a significant issue that has left residents feeling vulnerable. In one harrowing account, the lack of timely maintenance response led to a tenant enduring terrible living conditions for months following an incident of water damage.</p><p>Dire experiences shared by tenants, such as neglected pathways resulting in falls and vehicles towed without proper notification, reveal an environment fraught with disregard for tenant welfare. Moreover, the eviction of elderly tenants over misunderstandings and strict adherence to policy without compassion contributes to a narrative of management that is seen as insensitive and ruthless, prioritizing rules over humanity. Such scenarios have painted a picture of an unfriendly and discriminatory atmosphere at Foothills Apartments.</p></section>"
