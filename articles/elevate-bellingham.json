        "review": "I unfortunately lived here for 1 whole school year, and boy did I encounter a ton of interesting things.\n\nPros: Maintenance crew. These guys are the only thing keeping this place afloat, and they dont even have that large of a team, quick responses to tickets for apartment issues when I sent items in (bulbs out or closet off the tracks).\n\nCons: Lack of security, Managers, front hosts, price\n\nSecurity: Not only did I encounter a homeless man passed out in the stairwell when going in for a morning final, I had my car vandalized within the garage of this complex, as well as encountered a trespasser at 4am lurking around my floor looking for unlocked rooms. I too came across someones back car window smashed out and items stolen within (premium parking spot, 2nd floor garage).\n\nThe garage is a hotspot for sketchy things to happen, and this all stems from the company being too cheap to install a gate, the maintenance team recommended this a while back, but the company refused it due to the cost.\n\nManagers: I dont understand how these people still have jobs, they sit at their desk for 8 hours managing the front hosts, and dont do anything useful, theyre not lenient in re-scheduling room checks for people out of town for holidays, theyre not useful in managing noise complaints against other rooms, and from previous posts it also seems as if they cant even get security deposits back to people within a timely manner.\n\nFront hosts - I understand they are college students, so theres only so much they can do with their useless managers, so again not much complaints for them, rather how they are managed. They respond quick to noise complaint responses via text within working hours, but those complaints werent of any help as the I continued to send complaints over (manager not taking action). But apart from that, they are helpful over the phone with questions and helpful when filling out paperwork.\n\nPrice: The apartment price doesnt come with the cost of the monthly garage price; and for the cost of this place, it wasnt worth it. The room itself you pay for an internet router that is on the ceiling, a lack luster living room that is furnished, skimpy drawers for your room and a rock solid prison bed. Not to mention the jail like courtyard that no one ever used.\n\nAll in all, this place is at best a 2/5, for location to campus and the maintenance staff. I would stay away if you can, there are plenty of other better spots around (New England apartments for example). This company will soon go under, it seems like their owner is also running his other locations as poorly as this one in other states, which makes sense as to why the onsite managers are as useless as they are. Unfortunately the maintenance team isnt getting the resources they need in order to keep this place afloat. As for what we are paying, they should have plenty of funds to manage their costs and upkeep, but the owner is losing money, so hes cutting his spending unfortunately. Spend your money on a house or other well managed properties if you can, if this happens to be your last resort, just expect to encounter what Ive written out.",

Things that they don't do: fix the security cameras, fix broken locks, have functioning handicap accessibility buttons, clean up the broken glass from the several cars that have been broken into, clean up the puke that has been in the parking garage for over a month now, respect their tenants. Do not live here unless it is a LAST RESORT",

        "review": "Pros:\nPretty solid apartments. Pricey, but all the appliances are good quality and function well. Nice amenities, including an awesome top-floor deck overlooking downtown, full gym, and study lounge. Close proximity to both campus and downtown is a huge plus. Maintenance staff are fantastic and fixed every issue my roommates and I had within a few hours usually.\n\nCons:\nIn the 3 years I lived here, though, I found there to be an overabundance of irritating, immature people living here. If you live here, be prepared for a fair amount of noise and to be surrounded with people who don't care about others and vandalize exit signs, handrails, floor signs, and all manner of other things. This isn't necessarily the fault of the complex, but it's something to know if you decide to live here. They don't empty the trash room on the 3rd floor enough either, so it was disgusting and overflowing much of the time. Also, because it's on a major road to downtown in a college town, be prepared to hear a lot of loud cars, trucks and motorbikes with modified exhausts. Internet speeds are decent (25mbps down and up), but stability is questionable.\n\nOverall, I don't regret living here, and while I can't say how it compares to other apartments in Bellingham (I only lived in the dorms my first year and here my other 3), it's solid if you're willing to spend a lot. It seems like Elevate gets a lot of hate, and I don't think most of it is justified.",

I wish they vacuumed and maintained the fitness equipment like their yoga balls, basic cleanliness, and replace broken equipment (like the punching bag). The staff is very friendly and have fun activities for their residents. Maintenance requests are dealt with in a timely manner.

        "review": "This is my second year living at Elevate and I've renewed my lease for next year. I love living here! When I first visited, Corbin gave me a great tour and from there the application process was easy and the employees were very helpful and kind. I feel safe living here as there is a key fob system so the keys can't be copied and there are locks on nearly every door in the whole building. The facility is always clean and the staff members who fill maintenance requests are always very friendly and helpful. The apartments are spacious and the windows are nice and large. Elevate is pet friendly too, so having a cat has been very easy. Elevate also does a lot of awesome events and giveaways and they offer free printing (you just have to bring paper). The apartment is the perfect distance from the WWU campus- it usually takes me about 5-10 minutes to walk to campus. Overall I would highly recommend Elevate!",

However, the Elevate Bellingham property management wasnt necessarily the bad guy in this case and were very communicative and were mostly just the middleman to get stuff done right.\nThe issue lies with the management company and their tardiness and lax behavior towards getting people the deposit they are owed. After a whole year of communication I can confirm that Veronica, the community manager, was nothing but kind and helpful and truly wanted to right the wrongs that management was doing. Im not saying what they did isnt bad, but from a property level Elevate did all they could to help.",

The place is always kept very clean, all problems addressed immediately, things that do break are fixed within the same day.\n\nFree coffee available, very secure and safe building, parking is great with cameras all over the place and the overall cost is very reasonable for what you get. Not to mention the great huge, yet cozy, study room with Macs and desktops.\n\nThe only downside is the architecture is reminiscent of Soviet Era Brutalism - I think it's great but other people might find it dreary.

        "review": "Apartment itself looks nice, but appliances and furniture are generally pretty cheap. My friends referred to my couch as the \"hospital couch\" because it is so stiff and plastic like, and our refrigerator when we moved in had dents all over it from previous tenants that Elevate chose to leave as-is. Walls are covered in the thinest layer of paint ever, meaning if you so much as bump into a wall it leaves giant black marks, and the walls themselves are so thin you can hear basically all noise including your neighboring units through them.\n\nMy biggest problem with this company is the fact that they have not returned my security deposit to me after countless phone calls and over 3 months since moving out. When I told them that they had broken their contract by not returning this to me within 30 days they said there was nothing they could do about it and that they were understaffed, which is absolutely not an excuse to break their end of a contract that THEY created! Elevate also forced one of my roommates to move all of her things and switch rooms because of an error they had made in filling paperwork on which room she was living in. Instead of allowing her to keep her room because of their mistake, they comped her rent by $5 a month and said, \"consider this a free coffee on us every month!\" All of this is insanely unprofessional and unethical behavior on the part of Nelson Partners.\n\nUpdate: 9 months now and have still not received my deposit.

They advertise free coffee, cereal, and free printing, but the coffee was only free one day a week, the cereal jars always empty, and printer broken and never had any paper in it. Easier to just print on campus. When I finally was able to move out, they charged me $200 for carpet repair. I sent a total of 14 different emails asking to see a photo of what needed to be repaired in my room, but never got a response, only an email warning me that there would be late fees if I didnt pay the $200 repair fee soon. Dont live here, theres much better student housing available in Bellingham",

Management is always confused and never on the same page; they will also try to take every dollar they can from you at every turn. They are way overpriced, make promises they don't keep, and the building itself (as well as the individual units) is shoddily built. Twice in a 4 month period there was massive flooding that resulted in several floors being soaked and residents having to evacuate.",

We were coming from a unique position and from all over the place and she assisted with the application process and helped us get everything in order from long distances. The rent is not a huge burden, it is relatively inexpensive. However the office hours are minimal and very select on when they are in the office. The rooms are not bad, however even with on site maintenance because of their limited office hours you have to go through a separate office to put in work orders half the time. But like the title says, they are nice for what you pay. Other good qualities of the property is that is pretty well located just a few miles from a lot of things, and just outside the complex is a bus stop as well as a school, so the neighborhood itself is really not that bad.",

I went in to grab a package from the front desk and was asked in a rude and uninterested tone, do you need anything or.... Seemed as if my precense was a nuisance to them. Not the way to go about running a business. My roomate has had numerous encounters with the uninterested and rather unknowledgeable staff. Incredibly rude and uncaring towards her situations. I would not recommend this place to anyone at the moment. These are strong words I know, but as someone whos worked in retail for many years I understand the importance of customer service. I also believe in giving the benefit of the doubt, however this place has disappointed me and others too many times to count.\nAs far as other important things to note: appliances are subpar. Our dishwasher didnt really work well, just seemed to be cheap.  Water wasnt clean when we moved in. You need a key for every single floor (which can be an issue). Printer in the study lounge never worked and there was also never ink. Free amenities were never restocked or refilled (coffee and cereal).\nThis place has potential but until changes are made to staff I dont see this place succeeding because students are not the companys first interest.",

Most amenities were not available while I lived here, there was no change to rent and the company withdrew their offer for reduced rent with proof of good grades. The staff seems to do their best but were ill-equipped for the maintenance necessary for the building. The only elevator to the non-reserved parking garage is frequently in disrepair including on move-in day, forcing residents to walk up 3-7 flights of stairs to access their apartment (folks with ability impairments too!) Neighbors within the building are often inconsiderate in 3 ways: 1) noise penetrates the walls, floor and ceiling so there is potential disruption from any and all directions making studying from home a challenge. 2) messes in the trash room, hallway, parking garage and other common areas are constant. The 6th floor entrance is frequently soaked in dog urine. 3) many residents (and staff) don't follow COVID guidelines regarding large gatherings and wearing masks.

        "review": "Ok folks so if you dont read anything read this: DO NOT LIVE HERE. ITS A SAFETY HAZARD\n\n1) so youd expect your apartment to at least have something like...gee I dunno, a lock on your front door? Well that apparently sets the bar too high for this apartment complex. The first 2 weeks we lived here we didnt have a lock on our front door. We had a lock that wouldnt read our keys and malfunctioned and gathers response? We will get it fixed when we can we waited 2 weeks and got a lock that didnt even LOCK. I could stick my fingernail in it and it would unlock it was so flimsy. When we asked for a lock that had a key reader we did not receive one until about 6-7 months into our lease. And when we FINALLY received one they changed the locks without telling us, so I couldnt get into the apartment and had to spend 3 hours in their office explaining to them the situation and missed a work shift because I couldnt get into MY apartment.\n\n1.5) (locks continues) the doors work on a double locking system. So you need a key to get out. So if you forget your keys youre screwed. My friend forgot her keys and her phone died as she was going down to get her laptop out of her car to turn in an assignment. SHE WAS TRAPPED IN A STAIRWELL FROM MIDNIGHT TO 6AM because her phone died and she couldnt get out. Need I say more? Gather is a safety hazard\n\n2) the elevators just shut down or randomly undergo maintenance at a moments notice so if you have a disability that makes stairs difficult maybe dont live here. And even IF you are on the first floor where there are ADA accessible ramps, forget about access buttons on the doors. But lets just say you CAN get through the doors. Each apartment is set up totally randomly so the chances that the hallways or bathrooms are set up correctly for you is like zero to none.\n\n3) gather Bellingham promises many amenities that they dont deliver. They provide their own internet which, yes, will randomly kick you off your connection and even with your resident log in sometimes it DOESNT WORK! And free coffee, isnt free. Free printing isnt free and he printer doesnt work. Free cereal, well they dont ever stock the study room with cereal so its free but nonexistent for the past 4 months. The gym? Not as good as westerns. The TV package, you could get one of way better. For 675-800 a month just go pay rent at a house and pay for all these amentiriws yourself and pay like 600 a month for THE SAME STUFF.\n\n4) the staff is either totally clueless or totally rude. I dont blame the students who work here, theyre in over their head and there is poor management. They just simply dont know how to answer tough questions because they werent trained on HOW to. The upper management Ive dealt with has been incredibly rude. When I asked them to replace the lock on our door they said that would be nice. NO IT WOULDNT BE NICE ITS THEIR FREAKING JOB TO PROVIDE US WIH A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE\n\n5) and while Im on safety. This is located on the 900 block. If anyone is familiar with this block you will be familiar with the 30+ western alerts throughout the year about car break-ins, people mastrabuating in the windows, flashing people, etc.\n\n6) the furniture they give you is super crappy and cheap. Not to mention they didnt even bother to paint or seal the drywall??\n\n7) speaking of drywall WHEN WE MOVED IN THERE WAS DRYWALL IN THE WATER. we had giant white chunks floating in our water and had to get a filter. Again when we approached management they said oh that should stop in a few days. Great. So no locks, no clean water, Id be better off sleeping in my hammock in the arb and taking showers in the sink at western because at least the water wouldnt be toxic and Id have the same amount of security\n\nTLDR; Gather is a money grabbing, safety hazard that wont put locks on your doors, will trap you in a stairwell, and has hazardous water with expensive amentiites that dont work. Youre better off living at a hammer property (and thats saying something) that or live with a private landlord and save $150+",

They advertise all of these incredible amenities with pictures of clean, modern furniture and attractive 20 somethings smiling and holding skateboards or coffee; but they dont deliver. In fact, they straight up lie sometimes. In each lease, lessees are promised a pool, hot tub, and tanning salon. Guess what Gather doesnt have. Yep! No pool or anything else to be found! They advertise free coffee and cereal in the study room too. So, lets start with the study room.\nCoffee is only free if you are getting regular. They used to have other drinks like lattes and mochas and espresso also free, but I guess even when youre taking wads of cash from all of your residents, you sometimes cant afford to pay for things that you promise them. The cereal only gets restocked on the first three days of the workweek, so good luck if youre trying to get a bowl on the weekend. It will be long gone by then. Free printing isnt free either. You have to bring your own paper and just hope that theres ink in the printer (theres usually not). And this is all just in the main study room! In the other, smaller study rooms on most other floors youll find nothing. Yep, nothing. For almost 6 months, Gather Bellingham has had signs on the doors saying study room: coming soon. As residents, we pay for the amenities we were promised, and to still not have study rooms furnished and set up isnt just irresponsible, it shows that Gather Bellingham only cares about getting you to sign the lease. Once youve done that, theyre not trying to impress you anymore. Dont get me wrong, most of the employees are friendly and as helpful as they can be. But it seems that most of them are unprepared and uninformed, and frankly, theyre in over their heads. I dont know who in the chain of command is responsible for this, but its obvious that someone doesnt care about Gather Bellingham. They dont care about the residents, they dont care about keeping their word, and they dont care if their employees are left out to dry. They are only concerned with getting you in the door. And, while were on the topic of doors, it would probably be a good time to mention another place where Gather falls short.\nDoors. The doors in Gather are a nightmare. The doors in Gather are like if they were installed by someone who is obsessed with security, but who also has no idea how to actually make something secure. To get into a stairwell, you can just walk on in. But to get out, you need a key. You cannot exit a stairwell without one. So, if theres ever a fire lets just hope that you remembered to grab your keys before fleeing a burning building! They also have key readers that activate the elevators, but only at certain floors. The basement, first, and second floors have key readers on the elevators there, as does the elevator closest to the skybridge entrance on the 6th floor. These are all places where people would be arriving at the elevator from the outside. So to dissuade non-residents sneaking in, they made these elevator entrances only accessible by key. Except they did it in a way that makes no sense. Seriously, youd have to see it to believe it. And they didnt even make the building any safer. If you get in through the skybridge and make it to the keyed elevator and find yourself without a key, fear not! You can always just walk down the hall to the other elevator that doesnt require a key from that floor. Safe and sensible, right? And to put the cherry on top, sometimes your key just wont work. The key reader simply wont accept it and you cannot get into whatever door or elevator you were trying to unlock. Gathers response to this? Just have someone with you whenever you need to go through a locked door! Because you always have a buddy with you when youre coming home from class, or work, or going down to check your mail, right?\n\nalso:\nbreak ins\ncourtyard restrictions\nfines everywhere",

          "text": "Hi John,\n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to write this, and I sincerely apologize that your experience with Gather has led you to writing such a review. We work hard to ensure that our residents have only the best experience with us.\n\nI want to address some of your comments.\n- You will never need a key to get out of the stairwell. I encourage you to see for yourself by going into our stairwell and then walking to the bottom floor, where you should go in case of a fire. The entrances to the stairwell from the outside are locked from the outside. We only lock the stairwells from the inside on the residential floors to help make sure only those who live here have access to residents' rooms. Many of our residents are happy with this added feature.\n- We pride ourselves in offering free drip coffee and free cereal to our residents.\n- I encourage you to research what was advertised and what our lease promises residents will receive, as I assure you that we have not misled our residents in any way from when they signed a lease back in the leasing office until they moved in.\n- In regards to printing, we don't charge for printing. You may still incur an additional cost by purchasing paper. We do know our printer has some issues every now and then, and we try to respond to those issues as quickly as possible. In those instances, we are happy to provide free printing in the leasing office. All you'll need to do is email us the document you need to print, and we'll be happy to get that printed for you.\n- If you notice that one of our locks aren't working, we can usually have it repaired within a minute or two so long as it is reported to us, so we hope you can be an active member of our community and alert Gather Staff when these things happen so we can repair them. (We do see Google reviews, but not as immediately as we do friendly faces, and this doesn't help us know which lock is malfunctioning).\n\nPlease feel free to reach us directly at (360)474-7845. I know you left this review anonymously, and we can certainly appreciate that desire, but rest assured we will work hard to help you in anyway we can should you give us a call or come into the office in need.\n\nThank you again, and have a wonderful day!"

Cheaper than WWU housing by roughly $30 depending on your circumstances. What more could I say?\n\nMost important thing is Gather Bellingham has secure bike rooms.

When compared, our pricing is very similar to the annual cost of living in the dorms. However, in addition at Gather you get the benefit of living in a Brand New apartment complex with several state-of-the-art amenities and the luxury of having a private bedroom and private bathroom option. Due to our close proximity to WWU campus and downtown Bellingham, our prices are comparative, and lower in cases, than those in the surrounding areas. For the students at WWU and residents of Bellingham who live at Gather our top priority is to provide them with exceptional customer service, a truly outstanding product, and a place that they are proud to call home. We hope that you'll give us a chance to showcase that by choosing to live at Gather."

        "review": "Please read the following post before renting an apartment at The Elevate.\n\nMy son has lived here for a couple of years now.  Recently, the batteries went dead on the electronic lock on his door so he was unable to lock his door.  He notified the management that he could not secure his apartment (studio) and that he was basically stuck at home there until maintenance could fix his door lock.\n\nThe management sent the maintenance guy down who told him that they could change the batteries out but didn't have the computer program to re-program the locks (computers with program on them stolen evidently) so his apartment would remain unlockable.  This was on a Thursday.  My son went back on Friday.  No resolution, no plan, no repair just lots of excuses to not repair door.  No urgency, no apparent desire to solve the problem before the weekend. Entire weekend then stuck in an unlockable apartment.  My son missed his weekend at work because he could not lock his door and leave and subsequently missed out on a couple hundred dollars of pay.\n\nMonday, same song and dance.  Run around from management.  Calls to regional manager who wouldn't answer phone and apparently would not authorize the placement of a simple mechanical lock on the door. \n\nOn Tuesday I got involved and called asking to talk to the manager.  She was pleasant but said her hands were tied.  I requested to talk to regional manager and got his number.  Based out of Arizona, he would not answer my calls or return my calls.  Several attempts but no contact and zero customer service.  I asked the building manager if they could at least put a standard mechanical lock on the door so he could lock his apartment and attend class. More run around, no resolution.\n\nFinally on Wednesday, we heard they were going to fix the lock sometime between 10am and 2pm.  My son went to class expecting the problem to be resolved.  Came back from class-door lock still broken.\n\nThursday, one week from door lock problem the maintenance guy came back out and put a mechanical door lock on his door which is what should have been done on day one. \n\nSo, what is your time worth?  What value do you put on expecting that your apartment is going to be lockable and secure?  What value do you put on your belongings?  Your computer and personal items?  What does it feel like to be sequestered in your room because the management would not authorize a door lock for your apartment? (a really simple and inexpensive fix)  What kind of obligation do you feel toward your employer and the job that you have?  What dollar value do you think this should impact rent?\n\nPlease remember that Elevate is a private for profit business that recognizes that students are transitory and likely will only live there for a year or two.\nTaking care of their residents does not appear to be a priority in any shape or form.  Please take this into consideration before renting an apartment here.\n\nDoug S",

        "review": "For one bedroom in an apartment with 3 other roommates the cost is too high. Most amenities were not available while I lived here, there was no change to rent and the company withdrew their offer for reduced rent with proof of good grades. \nThe staff seems to do their best but were ill-equipped for the maintenance necessary for the building. The only elevator to the non-reserved parking garage is frequently in disrepair including on move-in day, forcing residents to walk up 3-7 flights of stairs to access their apartment (folks with ability impairments too!) \nNeighbors within the building are often inconsiderate in 3 ways: 1) noise penetrates the walls, floor and ceiling so there is potential disruption from any and all directions making studying from home a challenge. 2) messes in the trash room, hallway, parking garage and other common areas are constant. The 6th floor entrance is frequently soaked in dog urine. 3) many residents (and staff) don't follow COVID guidelines regarding large gatherings and wearing masks. \nYes this apartment has conveniences but there are also many drawbacks.",

        "review": "Too expensive, especially considering they never fix anything. There has been a door into the mail room that has been broken for six months and they just haven't bothered to fix it. There was an alarm that was going off for about a week in the basement that I honestly don't know what was for but it wasn't life threatening so idk why they never shut it off. They also stopped sending notifications for when you get packages (which btw is annoying that the hours to pick them up are really limited) at one point without telling anyone they would and my roommate needed her meds but had to go a few days without them since she didn't know they were here... the trash room is always a disaster, the dishwasher is unreliable, and the vibe is like a hotel dorm situation. That being said dorms are usually more maintained. To be fair everyone that worked in the office quit on the same day so I can see why for a while the maintenance was worse than normal but then you have to question why everyone quit. Also the certification for the elevator expired, and it was down for a hot minute so not good for accessibility reasons AT ALL. This complex is located on a street that a ton of party houses are on so I hope you like noise and fireworks at 2am. Also just cars are loud and frequent. The walls are super thin though so everything is loud. \nNow I know covid made things difficult and that's fair, but the amenities were down for the majority of the time and they never did anything to make up for it (such as a refund for amenity fees as an example) \nIf you're thinking about moving to bham, especially as a student, just get a house, it's roughly half the cost per month if you can get some good roommates (and it's easier to avoid them in a house if they are bad so...)\nIt seemed like a good decision when we signed the lease, but that wasn't the case.  Covid did screw some stuff up and it probably would have been better without it and they might have gotten a higher rating from me, but they handled it poorly, it's like they gave up on everything, and they it really hard to get of the lease so I know people that never set foot in here and still paid full price the whole time. \nTLDR; they need to Elevate their standards",

She was going to move back to Oregon, and needed the deposit for another apt. They said it would get to her soon. We communicated with Veronica in the office weekly for awhile. She was always nice and answered our questions. The weeks turned into months, and still nothing. They would tell her to tell us it in was in the mail. The employees at Elevate were always nice and helpful, but management was not. We decided to take them to court at one year, and just served them papers. We were angry at how management brushed us off, and asked for what we thought was fair. It's the day before court day14 months later, and they agree today. Elevate was   not at fault in this matter and Veronica the office mgr. is a very nice person! It's just too bad we had to go that far just to get our money back.",

It is not an exhaustive report, and the sentiments and specific examples cited reflect only the opinions of individuals who wrote the reviews, without confirmation or endorsement of their claims. The purpose of this article is to serve as a tool for those seeking information about Elevate Bellingham and should not be the sole factor in making a decision regarding property management services.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Good</h2>    </heading>    <p>Several user reviews reveal areas where Elevate Bellingham property management excels. Tenants have praised the location for its proximity to campus and downtown, appreciating the convenience this offers. The quality of appliances within the apartments has also been complimented, suggesting that they function well and enhance the living experience. The property is known to host a variety of events and giveaways, creating a vibrant community atmosphere that many residents enjoy.</p>    <p>In addition to this, the maintenance staff receives significant adoration from tenants for their prompt and efficient handling of service requests. Whether it's quickly restoring power to a dishwasher, fixing garage disposal issues, or courteously interacting with residents, the maintenance crew is seen as an asset to the property and essential in maintaining its operability and appeal.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Great</h2>    </heading>    <p>The level of tenant engagement and the amenity offerings at Elevate Bellingham come across as notable positives in user reviews. Specifically, the fitness room, study lounges, and the top-floor deck with its panorama of downtown have been highlighted as standout features. The pet-friendly policy is also a boon for animal-loving residents, allowing for a more inclusive and homey environment.</p>    <p>Furthermore, some reviews applaud the quick turnaround times for maintenance requests, noting that the maintenance team excels at resolving issues effectively, with responses generally seen within the same day. The addition of certain amenities, such as well-lit areas for added security and the availability of furnished units, have also been cited, reflecting that the management responds to feedback and continuously works on improving the resident experience.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Bad</h2>    </heading>    <p>The bad aspects of Elevate Bellingham are well-documented in several user reviews, with a common theme being the delay in returning security deposits to former tenants. Reports suggest a tendency towards slow communications and a lack of urgency in processing these returns, leading to frustration and even legal action. Additionally, some reviewers mention that while the apartments look attractive, they are furnished with cheap materials, leaving residents dissatisfied with the quality, given the high cost of the rent.</p>    <p>Another problematic area is tenant security concerns, as some reviews recount experiences of cars being vandalized within the garage and trespassers on the property. This has led to a call for improvements in security measures, such as the installation of a gate, which the company has reportedly been reluctant to address due to cost considerations. Moreover, noise complaints and the handling of maintenance issues have also been cited as areas where the company's performance does not meet expectations.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Ugly</h2>    </heading>    <p>In the realm of the truly alarming, user reviews speak to instances of profoundly inadequate management practices at Elevate Bellingham. Disturbing accounts of management entering apartments without notice, violating lease terms, and not addressing crucial facility problems like broken security cameras and faulty locks add to the perception of oversight and neglect. Such disregard for standard property management protocols and resident privacy cast the company in a decidedly negative light.</p>    <p>To compound these issues, the property has faced ourtright accusations of audacious behavior\u2014ranging from extreme neglect that contributes to an unsafe living environment to exploiting legal loopholes at the residents' expense. The lack of basic cleanliness in certain communal areas, such as fitness rooms and hallways, not to mention the mismanagement of facilities and delayed maintenance, reflects a problematic disregard for tenant welfare. Overall, patterns of neglect, poor customer service, and failure to fulfill promised amenities contribute to a stressful and unsatisfactory living experience for numerous tenants.</p>  </section></article>"
