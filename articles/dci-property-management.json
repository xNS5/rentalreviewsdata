        "review": "I have absolutely loved my time as a tenant under DCI Properties! Kristen is great and easy to work with, a truly kind person, and she does an awesome job of remaining in communication with all of her tenants. The apartment I rented was outstanding, at a very reasonable price! In addition, her father (who does maintenance at the properties) is a really friendly guy and responds quickly to any issues that may arise. No negatives that I can think, and I highly recommend!",

When our dishwasher went out they acted immediately, professionally , and  in a very polite manner. I would highly recommend them to absolutely everyone. You seriously will not find a better property management company around. My wife and I both consider ourselves to be very fortunate and that we found this amazing home with a wonderful yard to rent through them. You absolutely will not be disappointed with their service.",

        "review": "Like many people who are new to Bellingham and need to rent an apartment, I went to searching online for available apartments and seeing what reviews there were. Across the board most the apartments had a plethora of unsolicited 5-star reviews, lots of 1-stars, with averages running about 3. This made it really frustrating and hard to apply to, or even consider renting there (5-star ratings w/no comments, which turned out to be some properties giving $100 off rent or something similar to those who leave 5-star review). Eventually I came across Cedar Grove by DCI Prop. Management. Their reviews were/are in the 4-star range and the comments were solid ,so that was promising.\nAny who, I decided to give them a try and got some information very promptly from Ta. Return emails were quick, informative, and helpful. I asked a lot of questions and she was patient with me during this. Ultimately I decided to sign with them!\nEverything was done online, which was great considering I was 6-hours away and limited time to go up during the week. On move-in day I got. called from them to see when I'd be coming by to get my keys which was nice.\nTLDR; Responsive, nice, patient, and easy process. 5/5 would recommend.\n\nApartment itself was brand new an",

Many user reviews highlight the responsiveness and professionalism of the property managers, with several tenants reporting exceptionally positive experiences with staff members like Kristen. Users appreciate her communication skills and her ability to address any issues swiftly, such as when a dishwasher malfunctioned; the company acted immediately and resolved the situation professionally.</p><p>The properties managed by DCI are noted for being well-maintained and reasonably priced, creating a sense of security and comfort for tenants. One user emphasized how well they were treated during their time at Cedar Grove, stating that it was the best rental management they had experienced in the area. Overall, high ratings reflect DCI's commitment to tenant satisfaction and effective property management.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Overall, the sentiment expressed in user reviews for DCI Property Management leans heavily towards the positive, with an average rating of 4.92 out of 5. Many tenants recount their experiences as being enjoyable, mentioning that DCI's staff is not only professional but also genuinely caring. For example, a business tenant reviewed their experience, praising the organization and stating that maintenance issues were always handled in a friendly and timely manner, which contributes to the strong reputation that DCI has built in Whatcom County.</p><pAdditionally, user reviews highlight the seamless and convenient rental process facilitated by DCI. New tenants have noted how easy it was to communicate with the management, even from afar, allowing for a smooth onboarding experience. These factors collectively illustrate DCI's strong customer service orientation and eagerness to foster a positive rental environment.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>While many reviews are overwhelmingly positive, there are some areas where DCI Property Management could improve. A few user reviews indicate a lack of engagement with certain tenants, particularly in the aftermath of maintenance requests. While most issues seem to be resolved quickly, there are some mentions of sporadic delays, which could be frustrating for residents wanting to maintain the quality of their living environment.</p><pMoreover, despite its high rating, there is an occasional call for clearer communication regarding property policies and other operational details. Some users have expressed confusion over the security deposit process and how it was managed, illustrating that while DCI excels in many areas, there remains some room for improvement in transparency and responsiveness to all renters.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pThere are few negative indicators to note for DCI Property Management as the majority of user reviews reflect a positive experience. However, a lack of diverse feedback from tenants indicates potential underreporting of experiences, as not all tenants choose to leave reviews. This can create a skewed perception of the property management company, as certain issues may not be publicly visible.</p><pAdditionally, a small number of reviews without detailed commentary can raise some concerns about the authenticity of experiences shared, suggesting that there might be underlying dissatisfaction that isn't captured. Nevertheless, the overall positive feedback suggests that, for most tenants, their experiences have largely been satisfactory or exceptional.</p></section>"
