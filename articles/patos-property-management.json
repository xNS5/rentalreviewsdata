        "review": "Dane is a super star property manager. We had to deal with a change of ownership during our lease term of the unit we were renting and were lucky the new owners chose Patos for managing the place. Dane is super communicative and helpful as we navigated that somewhat turbulent experience. For renters who are used to vulture-like management companies like Lakeway Realty, Patos Management feels like renting from a private landlord. Very personal and helpful and not trying to squeeze you for every penny they can. We had a great experience.",

The property I stayed at was wonderfully maintained and Dane was very involved in making improvements. It's clear how much he cares about his property and tenants. 5/5 experience! :)",

Dane was very accommodating and understanding of my situation as well given I didn't intend to stay for a year but allowed me to sigh a lease for 3 months.  Nice and clean property would recommend to others.",
