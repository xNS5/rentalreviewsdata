      "review": "When Liz Standow was recommended to us, it was said that, \"She is awesome person.\" That held true as she helped us navigate all the ins and outs of the home buying process.  As a first time home buyer, I appreciated her knowledge, as well as the time she took to explain everything to my wife and me (and sometimes even my daughter). She was very knowledgeable and earned our complete trust. My wife and I were pretty sure we wanted to buy the first house we looked at, which we ultimately did, but Liz made sure we looked at every other available option before putting in an offer which helped us understand the current market and know that we were getting the best house in our price range. She even drove my family and me around to get it done. She helped us negotiate and get a great deal on an awesome house. I highly recommend Liz to anyone looking to buy a home, first time or not.",
