        "review": "I have lived here for five and a half years.  Snow season means shovels and ice melt at every entrance.  The slopping drive way is shoveled as much as possible. Truely the management cares.  Mowed during the summer and pet friendly.  K & M live on site and hire tenants to work on projects.  It is my favorite place (don't move much) in the last 23 years.  Not a slum at all.  Storage may be available on-site. Quiet too.",

        "review": "I've lived in 4 of these apartments over the last 6.5 years and I have nothing but wonderful things to say. The apartment's themselves are big and very pet friendly. The apartment manager Karen is one of the best people I know and treats every tenant as if they were family- she has done so much for me over the years. I feel like these apartments are truly home.",

The People that run it are really awesome and friendly, and they can fix most things, so you don't have to wait forever for a service appointment! There is plenty of parking, and their pet policy is very reasonable. There is a nice clubhouse(pool and ping pong table) and workout room. The only thing that could make this place better is a bike rack.",

        "review": "Best apartment I've ever lived in. Excellent value, mucho convenient, especially if you're a Western student because it's right next to the park and ride so you'll always have a spot on the bus. Pet friendly! Mel and the whole team are awesome, even Canada Man-- all friendly, responsive, and helpful. Be sure to apply soon soon soon because it's so great they rarely have vacancy. Small drawbacks: freeway noise and the ceilings/floors are a little thin so don't apply if you're a partier.",

Not only that, but their pet policy is fantastic!  I can happily have all three of my cats with no problem and the deposit was very reasonable.  This has been my favorite complex to rent at ever!",

        "review": "Samish Ridge is hands down the best apartment complex I've ever lived at and by far the best in Bellingham! Leann and Kari are the greatest. Unfortunately we graduated and my fiance was offered a job opportunity back at home so we moved. We have had a hard time finding a place down at home that compares. This complex was pet friendly, the apartments are very clean, well maintained, spacious and affordable. The staff is beyond great, they're always available to talk to, the property grounds are well kept, quiet, and safe. We never once had an issue with our place and the only time we had a small maintenance request, it was handled within the hour. We also miss their workout area and club house. They have pool table, bowflex, three cardio machines and a sauna. Rarely did it ever get busy enough to wait for anything either.\n\nThe location is great, it's not too far from the University and in a great neighborhood where you're close enough to the city, but partying and noise had never been an issue. The complex is comprised of a pretty even mix of students and  working professionals. You're just about a 10 minute walk to Fred Meyer or to Haggen and the park 'n ride is right across the street, so you have plenty of options. This place is rarely vacant, as we were on a waiting list and referred by some friends before first living here. So take a look and if they have a vacancy, take it! You'll thank me later! :)",

        "review": "I previously lived here for about 2.5 years. I have lived several places since but this is absolutely the best apartment complex I have lived in to date. \n\nThe first thing is the management. Leann and Kari are awesome, awesome managers. Nice and friendly and respond to maintenance requests in record time. I never realized just how spoiled I was until I moved away.\n\nLocation, location, location. Super quiet complex away from the main campus student rentals. I lived here when I was attending WWU and it was great because it was literally a five minute walk to the park and ride. After I was out of school it was nice because it was super easy to get on the freeway to go to work - 1 minute drive to go north on I-5, less than 5 minutes to go south.\n\nThe apartments themselves are spacious and a great value for the price. I lived in both a two bedroom and a one bedroom and they were both huge! The one bedroom had the largest closet I have ever seen in an apartment, ever. The cabinets/carpet/flooring are all standard apartment fare, nothing special but really well maintained. Washer, dryer, dishwasher included. There's an exercise room in the main building and you can reserve common area in the main building for events.",

        "review": "If you're going to live in Bellingham, live at Samish Ridge. I cannot say enough good things about it.\n\nWe lived here for four years and they were wonderful. First off, the location is awesome. It's close to Haggen, Fred Meyer, Rite Aid, El Agave, Boomer's, and it's right next to the Park N Ride so it is beyond easy (and a short bus ride) to everywhere on Bill McDonald Pkwy and the WWU campus. We rarely used our car because Bellingham public transit is so great and Samish Ridge is right next to the Park N Ride.\n\nThe apartments themselves are clean and spacious. There is a fitness room that I used countless times, the area is beautiful for going on walks, and the manager is wonderful. Her name is Melanie, and she is incredibly kind and personable and responds to maintenance requests and questions very fast. \n\nThe complex is quiet - not a party zone for students like Indian St., and the rent is fair. Pets allowed AND washer/dryer in unit. Again, I can't say enough good things. The staff, the location, the apartments themselves - everything was superb. We loved living here and were sad to move out of the area.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Samish Ridge Apartments enjoys a stellar reputation for being welcoming and pet-friendly. Tenants have expressed appreciation for the area's upkeep during the snow season, with management providing shovels and maintaining the driveways for easy access. The user reviews also commend the summertime lawn care and the availability of on-site storage. Another remarkable highlight is the management's policy of hiring tenants for various projects, which could foster a strong sense of community and teamwork.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>A number of user reviews reflect exceedingly positive experiences with Samish Ridge Apartments, specifically praising the site management's personal touch. It seems that not only does the management treat residents like family, but they also are very hands-on and responsive to maintenance requests. The apartments themselves are described as spacious with a reasonable pet policy, allowing tenants to truly feel at home. It is evident from the reviews that the management's efficiency and affability greatly contribute to the high level of tenant satisfaction.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the overall excellent feedback, there is mention of some minor inconveniences at Samish Ridge Apartments. For instance, some reviews point out the issue of audible freeway noise, which could be a nuisance for residents seeking a quieter environment. Additionally, a few reviews note that the floors and ceilings might be on the thinner side, potentially causing an issue for those sensitive to noise from neighboring units. While these points are vastly outweighed by positive comments, they are still factors potential renters might want to consider when looking at Samish Ridge.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>From the data provided, there are no particularly 'ugly' aspects that stand out in the user reviews. In fact, it is somewhat rare not to find any scathing critiques or experiences of neglect from a property management company. This could indicate that Samish Ridge Apartments is fairly diligent in fulfilling their duties and maintaining a high standard of living for their tenants. However, in the absence of any negative reports, it\u2019s always wise for potential new renters to ensure they fully understand lease terms, policies and conduct a thorough walkthrough to ensure satisfaction before committing.</p></section>"
