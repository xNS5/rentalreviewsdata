        "review": "I had used this company since 2019. It's was a very bad property management company that you can not depend upon.It was tragic for me. The way they treat me and my tenants. We cannot get any respond from them when we need them. therefore they are all there for them self instead of taking care of your issue nor care for your property. My tenants has been rent my property for over two years and he fed up with it because of no reply or respond by the property manager when he needed help or some thing. He moved out of my property,sadly I got slapped with the bills of about $1000 on a touchup paint by Windemere management. I urge you not to use this company ,if you need  property management.take my words and so you will not be regret it. I thank you for reading your safety messages. That's all my concern.",

        "review": "I rented from a private owner (he rents several properties) beginning of 2019. June 2022, I filed a protection order against my ex. & was awarded the home. The owner attempted to evict daughter & I. I asserted my rights & the notice was rescinded. After filing a complaint w/ HUD, the owner hired Windermere to deal with the hysterical woman that I am. I was EXTREMELY hopeful as there had been harassment & retaliation from the owner. I received a letter on my door mid-August. Windermere took exactly 2 weeks to verify after numerous calls. It also said if we had paid Sept. to the owner, that was fine, which we had by this time. Also, that a walk-through inspection to be conducted & that if refused I will be charged $100.00. Personally, I try not to open with threats when I begin a relationship. At the inspection 9/6 I advised them that our refrigerator hadn't been working. When stated that its difficult eating out of a freezer, her comment was \"that's good, at least your freezer is working\". It did not. We were eating out of a chest freezer we had brought into the home. I assumed she wrote it down while taking notes when asking my daughter & I if there are any maintenance requests to be fixed. Nope. I had to email & voicemail, & deal with the owner & his hostile & belittling texts. Eventually after an educated repair person confirmed that it was no longer working, we received a refrigerator 10/13. As I had been a month-to-month tenant for over 3.5 years with zero rent increases promised and obliged at $1525.00 per month, Windermere decided to toss a new lease at me starting at $1600.00 effective immediately due Sept. rent that had already been paid. Included was another increase, now $1700.00 effective 1/1/2023. Then \"expectations\", my parents were more lenient w/ rules & regulations when I was a child. I advised I would not be signing the lease & wish to remain month to month. 1/31 I received notice with the threat of unlawful detainer if we're not gone by 4/30 as the owner intends to sell the home. I asked if the other person on the lease had been notified as his items were still on the property. I was told they do not see anyone else listed. I let them know there is a protection order in place so if they could please communicate that, I'd appreciate it. I am still waiting to hear back. Upon the overwhelming communication as to what MY responsibilities are in the move out, that is all that was heard. Windermere was notified of my departure and that my ex could gather his items and assist in the cleaning. As soon as possible they did the walk through and give me their opinion on how the place looked. I asked for a copy of the rent increase that went into effect in Sept. I STILL have yet to receive a response. After a couple of weeks, I reached out & was told everything had been removed from the house & it was in the process of being cleaned at the direction of the owner. My ex has every character trait of narcissistic personality disorder. His stuff was #1 priority in the meaning of life. Him leaving everything confirmed my suspicions. I am disappointed that it was not communicated to me. Whatever. I also was not surprised when told that he's in the process of having the protection order amended & the owner has written a new lease for him to move back into the home 4/1 at $1,600.00 a month. I think back to May of 2022 & how I was done with my relationship & done with being punished for having the wrong response or thoughts or feelings or actions, etc. I ultimately didn't care if I had to live in my car. THANK YOU, WINDERMERE,...FOR MAKING THAT DREAM COME TRUE :o) I apologize as I believe this to be the longest review written ever. Being how I have relocated; I have also lost access to my therapist. So, this will have to do for now. I wish I could say I'm extremely grateful for them reaching out and apologizing after the threats, eviction, being notified that the owner never truly intended to sell, and completely ignoring my rights as a survivor of domestic abuse. But I'm still waiting for them to get back to me.",

It doesn't matter if you are a perfect tenant in every way --- they just don't care about people. \n\nCustomer service is truly the worst I've ever experienced in any sort of environment. Not only do property managers/desk attendants avoid your as well as your calls and emails, they will conveniently \"forget\" you scheduled appointments and be unable to reschedule. They are rude to your face, via the phone and via email. \n\nMaintenance requests go unanswered for years. Yes -- I said years. They do absolutely the bare minimum for their clients and its truly stomach churning. I would recommend any property management company but Windermere.",

        "review": "I have quite the story to share with the public about Windermere Property Management of Bellingham. I would also highly recommend that you visit windermerewatch.com for more valuable information. \n\nMy boyfriend and myself signed a lease with Windermere on a place located in Ferndale back in July 2017. I had already been through several other local property management companies and had bad experiences with two others in simply applying for a place and by way of misrepresentation of properties and wasting time looking at them and or applying for them just to find out they were in really bad shape unlike the photos led one to believe. I was actually under the false impression that Windermere was a reputable business. Unfortunately that was FAR from the truth. \n\nOn July 1st we began moving our things to Ferndale, actually my boyfriend did as I was to be flying out of Sea-Tac the following morning at 7:00 am. I stayed back to pack and we left for Sea-Tac that afternoon as we had a hotel room so that I didn't have to be on the road in the middle of the night to drive there from up here. We had dinner and went to our hotel where Bruce said his throat was sore. He said it was burning. I was concerned about it as my trip the next day was to visit my Father who was in the hospital with complications from Leukemia/Chemotherapy. I was worried about myself becoming sick while I was visiting. I never did get sick but I spoke with Bruce everyday I was gone and he said he was not feeling well everyday I was spoke with him. \n\nI returned to Seattle a few days later and spent my first night in our new place in Ferndale. I woke up that first night several times coughing. I specifically recall wondering what was irritating my throat as it was not a cough that felt like I was becoming sick. Just an irritating, dry, unproductive cough. This was the beginning of a nightmare. I started to not feel well in all kinds of ways. My throat was burning, I felt sick to my stomach, and I kept coughing. \n\nThe next thing that happened was the second night at our place. As it was July, it was hot out. I had several windows open trying to cool the place off. While downstairs in our bedroom I suddenly began to feel as though I was going to suffocate. I had the window in our room wide open and still I felt like I could not breathe adequately. I began talking about not being able to sleep in our room and having to get out of there and panicking. I could smell something that I would describe as pollution. It was strong. I was about ready to have my boyfriend call 911 I was so scared about suffocating. \n\nThe next day we drove to our storage unit and as we were unloading our Haul in Ferndale our neighbor whom we shared the duplex with came outside on her front porch and lit up. Cigarette. This was surprising to me as they advertised all of there units as no smoking. Being a former smoker I did not really want to be around smokers because it has not been a year since I quit. What happened next was unreal. Our neighbor proceeded to tell me how she had to have her front porch replaced. She had set it on fire by putting a cigarette butt in a can without enough liquid in it and it started her porch on fire. The fire dept. was called and the porch was so bad it had to be replaced. So now I have rented a place next door to someone who has already started a fire. \n\nWithin a week another neighbor in the building next door to us flicked his cigarette into the bark in front of his place and my boyfriend came home from work to find it on fire. \n\nAs for the burning throat, suffocation fears? The property had been sprayed with Crossbow in a manner that was done without any regards for people living there. I have over 200 pictures of this massive application of known carcinogenic herbicide. Windermere let us out of our lease but did absolutely nothing to help us relocate. In fact they actually retaliated against me when after 5 weeks of daily poisoning I became impatient and emailed them letting them know I was very upset with their unresponsiveness. I documented everything daily. We got out of there after two of the worst months of my entire life. God knows what long term health impacts we may suffer. \n\nI can tell you all this much, Windermere did not care one bit about us and the horror we had to deal with worrying about the lady next door and the herbicide issue. BEWARE!!!!!",

        "review": "Moved in with three adult family members. House was brand new (still getting finished when we signed the lease, couldn't move in for a week) but had mud under the stove, scuffs throughout the house, ect...\n\nA year later (no longer on lease, but month to month) we get a notice saying that they were upping the rent by $50. The letters were sent out on the 7th, the last day in which a tenant can inform them that they intended to move without paying for the next month. We informed them on the 15th. Given when we moved in, this was our last day to inform them that we were leaving. Everything was going fine until they said we had to pay for the next month. We called them out on the date of the letters. We also informed them about how we were not allowed to move in for a week despite already paying (we received not back pay for this week either). We also consulted a lawyer on this, who said they were in the wrong.\n\nA few weeks passed, we moved into another place, everything seemed fine. That is, until they sent us an email saying we owed them $500!! They were charging us for the following month's rent, professional carpet, and house cleaning. The house was completely spotless when we returned it, there were no holes in the walls, and there was nothing in the lease about professional house cleaning, only carpet. That place probably looked better than when we moved in.\n\nWe should have sued them. Never, NEVER again!! Beware because if all of the Windermere offices are as shady as these guys, you'll get worked over BIG TIME.",

        "review": "Windermere was the Property Managment company for The Avalon Apartments while I lived there from 2014-2015.  I decided I had to finally share my story, because I came across another review that said something that helped me to connect the dots with what happened to me there.  What was said is that the maintenance is there constantly to spy on tenants and is, in fact, the owners of the property.  You'll see why this piece of information is important...\nWhile I was there, I saw the \"Maitenance\"(man and woman) on site nearly every single day.  At the time I actually didn't mind it.  It is in old building, and I figured that they were renovation it one unit at a time.  It also gave me a false sense of safety.  I felt that I had a good rapport with them, and talked to them on many occasions.  I got the sense that they liked me, as I was a quiet, working professional that didn't ever have parties.  One time I had a work order for a plumbing issue, and they had even commented on how clean the place was, and how they liked how I decorated the apartment. When my lease was up I gave proper notice that I would be moving out, as I was moving across the country for my job.  I had paid over 900 in total for my damage deposit, and wanted to be sure I did everything I could to get it back.  I specifically asked \"Maitenance\" what I could do to insure that would happen.  The floors there are the original wood that they paint brown.  I had a very heavy table that had chipped some of the paint on the floor, and asked them if they would like me to repaint the area.  They told me not to worry about it as they already have the perfect matching color, and that I wouldn't be charged for small chips.  Other than that I left the apartment spotless, and in better condition than I found it.  Now comes the part when I got royally screwed: When I went to get my deposit back from Windermere Property Managment, it was for only about 100 dollars.  I was shown a series of pictures that were either old photos, or staged.  For example: there was a picture of the stove top(that I had left spotless) with crumbs and a long black hair on it. (I was blonde at the time). They used the chipped floor, which I was told not to worry about, to charge me hundreds of dollars to repaint the entire apartment.  I could have done the same job myself for 25 dollars had they not been deceptive about it.  There was also a very old rust spot on top of the refrigerator that I did not include on my move-in sheet, because I did not see it, and it's typically not a place people look.  Even the woman at Windermere told me that she could tell that it was there for much longer than I had lived there, and would \"work on getting my money back for that.\"  I never saw any of that money, or heard from her again.  I contemplated taking them to small claims court, but since I moved so far away it was more trouble than it was worth.  These \"Owners/Maitenance\" are obviously taking advantage of their tenants, and double dipping.  Shame on them, and shame on Windermere Property Managment for allowing them to do it.  Future renters beware!  If you do decide to rent from them anyway, just be sure to take photos and video of everything before you leave so that you have proof of how you left it.  Lesson learned on my part.",

        "review": "I've never rented from an actual rental company before - I've only ever rented from private parties. I am by nature opposed to big corporations, so when I was rental-shopping, I avoided homes rented by Windermere, and other places like it. But a home I really wanted to see was Windermere's, so I finally gave in and took a look. I'm soo glad I did, because it was definitely the house for me.\n\nI have never had ANY problems or issues of ANY kind with Windermere or Ebright Wight. Doug Wight is just about the nicest guy in the world, and the best landlord I could ever have hoped to have. He is honest, he is fair, and he gets things done. Any time I have any issue or problem with my house, he sends someone right over. The girls in the office are always super nice and helpful, and I have never had any complaints whatsoever. \n\nMaybe I will sing a different song when I move out (if? I love it here.), but the security deposit wasn't even that high, so though I hope they don't keep it, as I've taken really excellent care of my house, if they do, they do. That's part of renting. \n\nIf the other renter had mentioned the dirty carpets to them when he moved in, I'll bet they would have sent someone over to clean them. Even I knew to make a list of anything wrong with the house before I moved in, and I've never done this before. I'm also bothered that he listed a lot of positives about Windermere and even said it's \"not the worst company to rent from,\" but then he gave them only 1 star? Come on. How about we rate on our experience as a whole, not penalize them for our own inability to report damage to our unit upon arrival. \n\nAs for the repair man letting himself in without authorization, it's inexcusable. I've never had it happen to me, and nothing in the world would upset me more in the capacity of renting. But I've lived here 3.5 years, and filled out my share of work order requests, and they've always been really good about calling me ahead of time. Never once have they shown up without my authorizing it. \n\nI have always paid my rent on time, and taken care of my home. I can't speak for deadbeats who don't do the same. If you're a responsible person, I absolutely recommend Windermere/Ebright Wight. I am beyond blessed to live in one of their homes. I can't rave about it more.",

Furthermore, she explained if I want to apply I have to fill out  an application and pay $40.00 fee and wait for her manager to check and make a decision about approving or disapproving my application.  She said they already collected $40.00 for that place from previous applicant who is waiting for answer.  Then I requested to talk to her manager.  She connected me w/a designated broker SANDY JONES!  Wow!  What a lunatic and pure idiot is that SANDY JONES!  SANDY JONES said by law they can charge $40.00 fee for as many applicants as they wish/apply for the same unit.  Unbelievable!

It was worse than a portapottie seat and could not be cleaned properly it was so old. I asked for a new one repeatedly and finally my crabby husband got them to do something about it. I don't want to know how. They don't return calls or emails. Also a few months ago I changed my online payment method from auto pay to a one time bank draft. I have never missed a payment and the money was drafted from my bank account on time. Nevertheless I came home to an eviction notice on the 15th stating I had not paid. I had to verify my payment for them and they finally figured out that it was a \"glitch in the accounting program.\" They didn't even apologize. I read somewhere that it's the law for carpets to be cleaned between tenants, and that's why there is Always a cleaning fee no matter how clean you leave it. I guarantee no vacuum clean ever touched the carpet much less a carpet shampooer. I did it myself once I identified the smell coming from the carpet upstairs as being pet related. Pets aren't even allowed. One of the garage remotes didn't work when we moved in which was fine since we didn't need it. I listed it in the form when we moved in as needing to be fixed, and 10 months later I came home to a note on the door stating that they would be entering the apartment- again- for repairs/maintenance. I left the remote out-- again- and behold it works now. The actual property itself is nice enough, but I've been in other Windermere properties that were downright nasty. It just depends on how well previous tenants kept things. I could keep going... but I don't have all day.",

It was really not a bad experience overall, I enjoyed my apartment and they were friendly enough in the office. The only real problems I had were one time, without any legal notice, a repair man entered my apartment while I was sleeping. Also when I moved out, they charged me 74 dollars (tax, parts, and labor) to replace the thermostat knob on a heater in the bedroom, and 60 dollars to clean the apartment when I had somebody professionally clean it before, and 80 dollars to clean the dirty carpet. I was able to get back 30 dollars of the cleaning fee, so Windermere was fair in that sense. I wouldn't say they are the worst company to rent from but you just need to REALLY make sure that you take pictures when you move in and pictures when you move out.",

        "review": "I rented a duplex in Blaine from Windermere Management by Ebright Wight a couple of years ago. The place smelled odd when I moved in...turned out it was mold. I washed the walls continuely and still the mold would return. My neighbors had the same problems. They were getting nose bleeds. I had a baby that was born preterm and the hospital would not allow me to bring him home with mold as my baby had chronic lung disease and was on oxygen full time. I called the office and told them the situation and they said that the mold was, \"Not there problem!\" The only saving grace was my sister had a friend that was high up in the corporate Windermere company and she had to call this Winderemere company and explain to them that yes, indeed it is their problem. So I was able to move into a new apartment mold free. When I moved out of my new apartment a year later they were not going to give my deposit back after I spent 3 days detailing the apartment. I used to be an apartment cleaner for a major Seattle apartment management company and was trained by Bellingham Housing Authority in turning over apartments. So I know how to clean an apartment and do it well. When I left the apartment looked cleaner then when I moved in. I did the preceedings to take them to court but settled out of court at mediation. I got what I wanted and deserved but only after fighting for it. They only care about money and good luck getting your deposit back. I was a great renter who paid my rent not only on time but a month in advance. From my personal experience,beware of this management company.",

In the three months since then, Emma remained my rental agent through a series of challenges, which included a complete rebuild of the condo. As you can imagine, this re-build process posed many challenges to the landlord (me) and the renters. (Its a long story, but lets just say it was very complicated.)

My first months rent was denied twice due to insufficient funds when I triple checked that I had it then they made us pay by cashiers check or bill payment check through our bank, when I came to our last month paying rent, we got charged a late fee saying our rent was late when I have tracking information on my checks mailed and saw that they cashed it during our grace period and they proceeded to tell me that my bank probably takes the the money out before it reaches them. I had them dispute the charge since they took my payments on the same day every month and never got a late fee. We had them tell us 3 times about our dog poop and they claimed to have video footage but wouldnt provide the proof and wouldnt come look at the property themselves to see that there was no dog poop. Now after moving out, we deep cleaned the place before we handed in our keys. After 21 days they came back with invoices and charges for damages that werent necessary like they charged us for a carpet clean but also charged us for new carpet? Makes so sense. And also charged us for normal wear and tear like repainting of the windowsills and handrails. I highly recommend staying away from WPM if youre a young single adult, they like to take advantage of us.",

They do not return phone calls or emails. We had a light out for two months in our apartment before they came by to replace it (the actual fixture was broken).\n- We smelled sewage within a few days of moving into our brand new building (The Vantage at 418 W Bakerview). The person who fielded my weekend call told me that was not enough of a reason to send emergency maintenance. They sent someone a few days later who determined there was no issue. Only after water started pouring into the unit below did they send someone else to fix what turned out to be a massive leak behind the wall under our kitchen sink.\n- The person who fixed that leak then sealed up the STILL wet area behind the cabinets until it started to smell. I can't tell you how many times I had to call the office to get them to respond to that maintenance request. My multiple requests for professional mold inspection were ignored. They looked under the sink, tested for moisture, and decided that was good enough.\n- The wall heaters are installed so close to the doors in the apartment that they were melting. I put in a maintenance request expressing concern for fire hazard and even followed up with a phone call. Never heard back.\n\nIf you value your safety and health in your living space, try to rent from literally anybody else. And definitely don't choose a unit at The Vantage.",

I am not going to remove the previous review as I think it is important for people to know that they should stay on top of their application throughout the whole process. I do however want to give them credit for working with myself and my roommate and doing everything they could to keep us updated and help us find a place to live so last minute, especially Tanya, Ashley, and Frank. Although I am still frustrated about my initial experience, I definitely am very appreciative of the effort that has been put forth since.\n\nIm usually not one to post bad reviews and try to give companies and people the benefit of the doubt but I am so upset after my experience with Windermere that I feel like I have to speak up. I am giving them 2 stars because the staff has been very pleasant and I dont think that my experience was the fault of any one person but rather a flaw somewhere in the system. My roommate and I submitted an application for one of their properties and were told when we called to ask about the property that no other applications had been submitted. They also shared that they approve or deny applications in the order that they are received. We then called back a combined total of at least 8 different times between myself and my roommate to check the status of the application and to try and get a showing scheduled to see the property. We were told it would only take a few days to process the application. After a week, I was finally able to see the property and was told by the manager that she would make sure that our application was processed as soon as she returned to the office. All of this was fine until we received a text message over a week after submitting our application that another application had been approved today and that our application had been denied. This was despite the fact that we were told our application was the first to be submitted and that we should be getting the decision days prior. I dont understand how we would be denied in favor of someone else if our application was the only one submitted at the time that we paid our fees and they claim to be first come first serve but somewhere along the way our application was not prioritized in the order we were told it would be. I am extremely frustrated and the only reason that I am considering looking into renting a different apartment with them would be to try and make up for the $65 in application fees that I have already lost and given that the application remains open for 90 days.",

Tonya found us a gorgeous place in a market that is overpriced and out of control. Great experience since day one, very fast approval process. We moved in the house in less than 24 hours from seeing it. Great experience with Tonya and all the staff there too. We needed maintenance once and they were prompt to send somebody next day.\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, one really got stuck in my head so I'll share my thoughts about it. I think it is unfair to give a management company a one star review because you have pets but the owner wouldn't allow it. Find a place that allows pets and move in, or buy your own and do whatever you want with it.\n\nWe recently moved out and in less than 2 weeks we received our deposit back, and a follow up call to make sure that everything went great with the move.\n\nLong story short, our experience was great. Tonya is awesome, the staff is awesome.\n\nThank you again for a great experience!",

The place itself was okay, though prone to mold and the windows did not close properly (they came with dowel rods to put in the tracks since they wouldnt lock). We filed maintenance requests on several occasions and they were almost always ignored (including that a pipe was leaking through the wall near an outlet when we turned on the outdoor spigot, and that the driveway was so covered in snow that it caused several accidents and was a safety hazard). These things were never addressed. We left the apartment in good condition, other than some damage done by a roommate that we gave the property manager a heads up about and took full responsibility for. We expected some money to be deducted from our security deposit for that damage, but when the charges came in the mail, Windermere took ALL of our deposit AND WAS ASKING FOR MORE. They deducted for things like about 8 hours of cleaning and full paint. They also charged for picking up trash that was outside of our bedroom window under our upstairs neighbors stairs, which was there when we moved in. They eventually dropped that charge after I wrote to dispute most of the charges, but we still ended up having to pay about $140 on top of losing our whole security deposit. We had moved out of state and it was not worth going to court over, which Im sure Windermere counts on. I should note that most of these issues happened under the watch of the previous property manager, and Ashley, the new property manager seemed very friendly in our correspondence about the security deposit, though Im sure she was limited on the help she could provide since she stepped in just at the end of our lease. I do not recommend renting from this company, and if you do, be sure to document everything.",

We were treated fairly and I believe that if you follow policy, read through expectations and do what is required on your end that they will do the same.  When we moved out,  we left the unit clean and in good shape and we received our deposit refund pretty quickly.

My roommate and I found an affordable but old apartment near Western Washington University that needed a lot of repairs like; fixing the balcony doors, the window sill in one of the bedrooms wasnt fully sealed to the wall and cold air would blow through the gap when it was windy, also not all the electrical outlets worked and some went out, etc. I texted and called Tonya on multiple occasions for various issues especially the balcony doors which she had promised to fix after we moved in. Tonya specifically told us that the doors had already been ordered. I waited to hear back from Windermere about proceeding with replacing the doors and after not hearing a response I texted Tonya again and didnt hear back from her until months later. Anytime my roommate or I had an issue, Tonya from Windermere was so slow to respond which was very unprofessional. I had a lot of patience and kept putting all issues aside but Windermere was to slow to fix the problems. Also the balcony doors were never replaced and I have texts to prove they were going to be replaced from Tonya. I barely stayed a year at this place before moving on. Plus there was one night when a car caught fire in front of the apartment building and it didnt feel safe anymore. Overall the service that Windermere provided wasnt professional and they were very slow to respond and I will avoid going through any more apartments processes with them ever again.",

When I moved back here it was so hard to find a place especially in our price range. When we found our home she helped me so much with the process of getting set up it made it so much easier on me and my family. She treated me not just well, but like family. She was always professional and she always had my back when we had a disagreement with the neighbors. She fought for me when I needed something, she was always super fast getting back to me, if I ever needed any help with anything regarding the home I am renting. Even in her spare time she would respond to me if I ever had a question or needed something. I would recommend Tonya Wiley to anybody looking for a rental in the Bellingham area she is a breath of fresh air and a ball of sunshine in the community. She always does her best to help others and she doesnt expect anything in return. I feel so lucky that I had her as my property manager for the year that I did. I know that in the future if I ever need to find Another rental or home that Tonya is who I would be contacting for any of those needs. She is not only an amazing businesswoman but she is my friend and I just wanted to share what an amazing experience I had as her client. She really helped me when I needed it the most and I will never forget that. Windermere property management is very lucky to have her. Also, the front staff at Windermere was always so kind and sweet every interaction I had with them. I never had any complaints I stand behind Windermere as a company and I stand behind Tonya Wiley as a property manager.

We had to pay a double deposit to move in to our place and half of that was taken away after moving out. The paint job was spotty when we moved in and was in same condition upon moving out but they charged us to repaint. The entire experience was more work than it was worth. I recommend avoiding working with this company unless absolutely desperate. I 100% believe they overcharged for every single thing including utilities that \"had\" to be billed through them and couldn't come directly to me. There responses to questions or issues were slow and incomplete or just non existent. The property listing was inaccurate stating \"pets possible\" which was one of the reasons we chose the property and after moving in were told no pets when all the neighbors had pets. I will definitely never work with any windermere branch or affiliation again because of this experience. The property manager was never of any help and out of office everytime we tried to contact.

We have had so many issues with Windermere, most of them involving the property manager not contacting us or responding to emails and phone calls. The icing on the cake was when we were never notified that Windermere was taking over (admittedly not Windermere's fault) however, then four months later I was doing my personal budget and we discovered that our condo dues had stopped automatically coming out. For 4 months we were never notified that we were not paying our condo dues! That is very alarming as a property owner when those dues are important to maintaining a reserve fund. Then, when I identified the problem, Windermere did not apologize at all for the issue and I had difficulty getting any one to call/email me back to try to rectify this issue. I could go on and on and I've only had Windermere managing my condo association for less than 6 months! The most recent issue is that we were served a random letter about needing a new water heater because it was over 10 years old. Now I can't get a call back about that! If you are paying money to have your property managed, find a different company. I am sorry to say you will be disappointed with Windermere.

We made the mistake of being too confident in how nice we left the place that when we moved out that we didn't take any photos and got charged outrageously for things that didn't make sense or exist.\n\nWhen we first moved in, there was holes in window screens, a glue stain on the wall or something from putting carpet down (we assume that's what it is, we've tried washing it but it didn't come out with cleaner) when we first moved in. These things we pointed out when we noticed, along with a broken handle on the microwave but was shrugged off because it personally didn't bother us. There was also things already existing on the property. The garage was full of home maintenance materials, such as wood, paint, and other things. There was a shed full of miscellaneous things that looked to be there for years that we were told belonged to the home owner so we didn't touch it.\nNow we're getting charged for these things, as well as the glue on the wall being blamed on our pet.\n\nWe made sure this place was spotless and we only lived in it a year with very little use. There was a scrape on the wall from our chair and that was it. But somehow we're getting charged OVER our deposit amount. Over things like lightbulbs and other ridiculous things! We unfortunately didn't take photos, they didn't even give us a walk around to ok things either.\n\nAfter we had moved out they told us some time into the next month for the first time that if we didn't hand over the keys they'd charge us another month's rent. We never had this before because locks are usually replaced by home owners making the keys useless (beware on that also if you plan on renting from them).\nWe were moved up into Canada at the time but luckily we had to do one last run into the states to cover bases so we were able to return the keys in time.\n\nWe have never had issues with any of the rental properties we've lived in. We always got full or 90% of our deposit back. We always have had shining reviews with our landlords. We pride ourselves as good tenants.\nIf you plan on renting from Windermere, be prepared to be swindled out of every penny they can manage to get out of you.

This was the only notice we were given that it was to happen today, so when my husband found it taped to the INSIDE of our front door when he got home from the store today he was livid. He called Windermere to see why they hadn't tried to call or email, but got nothing but excuses.\n\nThis wouldn't upset me so much if I was not working a night shift tonight and ASLEEP UPSTAIRS while complete strangers were in my house.

I would just suggest (as for anyone looking to lease anything) to be very specific on your move-in inspections when noting any previous damages as to not have any problems when moving out!\n\nOverall, don't expect the units to be perfect in a college town, but if you pay your bills and are responsible tenants, everything will be just fine.

The judge clearly informed you that there was no basis for your claims of theft from your apartment home and your storage unit or for the condition of the apartment home when you returned your keys. The home needed paint, hauling, cleaning, repairs of a wall heater and towel bar as well as carpet cleaning. You were provided photos in court as to the documented condition of the home. You were also carrying a past due balance on your account going into the reconciliation process. Since we do not manage the storage unit where other theft was reported, we cannot speak to that situation. We offered to re-key your unit when we were informed by you of the alleged theft, and you opted to have it done. According to you the theft continued. We have no control should you leave your doors or windows unsecured. We advised that you should call the police and provide them with dates, times and descriptions of the perpetrators. In court you said you called the police many times and they never responded. You did say also that you attempted to retrieve your lost items from a neighbor and were arrested. Our hope is that you are able to retrieve your personal effects and that you can move forward."

Bethany in particular has been extremely kind and helpful! Where should I begin?\n\nWell, first, before we even signed the lease, there was an issue that arose from us applying to a property the owner of which didn't want rented to students. We all somehow overlooked this on its listing, and since I was just starting graduate school I declared that I was a student on my application. We were initially denied the property, but I felt that \"students\" wasn't intended to mean graduate students in their mid 20s, so I wrote them a letter explaining that I understood they need to respect the property owner's stipulations and asked if my appeal and the explanation of the circumstances could be forwarded to you owner. Bethany responded to my email and was was very nice and understanding. She explained the situation to the owner, and we ended up getting the house! Yay!\n\nWhile we lived there, they were really good about giving us notices of entry on time, and they didn't micromanage the property we rented at all--not even after they came in for an annual inspection, or when our lawn mower broke and our yard was a jungle for a few weeks while we Craiglisted around for a new one. No guff was given, it was really pleasant to rent from them. I've had many landlords that breathe down tenants' necks. I remember once, when I was a kid growing up in Montana, my family rented from someone who insisted that we shovel the walkway WHILE it was snowing. In Montana! I don't remember if it was an individual or a property manager, but the moral of this story is that landlords can be absolutely crazy.\n\nI think we were even late on our rent once, and I don't believe they dinged us for it.\n\nBut moving out this past week has been where Windermere has really shown me how accommodating they can be if you're nice about things. June rolled around, and we got notice that the house wasn't going to be re-rented after our lease expired, so we had to find a new place--fast. We found a place that became available on or a few days after the first of July, so there was going to be a day or two (or three) period where we didn't have a house. We were fine with this, but the problem was that we have four tropical fishtanks that need to be plugged in all the time. It looked like we had two options: move the fish tanks to the middle of a very generous friend's living room or garage, only to move them once more after a few days (which would stress the fish out twice as much as a normal move would, and would SUCK SO BAD since these are large tanks and all have live plants), or see if Windermere will allow us to keep them on the property after we were supposed to be totally out. Bethany again understood our situation and we were able to just leave the tanks there for a week after they could have legally disposed of them. This took a LOT of stress off of our shoulders. I really appreciated all this flexibility and reasonableness, and if I find myself renting in Bellingham again, I'll be sure to check Windermere's listings first. Thanks for working with us like you have!",

We would like to take this opportunity to respond to your comment.\nWe imagine your unfavorable review is written in response to the Deposit Disposition letter you received recently.\nThe back side of the move out notice provides a comprehensive list of items that need your attention prior to move out. It is very important that the unit is left in good condition and ready for the next tenant to move in. Unfortunately this was not the case when you vacated your unit. The unit was left dirty and required 5 hours of cleaning. The kitchen was particularly dirty. The paint was new upon move in and according to HUD guidelines the life expectancy for paint is 5-7 years. When you moved out there was damage done to the paint beyond normal wear and tear. The walls throughout had black soot damage on them to which left outlines on the walls where items had been hanging. You were charged for  of the cost to paint the unit.\nWe work very hard to be fair to our tenants while still doing what is right by the property owner. If you have items you would like to discuss regarding your experience with Windermere Management, we would be happy to meet with you."

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'><section><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This article is generated by ChatGPT and is only intended to be a tool to help individuals find a property management company or rental property. The summary of user reviews is based on past experiences and reviews and does not guarantee future satisfaction. The article aims to provide balanced insights, recognizing both the shortcomings and excellence of Windermere Property Management as reflected in user reviews.</p></section><section><h2>Good</h2><p>Some tenants of Windermere Property Management praise the company for its responsiveness and helpfulness in certain instances. There are reports of situations where maintenance issues, once communicated effectively, were handled promptly, and staff were commended for their friendliness and professionalism. Positive experiences highlighted instances where personalized attention, such as attentiveness to emergencies and understanding specific tenant concerns, led to satisfaction. Even among some negative reviews, there are acknowledgements of kind interactions with staff and appreciation for their efforts to amicably resolve disputes when they arose.</p><p>Similarly, property owners have expressed appreciation for Windermere's tenant placement services. Some landlords reflect positively on their long-term business relationships with Windermere, indicating successful tenant retention and timely rent payments. The staff at Windermere are occasionally described as a welcoming presence, making both landlords and tenants feel valued during their interactions. Notwithstanding mixed reviews, the favorable experiences suggest that Windermere can meet client needs under certain circumstances.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Certain clients have had \"great\" experiences working directly with some of Windermere's agents and property managers. Specific individuals within the company have been named as particularly supportive, diligence, and acting beyond standard expectations. These agents and managers were highlighted for their exceptional work ethic, attention to detail, and for facilitating a \"dream\" scenario for clients amidst the reputedly competitive rental market conditions. There were special mentions of situations where the process from viewing to moving into a rental was efficient and pleasant, thanks to the commendable efforts of specific Windermere representatives.</p><p>From the property ownership perspective, there are testimonials about agents who offered insightful advice, demonstrated flexibility, and exhibited professionalism that led to the successful and profitable management of rental properties. The expressions of gratitude suggest that with the right match of management staff, Windermere can provide a high-quality management experience, reflective of the \"great\" potential that resides within the company.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>On the flip side, the bad aspects reported by clients include Windermere's apparent neglect towards maintenance concerns. Some reviews mention long delays in responding to repair requests, with tenants having to persistently follow-up to resolve serious issues such as mold presence or lack of heat. There are also mentions of experiences where rather basic maintenance, such as light bulb replacements, were either addressed inefficiently or billed at surprisingly high costs. Furthermore, concerns about transparency regarding lease terms and conditions were raised, suggesting that Windermere\u2019s communication and customer service could be inconsistent and lacking.</p><p>Negative feedback about the tenant screening process has been noted as well, with potential tenants expressing confusion over rental policies, and some feeling misled by the qualification criteria. Moreover, the rental application process is described as labor-intensive and a financial strain due to non-refundable fees, especially when prospects aren't offered a viewing prior to application submission. These experiences cast a shadow on the company's customer care practices and suggest room for significant improvement.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The \"ugly\" aspects are characterized by several severe allegations against Windermere Property Management. Some reviews describe experiences of alleged deceitful practices where security deposits were withheld for questionable reasons, or tenants were overcharged for damages and cleaning that they contend were pre-existing or unwarranted. Accusations are made of Windermere mistreating tenants by ignoring serious issues like black mold, ineffective heating systems, or broken security features that directly impact living conditions and safety. Moreover, numerous accounts critique the company's response time and customer service, depicting a systemic problem that ranges from unreturned phone calls and emails to rude or dismissive attitudes by the staff.</p><p>Those who claim to have had serious grievances with Windermere report feeling marginalized and financially exploited, sharing stories of property neglect and administrative indifference leading to health hazards and insecure living environments. Additionally, several reviewers outright accuse the company of discriminatory and retaliatory practices, suggesting an overall culture disconnect between the company's values and the actual experience of certain clients. This collection of negative reviews paints an \"ugly\" picture where the gaps between expectations and reality are not just inconvenient but can be deeply distressing and costly for those involved.</p></section></article>"
