I asked if they had 3 and 4 bed rooms only. she cut me off and told me they only have 4 beds to rent right now. I said it might be a while till we can move as in a months. she cut me off again and said well them you should call about a month before you move and ill answer any question then. \nI felt like I did not matter since I was not moving in next week. well i'm sorry I just might have rent another apartment down the road. my family was interested in 4 apartment. we are all moving so that we can be together. but I don't think we will be moving here. I just had questions about deposits.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>There is little information to be found under the \"Good\" section for Larkin Place Apts, as the user reviews available do not provide complimentary feedback. The intent of this article is not to misrepresent the sentiments of the reviewers by exaggerating the positive aspects when such sentiments are not expressed in the user reviews.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Again, the current data does not reflect experiences that could be categorized as \"Great.\" To maintain the integrity of the review process and to ensure credibility, this article will not fabricate greatness where none has been indicated by the reviewers. The great section for Larkin Place Apts remains empty until such reviews are available.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>In the \"Bad\" section, users have expressed frustration with the communication skills of the property management at Larkin Place Apts. One user detailed an unpleasant experience with the staff over the phone, where their inquiries were met with curt responses and an overall unhelpful attitude. This denotes a lack of customer service skills and a disinterest in engaging with prospective tenants unless they are planning to move imminently.</p><p>Furthermore, the user\u2019s desire to have their questions answered regarding apartment availability and deposit information was dismissed, which underscores the property management\u2019s apparent policy of deferring inquiries until closer to the prospective move-in date. This approach can be inconvenient for people trying to plan their relocations well in advance and suggests a possible lack of accommodation for the needs of future tenants.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The \"Ugly\" segment highlights a missed opportunity by the property management to secure multiple tenants. The review specifies that a family interested in renting four apartments was put off by the treatment they received. This particular incident not only reflects poorly on the community's reputation but also indicates a significant potential revenue loss. It is clear from this user review that better communication and a more welcoming approach by the property management could greatly improve their community relations and the property's overall success.</p></section>"
