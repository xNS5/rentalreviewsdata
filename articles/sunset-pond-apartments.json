I dont often leave public reviews but it was such a pleasant experience that I wanted to give a shout-out for her taking the time and answering all of my questions. She really knew the property she managed. I will definitely be renting from her when my lease is up in 2 months. Property is beautiful and kept clean.",

The manager is very professional and make sure she keeps the property is in good condition. She does everything in her power to take care of the homeless situation. Some of the reviewes are not fair she does all that she can when dealing with homless. I have lived here several years and plan on being here for several more. Keep up the good work Kasha!  You do a good job at doing your job.",

        "review": "It doesnt even deserve the one star. We were robbed in multiple ways including, by a intruder, of our deposit, paying more due to fabricated lies of how we kept the condition of the place, management is not approachable and non supportive. After having a truder enter our apartment, we were verbally told that we could purchase security devices that would be reimbursed. Management refused to pay and stated she did not agree to that statement. Also, kept and left the space very clean to have lies stated of the condition the space was left in. Also, have to pay more than double the deposit. Very disappointed and definitely not recommend!",

I've been here 1 week and my jaw keeps hitting the floor with how amazing this place is and how kind and helpful the staff are. My first day here, the dryer wasn't working properly and maintenance showed up within the hour! Kasha at the front desk is warm and friendly, and she is the reason everything went so smoothly for us. She is an advanced problem solver and I feel very lucky to be here with my two kids.",

Location is pretty great.\nThere's plenty of homeless in the area,  but they mainly keep to themselves.  Cars get broken into,  but there's not much you can do to change that.. it's the area. So if you don't mind putting up with some slight inconveniences by homeless population,  you might enjoy living here.",

        "review": "The apartment: Very large 2 bedroom with huge walk in closet, open concept living room/kitchen, nice locking storage off the patio, nice vinyl double pane windows and sliders lets in plenty of daylight, stack washer dryer too!. For the rent amount, you can't get better square footage.  The property: Free assigned, covered parking, large indoor pool, hot tub and sauna, nice workout room , pool table in clubhouse and yes, you can reserve the clubhouse for a party or gathering! Water, sewer and garbage is paid which is excellent! Walk-ability: Within walking to stores, movie theatre, restaurants, etc... On Site manager and Staff:  Kasha is a highly trained professional manager who happens to live on site.  This is getting rare as most apartment management companies are faceless and have no real vested interest in their home.  This is her home and she continually makes property improvements. The maint. staff are friendly and prompt. The housekeeper/groundskeeper does an excellent job as well.  We're moving to a warmer climate but I would recommend Sunset Pond Apartments.",

The pool and clubhouse is kept in excellent condition and a great place to have a gathering or just relax at. The office lady Kasha is amazing. She is so kind and professional. She stays on top of keeping the complex well maintained and running as smoothly as possible. If I call with a maintenance request she put the order in right away and has the issue addressed. Kasha does an amazing job and I don't think she is given enough praise for all that she does.\nThank you Kasha ",

        "review": "I moved into sunset pond apartments at the end of March 2023. The application process was smooth and predictable thanks to Kasha, the office manager. Kasha is professional and kind. She made the acceptance criteria clear and was certain to reach out promptly if more information was required for approval. After approval I was given a move in date. Maintenance efficiently turned my unit and I moved in on schedule. Maintenance clearly takes pride in their work and it was obvious that they paid attention to the details while turning my unit. The cleaner also left my unit spotless.\n\nDo your research on the area so you understand and are comfortable in your new neighborhood. Overall I am completely satisfied with Sunset Pond Apartments, excited to live here, enjoy the amazing amenities, and pleased to work with Sunset Pond staff!",

        "review": "Not a safe place to live, only has residents due to there not being many options elsewhere. Loud neighbors who threw toys and trash onto our patio. Didn't seem to be any consequences because of how often it happened. Loud all the time, had my car broken into, and bike stolen here. Parking sometimes wasn't guaranteed because cars had been abandoned there for months. Paying rent in out dated inconvenient ways, with only check or money order. Better off anywhere I promise you. 2 stars because you can sign a month to month lease, letting you move out as soon as you can.",

        "review": "This was the worst place I have ever lived and I do not have one positive thing to say about it.  Management was hostile and I have evidence of them lying and charging me wrong multiple times. They did not care about me being harassed by my neighbors, did not care that my toilet overflowed everytime the neighbors did laundry, did not care when there was standing water in my kitchen, did not care when my property was stolen off my porch or my car windows bashed in. There's always trash all over the parking lot, they raise rent every few months, post office even told me they won't deliver packages to this location because they got in an argument with the office.... not shocking.\nWhen I moved out of here my life improved tenfold. Do not sign a lease here, I promise you it is not worth it and your health will suffer- and don't believe the obviously fake bought reviews all saying this is a magical place. No one who lived here and has dealt with the property manager would ever honestly say that.",

The one thing that is quite annoying is the amount of times they need to come into your apartment. We are constantly getting notices on our door of them 'fixing something' we didnt do, and checking around the apartment. It seems a little suspicious. Other then that, its fine.

        "review": "I've lived in this place for five years, and there's not much to recommend.\nThe maintenance staff is amazing but the admin staff is extremely mediocre. Just today we arranged a schedule around an alleged water shut off that we got last minute notice about. It turns out the notice was posted to the wrong building, but no one on the office staff bothered to walk a block and let folks know about the mistake.\nThat is the kind of utterly atrocious customer service I have come to expect from the office staff. They won't tell me who their managers are so I am resorting to posting this publicly.\nOnce again, I think the apartments are fine, the maintenance staff are amazing, but unfortunately if you're looking you can probably do better. (or maybe the apartment market in Bellingham is tight enough that you are willing to deal with a lot of nonsense from ownership and their office employees, if so, I look forward to meeting new friendly neighbors, there's a lot of great folks here and if you play your cards right you rarely have to interact with the office folks.)\n\nIt's entirely possible that the office staff is over stressed in a difficult job, but once I called to complain about not getting advance notice for a water shut off and the office employee said \"f*** you\" and hung up the phone.\n\nThat's what you're getting yourself into if you move here, but again, great maintenance staff if you can successfully get the office to take down a maintenance request, which to be fair they do somewhat accurately about two thirds of the time.\n\nThis might be a two and a half star review but I'm rounding down to let prospective renters know about this major issue.",

        "review": "Good Ole Sunset Pond.. ONLY good thing about these apartments is how affordable this trashy place is. If you can avoid leasing/renting here, do yourself the favor of paying the extra hundred somewhere far away from here in a safer/cleaner environment. I definitely learned my lesson.\n\nThe first year of living here, I experienced MANY random knocks at my door in the middle of the night when Im by myself leading me to have full panic attacks. My family that lives 10minutes away would have to come over @3am to check up on me. How can I not feel safe in my very own home??\n\nMy brand new 2020 car was hit in my very own designated parking space. (Mind you I was given the worst parking space here; by the entry way into the gravel parking lot where theres a big pothole and dumpster where all the homeless people dumpster dive 24/7) I asked for them to please help with my police report by sending in footage which was asked of me and not once did Janice or Kasha help me nor reach back out to let me know that they did.\n\nI started parking my car out in the gravel to avoid this situation again but the amount of homeless people that hangout in that lot with their broken down cars makes me feel incredibly unsafe as a women. One night my 16 year old brother was chased after in his truck by them and he called me freaking out not knowing what to do! Not to mention my sweet neighbors car was broken into recently and not Janice or kasha did anything about it!\n\nKasha confirmed they only have one camera that faces the gravel and it is very faint and hazy. Maybe you guys should get a better security system just in case something really bad happens? Just a thought you guys.\n\nSunset pond apartments, do better.",
