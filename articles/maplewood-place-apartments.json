        "review": "Cheap apartments but you get what you pay for. Management not on site. They give no cares about any problems that arise(which many will that are most likely not your doing) and in fact they will  most likely turn it around to make it about you and how it's your fault and your responsibility. The neighbors alone will make you cringe. Noise at all hours, definitely drugs dealers who have people going in and out. Parking lot is beyond small for all that live there, good luck trying to even fit a regular sized car in those parking spots when it's full. Good luck not getting your car smashed or scratched because others that live there do not understand how to back out or enter such small spaces. Management does a horrible job at communicating all together to new tenants, so if you work late and the only spot you pay for has been taken by someone else. There's nothing you can do. Overflow is always full and street parking as well. So you're looking at illegally parking at the Free masons lodge across the street or miles away from your apartment. Enjoy the cold! It isn't until you ask management to get on the apartment towing list to be able to actually call the tow company and get a car towed out of your spot, not on your dime, when such things happen. But after that happens the first time, good luck not getting your car keyed. There are many who try to warn others about Apex, heed their warning, unlike me who didn't. I will be posting pictures of obvious no goes on this place.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>This article aims to provide a comprehensive view of Maplewood Place Apartments, yet positive highlights were challenging to identify due to the overwhelmingly negative sentiment in user reviews. Even though the property might be affordable, there is little to suggest that tenants experience satisfying living conditions or management support. Affordable rent could be a potential positive for budget-conscious renters, but unfortunately, it doesn't compensate for the various issues highlighted by tenants.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Despite extensive scrutiny of user reviews, this article finds limited examples of truly great aspects of Maplewood Place Apartments. The affordability of the apartments may represent an opportunity for some tenants to save money; however, this comes with numerous trade-offs that may deter potential renters. The residential setup might benefit those who prioritize cost over comfort, but the overarching tenant experiences suggest improvements are necessary for a more positive living environment.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>User reviews highlight several problematic aspects of living at Maplewood Place Apartments, with a significant focus on inadequate management presence and poor communication. The lack of on-site management results in tenant issues being unaddressed promptly, leading to frustrations. Noise and safety seem to be primary concerns, with reports of potential illegal activities, noise pollution, and a chaotic parking situation being prevalent. Tenants express dissatisfaction with a lack of clear guidance and support when issues arise, such as disputes over parking spaces.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most concerning aspects of Maplewood Place Apartments revolve around unresolved safety and maintenance issues, as well as poor infrastructure. Tenants warn of significant issues such as cramped parking spaces and a risk of vehicle damage, alongside a failure by management to enforce rules that prevent unauthorized parking.

With the non-existent management response to escalating concerns, tenants are left to fend for themselves, often leading to further property damage and a deteriorating living experience.</p></section>"
