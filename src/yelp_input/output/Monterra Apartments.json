      "review": "This is NOT a safe place to live. If you're considering renting here, don't.  The residents include several criminals at this time. I've seen threats left on apartment doors and cars. I'd love to break my lease because I feel unsafe, but aparently I cannot. Cars get keyed all the time. We aren't allowed to recycle. There isn't enough parking for the residents. By the time I had lived here 3 months, we had gone through 3 different property managers, and none of them seemed to have a clue what they were doing. I cannot stress enough how terrible living here is. I have had 0 positive experiences with property managers or other tenants.",
