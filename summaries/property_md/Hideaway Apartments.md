## The Great

Despite the modest average review score, some residents expressed contentment with their overall living experience, with a user claiming it reminded them of living in the '90s, possibly suggesting a nostalgic or hassle-free lifestyle. Another user found the proximity to the town center and other essential services to be a great advantage, indicating that the location of Hideaway Apartments may offer an easy and accessible lifestyle for its inhabitants.

Proximity to a bus route can be an invaluable feature for residents, further supporting the notion that Hideaway Apartments could serve as a convenient and strategic choice for those who prioritize location and ease of access in their housing decisions. The complex also offers a degree of flexibility to its residents through its month-to-month lease options, which can be a significant benefit for those looking for non-permanent or transitional living arrangements.

## The Bad

On the less favorable side, the complex has faced criticism for apparent neglect concerning pest control, with one review indicating issues with silverfish and ants during the summer months. The shared facilities, such as the laundry room, were also a point of concern, with users mentioning a lack of sanitization in common-use areas. These points suggest that while initial impressions of cleanliness are strong, there may be a lapse in ongoing maintenance, which could negatively impact the living experience over time.

Furthermore, unfavorable comments touched upon the property's handling of packages, with reports of parcels often being misplaced. This, coupled with dissatisfaction regarding the high rent that some residents don't find justified, underscores a sense of discontent with the management's attention to residents' needs and the perceived value being provided.

## The Ugly

Safety and security emerge as significant pain points in the user reviews for Hideaway Apartments. With alarming accounts of finding used needles and other paraphernalia on the property, some residents have raised serious concerns about the environment and lack of an effective response from management. One disturbing review mentioned witnessing illegal substance use within the apartment complex's parking lot, which understandably led to discomfort and ultimately, the decision to move.

Issues with pest infestations and reports of black mold present further health and environmental red flags that have severely tainted the living experience for some tenants. The absence of a timely and effective response from the property management team to such grave issues has left these tenants with a negative impression, often leading to strong recommendations against choosing Hideaway Apartments as a place to live.
