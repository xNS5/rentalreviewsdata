Son-Rise Property Management, based in Bellingham, WA, has a diverse array of opinions from its tenants, captured in varying reviews online. The average rating stands at a low 1.9 from a total of 29 user reviews. This article synthesizes these user reviews and aims to provide a nuanced picture of the company's services, reflecting both the good and the not-so-good aspects.

## The Good
There are a handful of tenants who have had positive experiences with Son-Rise Property Management. For example, some users have highlighted the company's helpful and understanding approach to tenant issues and their readiness to address problems promptly. Gratitude was expressed towards the property management for rectifying mistakes and for not being keen on nickel and diming residents over small issues.

Some tenants also appreciated the company's hands-off approach, giving them personal space and only intervening when necessary. Happier reviews mentioned receiving back the majority of the security depositâ€”citing honest behavior that stands in contrast with other property management companies in the area that may attempt to unfairly withhold deposits.

## The Great
In the case of positive feedback, tenants have emphasized the rapid response to maintenance requests for critical appliances, reflecting a level of attentiveness to renter needs. Furthermore, courteous and helpful interactions with staff members on the phone and in-person were also noted, contributing to an overall satisfactory renting experience.

Property management staff, when they do engage, is described as being friendly and easy to work with, and some have reported a smooth renting and move-out process, with full deposits returned except for nominal cleaning fees. A couple of tenants have also praised specific members of the Son-Rise team for their professionalism in handling listings and looking after properties effectively.

## The Bad
However, the majority of user reviews lean unfavorably towards Son-Rise Property Management, depicting a less-than-ideal situation. Several tenants have reported problems such as unaddressed maintenance issues, including unresolved water leaks leading to mold growth. Communication appears to be a recurring issue, with allegations of avoidance and neglect when it comes to serious concerns voiced by tenants.

Others have expressed dissatisfaction with the condition of properties at the time of move-in, pointing out cleanliness issues, damage, and a lack of routine maintenance. Charges for lawn maintenance and cleaning upon move-out were also cited as points of contention, with several tenants feeling that deductions from security deposits were unreasonable.

## The Ugly
Diving deeper into the negatives, certain reviews paint a concerning picture of the company's property management practices. Accusations of disrespect and condescension towards tenants, particularly younger ones, are a repeating theme, suggesting a tarnished reputation in terms of tenant relations. The courtesy expected by some tenants, in this case, seemed to fall by the wayside, with complaints of rude treatment from front-desk staff and disenchanting move-out procedures.

The issue of security deposits is particularly prominent, where stories of high and sometimes questionable charges against deposits are shared. Instances of lackluster responses to urgent maintenance requests have aggravated tenant frustrations, culminating in a pervasive sentiment of neglect and mishandling.
