## The Good

Tenants have often praised Daylight Properties for their responsive and compassionate team. One user review highlighted how the Daylight team exceeded expectations by promptly addressing every concern from the mundane to the more serious maintenance issues, reflecting their dedication to the community. The variety of residential listings, including unique and charming options, has also been appreciated, alongside their easy-to-use tenant portal and communication system. Tenants feel that these traits embody the company's commitment to providing a top-notch living experience.

Furthermore, the friendly and professional demeanor of the staff, both in the office and maintenance crew, has been a consistent theme in positive feedback. Tenants have reported their problems being taken seriously, with quick and effective solutions provided. For example, tenants who requested apartment modifications, even if perceived as minor, were delighted to find the management willing to cater to their needs, improving their living space and overall satisfaction.

## The Great

Daylight Properties has also been commended for their excellent management of commercial spaces. Business tenants specifically lauded the company for their swift response to any issues and their assistance in creating a vibrant community within the building. The staff, from the main office to maintenance, is heralded for their efforts to not just address problems but also proactively work to prevent them, contributing to the thriving atmosphere of the business premises they manage.

The maintenance crew, who operate under the ethos of Daylight Properties, receive individual acclaim for their skilled, polite, and efficient service. Whether it's upkeep or renovation, tenants reported that work is conducted swiftly, with consideration for the tenant's schedule and preferences, which marks Daylight Properties as not just a property manager but a valuable partner to both residential and commercial tenants.

## The Bad

However, not all user reviews paint a rosy picture. There have been reports of poor management decisions, such as the alleged incident where a tenant faced an unjust fee due to a clerical error by Daylight Properties. This kind of experience fosters distrust and frustration among tenants, particularly when it involves financial discrepancies that remain unaddressed or deflected by the management.

Some customers also expressed dissatisfaction about communication lapses. Although some user reviews mention prompt communication, others found it challenging to engage with the management and felt neglected when their concerns or inquiries went unanswered. These instances of subpar communication and customer service are significant drawbacks that potential tenants might consider before engaging with Daylight Properties.

## The Ugly

In some extreme cases, users reported particularly distressing experiences. One review detailed how a tenant encountered unauthorized entry into their unit, which was justified by the company as a response to an emergency. This has raised questions about privacy and the strict observance of state laws governing tenant rights. Additionally, there have been accounts of unsavory interactions with staff and difficulties faced by elderly tenants, like the refusal to provide carts for carrying items, which some perceive as a lack of empathy towards residents with mobility issues.

Moreover, prospective tenants have faced troubles even before signing a lease. One review described a potential tenant's struggle to even view a property, suggesting a lack of organization and a dismissive attitude towards potential clients. Such experiences tarnish the reputation of Daylight Properties and indicate areas that urgently require improvement.

In conclusion, Daylight Properties appears to be a company with moments of excellence in property management as well as instances of significant underperformance. This article seeks to offer a balanced viewpoint, presenting the multifaceted experiences of tenants extracted from user reviews. It's important for prospective tenants to carefully consider the varied experiences before making a decision.
