      "review": "I've lived here for almost a year now and I have really enjoyed it. I share a 1 bedroom unit with my fiance on the second floor. We like how many windows it has and the beautiful trees surrounding us on all sides, and also we like the wrap-around kitchen with the kitchen island and breakfast bar. Best of all, we don't share walls with any neighbors! Each unit is separated from the others by a walkway or a small bridge. The only negative is that you get a fair amount of street noise from Bakerview. Even so, it's one of the best places I've rented.",
