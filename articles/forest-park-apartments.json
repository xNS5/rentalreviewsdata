        "review": "I have been a tenant at Forest Park Apts for over 20 years.  I have never paid my rent late except for this month - I was 2 days late because I simply forgot.  They put a late notice on my door for the rent plus a $50 late fee.  I immediately went to the office and dropped off my check and a letter indicating that I didn't believe I deserved to pay the late fee considering my record and long tenancy.  Royce Group sent me a letter stating I still owed $50 so I called them (Michelle Saab) thinking that perhaps they didn't get my letter begging off the late fee.  That was not the case.  She did get my letter but didn't care.  She said 30 other people were late, too.  I replied that I know for a fact no one has lived there longer than me - not even close - and that maybe I should consider giving my notice.  Her reply was \"okay.\"  \n\nA Complete lack of respect and loyalty to a very long time tenant that has never paid rent late!  Really??\n\n\nSHAME ON YOU!!",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>User reviews highlight some positive experiences at Forest Park Apartments, particularly noting the size and interior quality of the apartments. One reviewer praised the size of the one-bedroom unit, mentioning it as nicely sized and quiet inside. Such comments reflect well on the apartment's living conditions. Residents also seem to appreciate the new management's efforts since the property transitioned to new ownership, with one resident even noting a \"wonderful experience with the management\" and no substantial problems to report. Additionally, the responsiveness and friendliness of the maintenance team were commended, adding to the positive aspects mentioned in the good reviews.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>The improvements made by the new company managing Forest Park Apartments have not gone unnoticed, as some reviewers have witnessed significant updates to the apartments, leading them to describe their living space as beautiful. This level of investment in the property suggests a commitment to providing residents with a pleasant living environment. Furthermore, the feedback mentioning the promptness of maintenance services points to a management team that is responsive and attentive to the needs of the tenants, which is an essential quality for a good property management company.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, not all residents have had positive experiences, with some expressing dissatisfaction over the management's handling of fiscal matters. One resident mentioned an issue with not receiving a refund, suggesting a lack of attention to financial responsibilities by the property management. Concerning maintenance, the replacement of appliances, such as washers, with used and dirty units, has been a source of frustration for some tenants, indicating a possible lack in the quality control of maintenance work.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The situation at Forest Park Apartments has evidently been dire for some, as indicated by numerous reviews. Notably, the company has been accused of not being transparent about the proximity of a methadone clinic to the property, which has been a cause of concern for potential and current residents. Long-standing tenants have also reported feeling a lack of appreciation and respect, with one 20+ year tenant experiencing what they felt was an unjust late fee and a perceived indifference from management when they voiced this concern. Such feedback underscores the sentiment that the company may not be adequately valuing tenant loyalty or addressing individual circumstances with the necessary empathy and discretion.</p></section>"
