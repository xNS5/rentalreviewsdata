        "review": "At first this place seemed super great. Everyone was super nice and welcoming, the neighbors are also very sweet. However, after 3 months of living here I see a lot of issues. The parking lots are situated very weirdly, tandem parking spots are back to back, making it very difficult to get out when the spots are full, and there's no guests parking. There was a lot of damage to the cabinets in my unit, and they pretty much told me they didn't want to spend the money to replace them. (I've gotten several splinters now) my front door locks were screwed up from the start, so were all the windows and sliding door. They were all very cloudy on the INSIDE and can't be cleaned away. It looks horrendous tbh. Maintenance is a bit odd.  When you send in a request, there's no place to ask for a time. They just show up unannounced within a day or 2 at any time. It's very hard to do if you have a busy college life like me. The office hours aren't posted on their website, and every time I've called about something. It's taken almost a week for a response. I wouldn't say completely knock this place. But if you see anything you aren't happy about, make sure to tell them within the first couple of days of living here because it will not be addressed unless you complain a lot. Haha. I've enjoyed it here, but I do wish the damages were fixed before I even moved in. Especially bc they took longer cleaning and getting the place ready for me than they originally said they would.",

        "review": "They just increased the price of laundry by almost a dollar per load without notifying tenants in any way. The landlady and her assistant do not answer your calls or respond to maintenance requests in a timely manner, if they even bother. Overall not the worst place to live, but clearly poorly managed.",

        "review": "This is most certainly a college apartment building, so I am going in to this review with that first. It's not going to be magical, nor does it have all of the amenities you might want from a high quality apartment building. No in-unit washer/dryers, just a laundry room. The landlords are fantastic, as long as you act like a civil human being and don't destroy their property or bother the neighbors. They are strict about their rules, and for good reason. Occasional party apartments, but they tend to come and go, and the landlords are always happy to shut it down if it's gotten too loud and rowdy. Apartments are decent quality, nothing you can't work with for the price. If you're tired of living in the dorms or you just want something simple, this is it. Assigned parking spaces (one per bedroom of the apartment) and it's well enforced. No pets, aside from fish or support/ service animals. Laundry is coin-op, but there's usually room so I've never had any delays waiting for a machine to free up.",

        "review": "The parking situation isn't great or even good. It's difficult to visit people who live there because of the lack of visitor parking and the small amount of 15 min parking almost always being full. The resident parking isn't great or even good either because they made the majority of the spots double parking and you have to shuffle cars around to get in and out. They also just don't have the most space for exiting when it is designed the way it is.",

        "review": "EDIT: this review is based on experience with the previous landlord. It's since been taken over by Apex/PTLA, so YMMV.\n\nApartments are perfectly nice, nothing special. Spacious enough for me, and all the given appliances work fine. No in-home laundry, but there's an on-site laundromat. Lived here for three years, and never had an issue with the managers -- they're nice people who solve any problems you might have with your apartment.",

        "review": "BIG OOF Oh this was just lovely. The landlords are name Dee and Rob because they will try to rob you and at best they would get a D grade in customer service. We had agreed on a move in date (this was done two months before said date) which was great and made our deposit/hold of about 900 dollars for a three bedroom unit. Two weeks before move in we get a call saying that they no longer know when the apartment will be ready! Lots of repairs to do and whatnot. Lame but whatever. Stuff happens and Covid. Things are difficult right now. Finally three (3) days before original move in I get a call saying we can move in the day after school started and two days after the originally agreed upon date. There was a catch though. We were told (not asked) we had to put in a work order for the very large sliding glass door onto the back porch (no cover from the rain) because Dee couldnt get it REPLACED before move in. Also the carpets would still be wet from cleaning and we would be signing our lease before we even stepped foot inside. Its a no from me dawg! Thankfully my roommates and I only pretend to be stupid and had found another place the week prior that was move in ready and had this magical thing known as e-mail and a website where we could read our lease and communicate with the owners anytime! Have I mentioned this place only use phone and paper? They think it is 1960 and talk like it is too. Lots of derogatory and disrespectful comments about Native Americans (Dee used a different phrase) and the LGBT community during our maybe one hour of interaction (I am a member of neither of these groups but my roommate is Bi). Just totally unnecessary and unprofessional. Anyways thank the lord that Dee pretends to follow that we found this other place as based on reviews on apartment reviews .com it sounds like we were far from the first people they have tried to rip off and disrespect like that. My dad was going to be my co-signer and she would only listen to him after he mentioned he was an Army veteran. Way to respect the troops! Anyways we hated this experience so much we didnt even try to get our 900 dollars back and are much happier at our place three blocks down the road which is much better maintained and believe it or not, the exact same price for a three bedroom. Also this place smells like cigarettes(I have smoked quite a bit myself but dude, not everyone needs to share) and the paint is peeling everywhere. The laundry is coin based and you have to walk out in the cold and rain during the winter to get there. Sad!",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>The Property Inglewood Apartments has garnered some positive feedback from users who appreciate the on-site management's friendliness and approachability. Many tenants highlight the great relationship they have with the managers, describing them as caring and attentive. For example, one review notes that tenants are treated like family and are allowed to hold small gatherings as long as they're respectful of the noise levels.</p><p>In addition, the apartments themselves have been described as reasonably spacious and adequately equipped with necessary appliances. The location is convenient, especially for students attending nearby schools, making these apartments a popular choice. Clear advantages like assigned parking spaces per bedroom help mitigate some of the parking-related concerns that many users have brought up.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Many users appreciate the affordability of Property Inglewood Apartments, considering the overall living experience provided. While the quality of the apartments may not be luxurious, several occupants expressed satisfaction with the value for money, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious individuals. User reviews specifically mention that the landlords are proactive and responsive regarding maintenance issues, solving problems usually within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>The good management practices have encouraged a more cohesive community vibe, with residents enjoying the general atmosphere and quiet environment. It's noted that while the buildings are typical of college accommodations, they meet the needs of many students looking for somewhere simple yet functional to live. However, some users acknowledge that prospective tenants should be aware of the property's limitations and manage their expectations accordingly.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><pDespite the positives, several significant issues have been reported by users. A common complaint pertains to the parking situation, which many consider poorly designed and insufficient for the number of residents and their guests. The tandem parking arrangement creates problems, forcing residents to shuffle cars around to get in and out, making it challenging for visitors to find parking as well.</p><pAnother pain point mentioned by users is the lack of timely communication and responses from management. Many tenants reported feeling frustrated with the delayed replies to maintenance requests and phone calls. Users expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in management practices, particularly regarding increases in laundry expenses without prior notification, adding a layer of dissatisfaction with overall property management.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pThere have also been alarming reported experiences that resonate negatively with former and current tenants. Some users have mentioned issues like encountering bedbugs in their units, leading to significant discomfort and concern regarding general hygiene and pest control management. Such serious complaints can leave lasting impressions on prospective tenants, creating an image of the property that may deter potential renters.</p><pMoreover, one user shared a particularly distressing experience regarding mismanagement related to lease agreements, leading to last-minute changes and unprofessional treatment. This not only reflects poor customer service but signals a deep-rooted issue with the management's communication and operational skills, which can be detrimental in a rental environment. The convergence of these incidents paints a troubling picture, suggesting that the property requires urgent attention in both maintenance and management practices.</p></section>"
