          "text": "Hi Nathaniel - we're sorry to hear that you didn't like the electronic locks for the building. We have installed a battery backup system that should allow phone app users to still have access to the building, but it does not apply to use of the fob. We will continue to look at and improve our system in the coming months and years to ensure that everyone has the best experience with the electronic lock system as possible."

        "review": "500 square is a nice place to live and is in a great location. I have a slight problem with that when me and my roommates moved in, there was a lot of damages to the apartment that wasnt taken care of prior to our move in. One of the biggest damages was a dent on one of the bathroom doors. We could also see that someone tried to do a paint match but it didnt work out so great and there is multiple dents and scratched to the walls. Another issue is that its hard to get contact with the onsite manager during their said business hours. Besides that, 500 square is an ideal place to live.",

        "review": "The parking lot is very crowded and not very safe. The apartment is on a steep hill and the property management decided to block off the safest and most convenient exit/entrance for the parking lot. To the best of my knowledge it was only to block non-residents from driving in the parking lot. I never noticed a problem with that before, this is my second year living at 500 Square. It has only made the access to parking more difficult and dangerous.",
        "owner_response": {
          "text": "Thank you for the feedback, Bella. Im sorry to hear that you have had difficulty with the parking lot here. Our goal is to always provide as much parking as possible for our residents in our reserved parking lot and make sure that only residents are utilizing their parking spaces. If you have specific concerns we are more than happy to address them with you when you get a chance to call or talk in our onsite office. "

        "review": "I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately its just not what it claims to be. The building itself is pretty nice, you can tell it was made to look good but not actually be of good quality but I can get over that. My main issue I have here is the lack of management presence and the lack of security/safety. There is almost never a manager on sight, even during 11am-2pm when they are said to be here. There is an entrance/exit that anyone can use to get into the building by sliding your hand through the bars, making it super easy for anyone to enter the apartment building without being a tenant or a guest. I messaged the manager about this 5 days ago and never got a response. I also sent a follow up message yesterday and still no response. I have friends living in this apartment, and when they moved in they didnt even have a functioning dish washer because it was missing key pieces. They didnt have any mirrors in the bathroom either. Yet, they were still paying full price of the rent regardless of not having a fully equipped apartment. When I moved into my unit, there weee already scuffs and dings - specifically around the kitchen. Not to mention there was sawdust in the cupboards. The apartment units themselves are beautiful in my opinion but lack functionality. For example, there is only one drawer in the kitchen in my unit (which is a 2-bed 1.5-bath) - and the drawer cant even be opened because the fridge blocks it from opening fully. Similar issue in the bathroom, if the door is open you cannot open the drawers. I think this apartment could be really great with some improvements but it definitely has a way to go.",

          "text": "Hi Sonja,\nThanks for taking the time to give some feed back. I am sorry to hear you are not satisfied with the property. Regarding management, we have an onsite manager who is in the office from 9-1 every day, you are welcome to drop in and discuss any issues you have when you are available. We have not received any message from you about the door, through there are plans to address that issue right away. In the future please send messages to manager@500square.com or call the office at 360-209-5313 so we can address any concerns you may have. We try to address any work orders as fast as possible and we apologize if anything was missed before you moved in. Rent credit and gift cards were given to tenants who brought up any issues to management and any tenants who didn't have mirrors right away. Please let us know if the future if you have further issues so they can be addressed by management."

To name a few, the move in date was pushed back two days and we were given less than a days notice, the apartment was still covered in sawdust once we were able to move in, the toilets werent working, the dishwasher wasnt fully installed, mirrors werent installed until weeks after moving in, and now we are dealing with not having electricity for the past 72 hours.",

There were some tight construction deadlines, so we apologize if anything was missed by the builders before move in. Your issue with the electricity being out in part of your unit is being scheduled with the electrician and will be addressed right away, as was confirmed earlier today. That you for your patience as we get the electrician out to address the issue. Thank you for your feedback, and please feel free to voice any further concerns to us and we'll do our best to address any remaining issues."

        "review": "Nice apartments but poor management as far as wait times, parking, and construction goes. This place was supposed to be finished in May 2022 and is still not finished. Its a sunny afternoon and I have my window shut because of all the noise they make all the time. My friends in this building didnt have MIRRORS in their bathrooms until this week. They moved into this place in the first week of September. Also the prison gate door is so deafening that some people just dont close it, which is a security issue.",

Our management team has addressed these noise issues with the construction company, and we anticipate less noise from them going forward, especially as the construction on the property is nearing completion.\n\nIn regards to parking, we are aware of the issues you mentioned in your review and are working to improve these issues. In the meantime, if someone is parked in your spot, please contact management with a description of the vehicle, and the license plate number, so we can have the car removed immediately. We thank you for your understanding in regards to this issue as we sort out this issue on the property.\n\nThank you for letting us know about the noise being caused by the closing of the metal gate, and the safety issue its causing. Weve fixed this since being alerted to the issue. If youre still experiencing this issue, or see the gate left open, please contact us as soon as possible, as safety is of the utmost important at our property.\n\nThat is correct about the missing mirrors for some of our tenants, but we have fixed that issue and those tenants all should have mirrors at this point. We issued a rent credit to compensate those tenants for the inconvenience.\n\nThank you for your feedback, and please feel free to voice any further concerns to us and we'll do our best to address any remaining issues."
