        "review": "So far this place has been great. Close to town but only next to a church and fields. Tucked away a little so you dont have the city life feeling while being close to all the amenities.  Soundproofing needs work next to the stairs in the rooms and floors.  Wish there was a elevator for the people on the higher floors.  Stairwell is I closed which is nice.\nThere are security cameras, lock doors to enter building to access stairs and your apartment so thats nice.  Dog park and a playground for the kids.  I do wish people would use the playground but they seem to enjoy letting their dogs poop in the playground where kids play and leave it.\n\nAll in all I enjoy it.  Nice updated apartment.",

        "review": "Apex Property Management announced AFTER raising rent for the all tenants, that construction of a brand new apartment complex is happening on site. Tremezzo is supposed to be dog friendly, but the outside 'dog area' is not meant for any dogs that need actual exercise. And no areas to walk unless you want to get hit by passing cars. No storage in any of the apartments besides the kitchen pantry, and they claim that the apartments are sound proof, but I've gotten complaints for not doing anything excessive (just living a normal dog mom life). Wouldn't recommend...",

        "review": "Very in your business property. Tenants spy on you, take photos of you inside your apartment to send to the management and fail to clean up after their dogs. The management constantly checks up on you and the entire time Ive lived here there has been some kind of construction happening underneath my building, pretty hard to sleep when you have a tight work schedule. They only warned us for one day of the construction, too. If youre looking for a place thats isolated and quiet and lets you be to yourself, this is NOT a place for you and your family/ friends.",

        "review": "The property is beautiful, great floor plans, and very nice in unit, however definitely some features not clearly communicated by any property management company that runs this property (Apex previously, Landmark currently). Two things you should consider before moving here is the lack of an elevator. While it is common for older buildings to have no elevator, it would seem that a newer building (built in 2017) of this size (40 units a building) would at least have an elevator for ADA reasons as each flight consists of 15 stairs. Second, while the property does not offer any guest parking (which is fairly common), they also fail to communicate that there is also no street / neighborhood parking within a reasonable distance for a guest to visit any tenant. Mind you, this property has 3 buildings, around 120 units, and there are no options for guest to park, utterly making it extremely difficult to have visitors. While this may be intentional, I doubt that any tenant intends to live somewhere and have no visitors.\n\nSince signing my lease in February, the property has changed management companies, and after an extremely bumpy transition and lack of transparency its unfortunately left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth. However, I encourage you to please take these  things into consideration before you choose to make this your home.",
