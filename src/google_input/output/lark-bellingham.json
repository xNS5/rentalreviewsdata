      "review": "I lived here back in 2022 for 3 months while subletting a room from a college student for the summer. I enjoyed living there for the short time I was there, other than the neighbors we had that would break glass, leave trash, blast music in the hall and scream at our door. Filed a complaint, and surprise! Lark did nothing. Fast forward 2 whole years to a few weeks ago, I received a letter in the mail from a collections agency saying that I owed $1000+ to Lark, and they had sent them after me. 2 whole years later, and they realized they never filed in the system that I had turned my keys in and moved out. I continued to get emails from them saying I owed money but it had the original tenants name attached, so I thought nothing of it and that it was a mistake. How disorganized do you have to be to forget to mark someone as moved out-especially when the original tenant had moved back in and they checked? Getting contacted by a collections agency for money that I never owed is the most ridiculous thing ever. After contacting Lark, I was told I would get a call back that day after she checked some things-never did. Called back the following day and she mentioned she forgot. Thankfully she updated the system and contacted the collection agency to drop the charges because they werent accurate. Unnecessary headache and stress due to a miscommunication from a place that I was already spending a lot of money to live at. While I really did like living here, this place is unorganized and will likely screw you over, like most other bad reviews have stated. Stay away from this place, itll come back to haunt you.",

      "review": "Parents:  Are you thinking of place your child here? There are pros, but consider carefully the cons. While these apartments look good, and seem to have all the right answers, I've run into a real problem with my child. And I'm 300 miles away, so I have hard time resolving these things. My child has had 3 different roommates. All of them have been disasters in their own special way. And I don't get the feeling the Lark really has a plan. As matter fact, it would seem that Lark views this as \"you\" problem not a \"them\" problem.\n\nSo, if you child has an excellent history with somebody, and they are certain they will make a good team and be responsible roommates, then Lark can work. If not, find someplace else.\n\nAs of today, I hate Lark and I will always hate them. They have failed me and my child in grotesque fashion.",

WiFi is decent but I wouldnt trust it if youre a competitive gamer or twitch streamer. Water condensates on the window easily so you have to watch out for black mold. My closet smelled like and had cat litter still before moving in. The parking is an absolute disaster. Instead of trying to find solutions they made more reserved spots to make you pay more for something that should be standard. Having to worry if you can park at home, or if you have to park somewhere else where you may be towed is ridiculous. Make a deal with a local business? Extend the parking lot? Add more visitor spots? I am moving out next year.\n\nGood temporary place to live for school, wouldnt live here long term.",

      "review": "DO NOT LIVE AT LARK!!! Lark is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to actually living here. There are not enough parking spaces for all of the residents and many constantly have to park outside the gate and walk home in the cold and risk getting their cars towed. Lark also LOVES to tow cars, they will tow visitors for parking in resident spots even though there are on SIX visitor spots for the entire complex of over hundreds of apartments. They also send insane amounts of emails, its boarder-lining on harassment at this point. I moved in on September 19th and by the end of the month they were already sending me emails about renewing my lease for next year (i still get these CONSTANTLY) and how quickly apartment spots are going even though i signed my lease in June of this year so they clearly are not selling out that quick. There are also apartment inspections where staff thinks its appropriate to enter my apartment without permission and without anyone in the home and touch and move my personal items. Staff is also very strange about packages and picking them up, i have been denied my package before because i was too early and they werent ready yet even though i knew my package was in the office. Also the lark shuttle is the worst, the hours are inconsistent and were not communicated to residents, and the pickups are constantly late making me late to class. Also the bus driver is insane, she yells at drivers, honks at them, swerves, slams on her breaks etc. One time she hit the breaks so hard the kid in the very back of the bus flew forward and fell on the ground (yes he got hurt), the shuttle feels dangerous sometimes. ALSO the shuttle does not run consistently, it was not running for an entire week not too long ago, and they constantly stop running it in the middle of the day leaving students on campus.\nAll in all the amenities are nice but it is not worth the stress of parking and getting harassed by staff via email and in person. DONT LIVE AT LARK, SAVE URSELF THE TRAUMA.",

Ive had 3 packages stolen so far and each time I go in to talk to them about it they give me the number to the police and say theres nothing they can do. NOTHING THEY CAN DO?

      "review": "My roommate and I are so happy we chose Lark Bellingham as our college housing solution.\n\nThe location to WWU is great. It's right on the bus line and there's a Lark shuttle to and from campus. The apartments are spacious, fairly soundproof, and include ample internet, as well as, a washer and dryer. Most important, the apartments are well-maintained and affordable, especially considering the extra amenities. There's a 24hr fitness center, resident lounge, game room, study center, sand volleyball, ping-pong tables, and (our favorite) outdoor firepits. Occasionally we are surprised with  invitations to Lark hosted community events. Best of all - they're pet friendly!\n\nThe office folks are amazing! They made the application process simple and straight forward, have quickly addressed any of our concerns, and helped make move-in day joyful and uncomplicated. They went above and beyond in helping us select an apartment that would meet our disability challenges. They daily work through package deliveries quickly and provide us with timely notices for pickup. The maintenance team is friendly, keeps the grounds clean, and is diligent in keeping up with garbage control and recycling (which is no easy task in a college housing setting).\n\nYes, you will see less starry reviews (mostly around parking issues), but those issues are easily fixed with early lease planning and reserving a paid parking space. In our experience, Lark has done a great job with parking enforcement.\n\nIf anything, Lark can improve it's shuttle service by adding a second driver, but overall, they do a great job of alerting tenants when the shuttle is out of service so that WWU students can plan accordingly and make use of the bus line.",

      "review": "The maintenance team when I lived there from 2019-2020 was the biggest group of disrespectful kids I'd ever experienced for apartment maintenance. I don't expect any maintenance person to actually provide good customer service, but they're always decent people who treat me like a normal person. The arrogance and disrespect I got from this crew was disgusting. They had an attitude of not wanting to do the jobs they signed up for.\n\nMy dishwasher and garbage disposal was jammed/broken so our sink was filling up with water when we ran the dishwasher and was almost full when we stopped it. We tried to see if it was jammed but the water was up to our elbows. So we scooped as much as we could out and waited. The sink was dirty and had dishes in it. Maintenance comes in to fix it, finishes and shows drain is draining, and as he's leaving says, \"You need to clean your apartment,\" in the most judgmental and rude tone and leaves before we can reply. Hard to do my dishes when the sink is backing up when I run the dishwasher and no water will drain if I try to use the sink.\n\nI never called maintenance unless it was related to water damage or leaks after that. So disrespectful and judgemental. I hope the crew has changed since then, but I doubt it from what friends who live there say.\n\nIn my own opinion, they're here to make profit and overcharge college students who can't find housing in time and/or didn't make the on-campus housing lottery. Slumlords. At least, at the very very bare minimum, provide *average* customer service and don't say whatever comes to your mind when you're robbing college kids blind.",

(I even had to postpone moving in as they told me they wanted to clean the units) Stains and other miscellaneous items like hooks and pins were left around the room when I moved in. The drains to both the bathroom sink and shower didn't work upon moving in. Both of them filled up with water when used. I filed a maintenance request about the issue, only for it to be marked resolved a few days later with no action done by Lark or it's maintenance staff.\n\nI additionally didn't have internet access from when I moved in till late November. I would continually contact Lark about the issue and was always told they would email me back with a status update as they had to do stuff on their end that I had no control over. Throughout the entire time I had received none of the emails they said they were going to send to me.\n\nAt one point I had water pooling on my ceiling (this was at a point in time where we were experiencing heavy rainstorms and I lived on the top floor). I called Lark about the issue and was told that the general manager would immediately come over to do inspections. I had waited over an hour, and he still had not showed up. I recall to ask for a status update, to be told that he already left for the day. When contacted about potential damage to their property, the management at Lark does not care about resolving or inspecting it.\n\nI would not recommend this place, and I advise anyone reading to avoid this place.

The front office is very unorganized and arent very helpful with getting you information. Please read the whole lease 5x before signing because theyll not let you out and theres a lot of things most people probably wouldnt agree too hidden in there. They also over charge and nickel and dime young college students as much as they can. They are currently trying to charge me 500+ dollars for a carpet stain that was left by the resident previous to me. I have sent an email from their leasing office where they have acknowledged that its not from me and its not my responsibility, yet right now they are refusing to answer my emails and take the charge off. They also charge a 75 dollar cleaning for dust left on dressers and 50 dollars for what woulda taken a napkin to wipe off. It comes off as a complete scam which is a shame because the units are nice. (UPDATE) after many emails they did correct my balance from 500 to 58 dollars.",

I diligently cleaned my apt after moving out at the beginning of my last month there, and on top of the already paid damage deposit and pet deposit they still ramped me for another couple hundred bucks.

      "review": "TLDR: STAY AWAY FROM LARK.\nThis is gonna be long.\nAt first living at Lark was nice, the only real issue seemed to be the lack of decent parking. My roommate and I quickly found out that not only was there not enough parking for all of the residents at lark to even park inside the gates, but calling and trying to report cars without passes accomplished nothing. Trying to get any help from the office accomplished nothing. The only thing that was handled quickly and efficiently was adding my cat onto my lease. Other than that the office staff has been unhelpful and just plain rude at times.\nI made at least half a dozen noise complaint calls in the middle of the night that never seemed to do anything before finding out that they DEFINITELY werent doing anything when I received a call and voicemail saying that they talked to my neighbors for the first time about the noise and next time I needed to just go talk to them instead since they were so polite and understanding. (Not sure where in my lease it says I need to uphold their quiet hours, but I digress).\nWhen my roommate and I went in with a friend to switch to a three bedroom for next year (we already renewed to keep the lower rent and are stuck in our lease) they told us what we needed to do and it seemed super simple. But we were unable to go online and request each other as roommates, my friend wasnt receiving any emails from them about her lease, and for the next couple months all three of us received multiple calls about who we wanted as roommates for next year. Each time we told them the names of our roommates and that wed been into the office several times now and been called even more about this. They told us they would make a note of it and it would be changed. They either dont communicate in the office at all, or theyre all not doing their job correctly. It shouldnt be that hard to write down the names of three people living in an apartment.\nTrying to get maintenance is a pain. Most recently we tried to get some help for the carpenter ants that are invading our apartment because we live on the first floor and our door has visible cracks and holes in the seal around it. We were told that it was OUR LIVING CONDITIONS that attracted and caused the ants and they were not going to come and even look at the door or offer any help other than sorry, its probably your fault. A couple times they havent bothered to come at all, marked the request as completed and sent a survey on how the maintenance was.\nSTAY AWAY FROM LARK. Its an overpriced, inconvenient, and incredibly stressful place to live.",

      "review": "Most disorganized place ever. They will pester you to renew from day one. Then run a rather scammy tactic of saying they rented your room for the new lease term, despite giving a written renewal offer giving you well in to August to renew and keep your same room .Then they send you a renewal confirmation and a new lease when you have not at any time said you are renewing. Not to mention the constant calls from Lani about if you plan to renew. Seriously girl, calm down and stop walking around acting like you are the building manager when you are not. One time at the Thanksgiving dinner, Lani told maintenance they were not allowed a plate of food. Even though there were tons of leftovers! Just downright sad.\n\nThe place is noisy AF. Dog poop everywhere because some people with big dogs don't pick up. Maintenance is the only good part of this place. If the front office staff were as efficient as the maintenance staff,  this place would be alot better. Don't be fooled by the free coffee and a gym. The coffee machine is always down and the gym is always full. Also, whats up with the name changes for the place?\n\nEdit to add: Somebody was broken in to and Lark sent a memo trying to play it off as somebody accidentally walking in to the wrong apartment. Check out the infamous video of the naked tenant that made it in to the newspapers all the way in England. Also, their old security guard told me a story of how a young female tenant was locked out of her place and he tried to book her a hotel room for the night with his credit card. And a charming story of another security guard caught jerking it in the clubhouse!\n\nThere is a homeless camp in the wooded area around the site. You can see the garbage, graffiti and homeless people coming and going right in front of Lark. It's scary at night if you walk to and from Fred Meyer or the bus stop.",

      "review": "This place sounded too good to be true when I signed my lease last year during their huge advertising push on campus. And, it was. NXNW was not the worst place to live but it's also not what they say it will be. When I signed, they said that they would have at least monthly social gatherings like Taco Tuesday, which failed to reoccur and attract residents. The apartment is nice but is not the best place to entertain (the courtyard is suitable for entertaining). In the bedroom, you're going to need to get a mattress topper for the provided mattress, and the desk does not come with any drawers (for being \"student housing\" you would think that they would take into account that we are students who use desks). And by far the worst part is (you guessed it) the parking. They did just add a total of seven new spots! WOW! I spent the majority of my school year last year driving around trying to find a spot to park (one time I spent an hour driving around the parking lot). I wish I was exaggerating. I would come home and drive around for at least 20-30 minutes looking for a space to park. They told me to park at Fred Meyer or the park and ride. Well, Fred Meyer tickets cars and I did not feel comfortable walking from the park and ride in the dark back to my apartment. It is a safety concern when students line all of the fire lanes of the complex, thank goodness there wasn't any emergencies or fires or that would have definitely ended poorly. If you live here next year, the parking will always be a struggle. So many people have talked to them about this issue and they have been \"working on it\" since fall 2016. I suggest finding someplace else to live. They will get you in with all of the perks that they offer, which are great, but not worth it in the end. Also the wifi does not work well, it really only works decent if your sitting next to your box :) Save yourself the hassle and find another place to call home. Come to NXNW for one of the parties, but this is not the best place to live long term. You can find a great apartment for a much better price and conditions than this place. Good luck and happy apartment hunting!",

Do not place your child in this complex unless you have absolutely no other choice. Their lease is designed to completely screw the tenant. You will be obligated for the entirety of your lease regardless of what circumstances may arise necessitating an early departure. Additionally the lease must be for an entire year even if your child is coming home during the summer. We were charged $250 for a television set that the larks maintenance people removed from the apartment since we had our own TV. When we put in a request to have the TV returned, the lark claimed that they had no record of the original TV being removed and therefore were going to charge us to replace it. Furniture and accommodations are cheaply made and not built to last for any serious stretch of time. If your child is in a two bedroom apartment and the roommate in the other bedroom moves out, the lark will randomly assign your child a new roommate. The entire complex is run by college kids with no experience no wisdom and no ability to truly assist you. I would not recommend the lark to anyone!",

      "review": "Reserved spots are not enforced at all. I have spent an extra $30 a month, totaling close to $500, to have the same parking rights as people who do not pay a premium for parking. It is unfair. Management claimed their new solution to parking (make almost every spot reserved and allow people who pay the premium to park in these spots, allow residents who do not pay extra to park in resident spots, and guests in guest spots). This solution works in theory, yet due to the lack of proper enforcement (also something that was promised to become better) it is a useless solution.\n\nAside from the parking issue, quite a number of things have caused concern.\n\nFirst, there was a large 20+ foot fire in the complex, management never notified any residents. I am sure most residents were unaware it ever happened. Although it was a recycling bin that caught fire, it was within 10-15 feet of a building and could have easily spread. This is a large safety concern that I feel should have warranted notifications to the residents. Just to note, this was a cardboard recycling bin fire on a rainy day, thus it was likely arson.\n\nMost of the amenities offered are unavailable half of the time. The coffee machine often needs repair, the printer runs out of paper or ink, the small self-checkout mini mart was turned into a vending machine (without notifying the residents of this change).\n\nLastly, there are predatory business practices when it comes to renewal. I have known of several other residents who received emails saying they signed a lease when they did not. They would then go in and ask about it and the management team would say they merely are wanting them to sign. It seems like a way to scare people into resigning to me.\n\nOverall, it is a very nice place to live that has been ruined through poor management practices.",

If there is a vehicle parked improperly resident's can request for the vehicle to be towed. This service is available 24 hours a day. As for the fire you mentioned, it was contained that same night and did not affect any buildings. The Fire Department ruled out the possibility of arson on the scene. We too were sorry to see the market go, but this was a decision made by the vendor due to a high amount of items not being paid for. We sent out two notices about the change to residents. We send out offers to residents about renewing each time we have a new special or deadline, so we can keep resident's informed about renewing.

I have lived here the entire year with my car and recently found out my car was towed. How I found out is where the issue lies; my phone number is on call, my license plate and car description is connected with my car (as well as a sticker showing that I am a resident here), but I had to CALL the towing company myself after however many days it's been impounded and find out that I'm being charged $500 to retrieve my car that I have parked in my own apartment complex. Not ONCE was I notified by any of management that my car was being towed nor do I know WHY my car was towed. I have been unable to reach any of management for the urgency of this issue to find recourse for this or to even find out why I wasn't even simply contacted. Lark Bellingham takes a shoot first, ask questions later kind of aggressive approach with all issues that don't concern them, yet when you as a tenant have an issue, I guarantee most of the time you won't actually get more than a \"We're sorry!\" This has occurred in multiple situations. My roommates car was broken into earlier this year while parked on the complex and had an expensive subwoofer in (his car was lock, the window was literally sRuntimemashed.) Something like this would normally be easily solved by having security on site, right? Well, Lark claims they do, but they have gone through at least 6 security officers in the span of this year and none of them have offered any actual protection to a complex as big as this. When he contacted management, all they did was point to the lease and say they're not responsible. Lark will take to their lease agreement and offer no recourse or assistance in any time of need; my neighbors were broken into and it took them weeks to send out an email which just stated \"Just keep your doors locked!\" I would not recommend Lark to anyone.\n\nEDIT 02/01/2020\nYou probably see Lark's response below me, assuring that they'd take care of any issues. Don't be fooled. They basically just reiterated to me that I'm SOL and I never was given any apologies. Management truly is a joke.",

There is 400 parking spots for 700 units, I am told this is within city ordinances,  I tried to buy a reserved spot but there were none available ,but will be looking into that personally. I have never lived in an apartment complex that did not offer each unit at least one parking spot. I keep seeing reviews about insulation, our heating bills have been running $220 a month, seems a bit high to me. The first 3 or 4 months we lived here we got mega phone calls, emails, text trying to get you to sign a new lease,  we kept telling them no, and kept getting calls until I had to get rude with them and was told that I needed to unsubscribe to text, etc.. but then if you got a package they could not notify you because you I opted out.  I got an email from management complaining about a serious offense,  I tried to find out what the offense was, but I was told I had to come in person and talk to them, I am 53 yrs old. I felt like I was being punished by a principal or something, I go in and am told that there was loud screaming like a child screaming late at night and early in the morning ( felt like I was being accused of child abuse. My grand daughter is almost always asleep by the 11 pm  Noise restrictions, and sleeps until 10 or 11 am. Sometimes when she is playing she has a high pitched scream, but I guess we are not allowed to play. although I have an elephant and a hyena that live above me and have parties until all hours of the night especially on weekends,  they must have got in trouble too because the parties have been less frequent.  They have quarterly inspections, or the rental agreement says approximately quarterly, but it has been 65 days and another inspection today.  You start getting rent reminders before the end of the month is up letting you rent is almost due, on the 1st of the month you get a reminder that your rent is due per your rental agreement, they were sending out e-mails that stated you could use the night deposit box to put your rent in. but there is not one. Managements name was on it, but she didn't even know what was in the automatic email that was being sent out. last month my rent was counted by several of us. and on the 4th or 5th of the month I got a notice telling me I needed to come pay them $1.36 (seriously) I am also in fear of retaliation of this post. The girls at the front desk are nice, the security gates don't work properly, sometimes the entrance gates are open all night long, the exit gates you have to sit and wait to get out of the complex in the middle of the day sometimes,  I had to call the police one night as I heard the neighbors boyfriend pounding on the window at 2:30 am followed by the sounds of something like the siding getting ripped off of the wall, I heard my neighbor crying, I went back outside and seen the screen all mangled and her crying inside the window so I called the police. (only for her safety) I don't complain about the noise, as I know I live in College housing. its only expected. I was told if I didn't keep my grand daughter (2 yrs old) from the noises I would be kicked out and still owe the remaining of my lease.  (After 1 warning) This is unfair, they knew there was a child when we moved in. Kids make noise   sometimes, I guess its not OK for the kids to play and have fun during normal hours but is OK for me to have to listen to all night parties,  furniture being moved all over the house,  beds banging against walls, elephants trampling through the upstairs and , and hyenas laughing all night long",

When students complain, they do nothing about it. They fire a lot of people as well.\n- The students are terrible where you will hear party noises all the time because there is no quiet hours. Even when there are fireworks being launched, management doesn't do anything as well as the police.\n- They can take away the recycle center if they wanted to\n- Far away from campus",

When we go into the apartment upon move out, we do identify items of value and importance, and things that are irreplaceable. This would include documents, electronics, clothes, etc. When it comes to trashing out any other items, this would be any trash that was left such as toiletries, dishes, pans, household items, etc. A holdover fee was assessed due to the apartment still being occupied past his agreement end date. Our staff did reach out to Joseph on move out to explain that there was a fee being assessed, and he confirmed he would be getting his items that night. It is simply a holdover fee for not turning in keys on time, we still take possession of the apartment at that time. As he did not come to remove his belongings that night, at that point, we do go in and begin clearing the apartment.  We did bag and tag his items, and then set it aside in our office for him to come pick them up. If you have any further questions about this, please reach out to our office at 360-778-1500 or office@larkbellingham.com"

I got an email to co-sign for him.  I called them in less than 24 hours after he signed and asked that it be cancelled as he did not qualify and I was between jobs at that time and was not in a position to co-sign and I felt like he could do better than the outrageous rent he was paying there.  The person I spoke with said no problem it would be cancelled.  I again asked, so I will not be getting a final fee for this at move out?  Repoh, definitely not mam we will tear it up.  Even though I provided multiple emails and told them about this conversation I had to pay over 500 bucks or they were going to turn him and myself into collections.

I signed a lease here and attempted to cancel it before move-in and was given the runaround from the staff, who seem to have poor communication skills. It was posed that I had to find a subletter instead of cancelling my lease, which is against the law. I was told by one staff member finally that it was fine and that they'd take care of it and it would be fine. They closed out my online portal account and my access to any signed documents, and I didn't hear from them for a month before receiving an email saying I owed them for the whole term of the lease only two months into the year. I have not seen any reasonable measures on their part to re-rent the unit I was assigned in order to mitigate damages (illegal under RCW 59.18.310). Needless to say, they will be hearing from my family's attorney.  Of all the predatory rental companies in Bellingham, they might be among the worst. Avoid at all costs.",
