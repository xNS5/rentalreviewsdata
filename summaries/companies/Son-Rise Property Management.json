For example, some users have highlighted the company's helpful and understanding approach to tenant issues and their readiness to address problems promptly.

Furthermore, courteous and helpful interactions with staff members on the phone and in-person were also noted, contributing to an overall satisfactory renting experience.\n\nProperty management staff, when they do engage, is described as being friendly and easy to work with, and some have reported a smooth renting and move-out process, with full deposits returned except for nominal cleaning fees. A couple of tenants have also praised specific members of the Son-Rise team for their professionalism in handling listings and looking after properties effectively.\n\n## The Bad\nHowever, the majority of user reviews lean unfavorably towards Son-Rise Property Management, depicting a less-than-ideal situation.

Charges for lawn maintenance and cleaning upon move-out were also cited as points of contention, with several tenants feeling that deductions from security deposits were unreasonable.\n\n## The Ugly\nDiving deeper into the negatives, certain reviews paint a concerning picture of the company's property management practices. Accusations of disrespect and condescension towards tenants, particularly younger ones, are a repeating theme, suggesting a tarnished reputation in terms of tenant relations.

Instances of lackluster responses to urgent maintenance requests have aggravated tenant frustrations, culminating in a pervasive sentiment of neglect and mishandling.\n\nThis article, generated by ChatGPT, is only intended to be a tool to help guide you in finding a suitable property management company or rental property, making use of aggregated user reviews to provide a comprehensive overview of Son-Rise Property Management's services.
