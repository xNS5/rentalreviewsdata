A clown named Oliver Moreau was the most obnoxious and unprofessional person I have dealt with in years.  He lied about sending accounting statements and was an arrogant ass sending rude emails to me, a paying Client, then dared me to report him.  I own multiple properties and would NEVER use this agency to manage them.  I strongly recommend you look elsewhere if you are considering renting in the Bellingham market.",

      "review": "I have a relative living here while at school, and called management to ask about a fine $1000 fine for a pet bowl. The lease states no pets or pet guests, They have twisted this into not allowed to own pet items or have pet items in the apartment. This means if you are a dog walker and you have a dog toy, that's grounds for a $1000 fine. No reduction, no warning, no 10 day to comply, no compassion for first time offenders. Not only has Megan the on-site Manager been difficult to work with, but I escalated this to Chuckanut Property headquarters and spoke to Jared. My first interaction with Jared was, I left him a voicemail to discuss the fine. He sends me an email with just pictures. To me this shows the true lack of professionalism and I am appalled by this behavior. Not only are they not willing to work with the us they threatened eviction to ruin their rental history forever. I mean who does that?? I'm going to write a letter to the owners of Pomeroy Group to see if this is going to be standard practice going forward. I normally do not give reviews like this but I know many students are on fixed incomes and $1000 is an extreme fine. Not to mention they asked for a payment plan, they said ok but then charged a late fee. So an extra $80 every month they do not pay in full. Absolutely ridiculous and unethical business practices.",

      "review": "If I could give this place a zero I would.  These people are crooks.  They will change you fees that they did not disclose.  We just recently moved out of our rental.  The landlord was great and thank goodness I knew him.  We sent in our 30 day notice and we were send a checkout sheet and and e-mail telling us that we would be charge a CARPET cleaning fee per lease agreement and an admin fee.  That was it.  Well the landlord decided after we moved out he would replace carpets.  So I got an e-mail to confirm that we would not be charged a carpet cleaning fee since new carpet going in.  When we got our deposit refund they charged us a professional cleaning service. Even thought I cleaned and had a service come in and clean $200 out of my pocket they \"SAID\" they hired a team to clean as well and changed me $265....WTF!!  I went back and forth as to why I wasn't told they would send a service in.  Well it's part of your lease.  No it's not.  You clearly said carpet cleaning and admin fee.  Nothing about cleaning service and why would you send me a check out cleaning check list if you were going to send in a cleaning service.  I asked the neighbors and they said they saw carpet people but no cleaning service ever showed up at house.  I think because they couldn't charge me the carpet fee they decided to \"ADD\" a professional cleaning fee.  These people are crooks, they will take your money do not rent from them.  If you are a home owner DO NOT use them as you are doing a disservice to your renters.",

      "review": "One star is the lowest rating that I could give but this property management company doesn't even deserve that as a rating. They are unresponsive swindlers who took $365 dollars out of our security deposit for \"professional carpet cleaning\" AND \"professional cleaning\" that was not in our original lease. We originally signed a lease through an equally terrible private landlord and midway through our lease he hired Chuckanut Properties to manage it. Prior to moving out, we emailed them to let them know that we were not under their lease requirements and shouldn't be charged us for professional carpet cleaning as it was not in our original lease. They notified us that we wouldn't be charged for that charge. HOWEVER, we received our security deposit back and we were charged $185 for professional carpet cleaning AND $180 for professional cleaning. We sent several emails, went to their office, and called almost everyday for a week to get this fixed but no one would contact us back until 10 days later when they finally responded with a crap excuse on why we were charged. We were basically told \"actually your lease does say you would be charged for professional carpet cleaning as it's apart of cleaning services\" - WHICH WAS STILL NOT IN OUR ORIGINAL LEASE AND WHY WERE CHARGED TWICE?? We were also told that we left rope, linen, and a plunger which is also why we were charged (But those things were there before we even moved in!!!). We are 3 broke college kids who cannot afford a lawyer, but if we could, we would pursue legal action as this is a complete joke. It's a shame how pretty much every property management company in Bellingham is terribly rated, thus making options low to choose from, but at least try a different company as maybe you won't be treated as poorly if you don't rent from CHuckanut Property's.",

      "review": "My daughter was applying with friends on a house that they were told that nobody else was looking at.  So they jumped on it.  I had to co-sign therefore I had to fill out the forms as well, along with a credit check and a $50 charge for each of us.  Come to find out, Chuckanut completely lied to my daughter and there were a lot of people looking at this particular house for rent.  So I got charged $50 for my daughter and $50 for me to run a credit check.  I called 3 times, each time, telling me that the Owner/Manager was unavailable and would get back to me.  NEVER did.  I was very upset, I feel they took advantage of the situation only to get more money.  I have had no response whatsoever from them and did a dispute through my credit card company to get my money back, because Chuckanut is obviously not going to do anything.  And on top of everything else my credit took a hit, my daughter and I will NEVER use this company again.  Talk about \"not doing the right thing\"",

      "review": "Do not rent from these people if you can help it. When we went it to sign the lease, they didn't give us a copy, saying that tenants often lost the lease before the move-in date and that they would give us a copy when we got the keys. On move-in day, they could not find our lease at all. They said they would keep looking, but they never found the lease in the year we rented from them. These idiots lost our lease! That means we didn't have any copy of the rules associated with the apartment, and apparently the lease mentioned that you needed to specifically request  checks be split between the two parties for the security deposit in a specific way. But we didn't have the lease, so we apparently didn't follow their rules. Then when I asked them to split the lease, they told us they couldn't and said we should have known better because it was in the lease--the lease that they never gave ys. They never did split the check, causing a lot of headaches for me and my roommate (who moved out early due to a family emergency). I emailed them complaining about the poor treatment and never got a response. Plus, when I was renting from Chuckanut, they scheduled a showing of the apartment and then the day of, they called me asking if I had an extra key or would be home at the time to let them in because, get this, THEY LOST THE KEY. These people can't keep track of anything and they treat tenants like dirt. This is the laziest, most inconsiderate rental company I have ever encountered.",

However, our experience thus far (since Aug 15, 2018) has been less than stellar. \n\nMy husband moved into the property at lease signing and I joined him a month later when our belongings arrived from CA. I had to do a deep clean on the refrigerator, stop top (which was disgustingly dirty), and the oven and microwave. I also had to patch the holes in the wall from picture hanging and cat scratches and paint over them. When I approached the Property Manager (Jaime), he said he had sent someone over to clean because the owner did not have time to do so when they left. Obviously that cleaning did NOT take place.\n\nI've had problems with the dishwasher, the dryer and the washing machine. Both the dishwasher and the dryer have been repaired after a lengthy wait.\n\nThe washing machine is malfunctioning. I identified this back in October and was told I overloaded it. I've been struggling with it since.\n\nThe light in the bedroom, which is my office, is so dim you can't see anything in the evening!

Olivia works in their office and is generally helpful, understanding and pleasant. Ann is also nice and very thorough, though she has called me 'kiddo' before which can feel a little condescending.  \n\nBe careful when you sign your lease here though. My roommate renewed her lease at our apartment, while I decided to leave. Come time for my lease to end and I am told that by her signing a renewal, I was also obligated to the rent for the following year. I'm still not sure how I can be signed onto a lease without my signature or knowledge. I was pretty frustrated by this, but even more frustrated that no one in the office seemed to be able to get their story straight. Everyone kept telling me different things and when I was trying to explain that to someone in the office she hung up on me without saying anything and had someone else call me back.\n\nThey definitely like to take advantage of perceived naivety in college students and seemed frustrated that I called them out.   \n\nEventually all was resolved, but it took a little fighting to get there. Overall not a bad company but that experience really changed my opinion of them.",

I looked at their ratings today out of curiosity and it's amazing that this company is still apparently getting away with the same scummy and underhanded things they tried on us. If you're considering doing business with these guys, read the negative reviews below and believe every word of them. Those reviewers are telling the truth. \n\nWe rented an apartment from Chuckanut and were very easy on it. No damage, no excessive dirt or problems, but they tried to charge us for anything and everything on our way out to make sure our deposit wouldn't be returned. In fact, for us, they managed to find about $150 more in charges than our deposit covered so we were being asked to pay. \n\nI researched WA state laws regarding what landlords can or cannot charge you for and sent them a letter challenging some of the charges and--lo and behold--they knocked off just enough of the supposedly legitimate charges to come down to exactly equal to our deposit. Gosh, what are the chances? \n\nI have always resented that they made such an obvious attempt to scam us (and this was a long time ago, when we didn't have any money to begin with) so I thought a review, even this long after the fact, was in order. \n\nDo not do business with these people.",

Like others, I will never rent a property managed by this company ever again \n\nMy child has rented an apartment at Pomeroy Court for nearly a year. We recently discovered that all the electricity usage for the on-site office is charged to our electric bill. We were not told this at the time that we rented the apartment, it is not in the lease, we just happened to discover it for ourselves. As I write this, Chuckanut Property Management is tapping into our water and running it into the office for their use. Yes, the water is metered for each apartment and paid for by the tenant. PG&E will do nothing to help you. If you are currently renting in any area of the country, take the steps to verify that you are not paying utilities that do not  belong to you. \n\nWhen confronted with this situation the property manager told us the he meant to talk to us about the shared meter but forgot about it. We were offered a compensation of .45 a day for 20 days a month. We sent the property manager an electric bill generated during a billing period when our child was home visiting us the entire billing period. This bill was 2.5 times the amount of compensation that we were offered by this property manager, that's without including the winter heating costs of the baseboard heater located in the office. As of yet, we have had no response to this compromise offer.\n\nThe parking situation at this site is a joke. Not every apartment has an assigned parking space. We do have an assigned parking space but it is constantly taken by people visiting the office, vendors and repair people working at the complex, people visiting friends at the complex and those poor tenants who have no assigned parking space.\n\nMaintenance? Put in a request nearly a year ago to fix a big hole put in a closet door right at the entry way to the apartment - still there.",

My sister and I moved into an apartment that had not been cleaned or even checked to see if anyone had even moved out and several things were broken and we are STILL doing our dishes in the bathroom because even after calling Chuckanut four times and promising to get it \"taken care of\" they have yet to do anything. I'm beyond frustrated and I love our new apartment but boy this company did nothing to even make sure they cleaned it or checked it before new renters came in. And might I add that we drove seven hours to get here and had to move in all of our things on a weekend into a dirty apartment. Not cool. Chuckanut is the WORST.",

We slaved for weeks ahead of time to clean it up as nicely as possible.  I even pulled out the refrigerator and cleaned out all the shelving.  I have experience doing move outs for apartments and for a $300 dollar job that would be 12 hours of work.  There was never even a couple hours needed for the cleaning when we left it, and I challenge them to prove they spent that much money on cleaning my place.\n\nMy deposit was 900 and the Deposit Deposition they sent me had Cleaning, Carpet Cleaning, Painting and Blinds plus re hanging closet doors.  Prices were 300, 160, 196.50, and 243.50 which conveniently add up to 900.  \n\nDO A WALK THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH A CHECK IN SHEET FOR DAMAGES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE.  THEY WILL PAD YOUR MOVE OUT BILL.",

      "review": "I never in a million years thought this would be possible to say, but Chuckanut is so awful they actually make Landmark Real Estate Management look competent and professional by comparison. \n\nPrior to moving in I explicitly stated to them that I wanted the locks changed on the house, as this is a legal requirement that most places don't follow unless you ask for it. At first they put up a fight and argued, their reasoning being \"Well it's not like anyone is going to break in!\" I seriously didn't even know how to reply to that...\n\nAnd THEN they then LIED to us and said they put in all new locks and keys, when it was very obviously several years old at least. Upon moving in almost nothing had been cleaned. When I asked the office staff if someone could come finish cleaning, they just chuckled and said they'd put in a maintenance request for it, \"but we're really busy!\". Obviously, nothing ever came of it. The refrigerator was leaking black grease onto the floor. There was mold in the bathroom and bedrooms, growing in the wood and in the carpet. There's water damage all over the walls and floors of the bathroom. At night the living room would collect dew from the single-pane windows, we couldn't store any electronics there. The driveway is made out of concrete cracking everywhere and falling apart, totally riddled with potholes. To be fair, when we asked them to put some gravel in the potholes to fill them up, after a few weeks they did so.\n\nEvery single woman that works in the office (with the exception of one single sweetheart) is rude and condescending. They make it seem like they're doing you a huge favor by merely speaking with you. Any sort of maintenance issue or thing that is broken they'll act like it's your fault and your responsibility until you inform them of the laws in place in the WA State Landlord-Tenant Agreement. Then they act like they've never heard of that before, and it must be something you made up on the spot. \n\nThe property managers themselves are even worse, they are such ridiculous cheapskates that they'll put more effort into NOT doing the right/legal thing than it would take to just resolve an issue. We got straight up accused of lying about our heat being broken, as if we just made it up in order to be an annoyance. Then in order to get out of spending money on fixing it, they offered us a small 6\"x6\" space heater to keep us warm instead. After I declined that, then they had to send out 3 different repair guys to fix it (the first two just looked at it and said \"huh, that's weird, it should be working...\" and then left) and THEN tried to charge us the overtime labor fees for this. I pointed out that this is illegal, and they said they would waive the charges for us, \"as a courtesy\". \n\nIf they refuse to fix an issue with your house that is legally required, and you threaten to pursue legal action, they WILL call your bluff. If you don't go through the formal channels to file a complaint then they won't fix anything. If you're renting from them it's because you're a broke college student with no money or spare time and they know it and they WILL prey upon you. \n\nThey will show up in your house unannounced. I've come home from school on more than one occasion and our landlord was just walking around in our house, no prior notice or any reason given why he was there, just \"I was in the area\". He left as soon as I got there without any explanation. My girlfriend was home alone in the shower one time when a man opened the back door of the house with a key and started to walk in, she called out \"Hello?!\" and the guy slammed the door shut and left without saying a word. The office staff had nothing to say about it besides \"Oh we were probably going to do a showing, sorry we must have forgot to tell you\". \n\nMoving out in 2 months, can't wait. I'm so stoked to see how many bullshit, fabricated charges they take out of the security deposit. Finding housing in Bellingham is tough and if you have to rent from one of the major companies you're pretty much screwed no matter who you choose, but Chuckanut really takes the cake, I think they may be the worst of the worst. Don't go corporate, find a private landlord with a good reputation and you're golden.",

      "review": "When I was in college I moved around a lot, and I dealt with a lot of home owners and rental companies. Chuckanut made my life easy and my property manager was sympathetic to my needs and when we put in a work order it was done in a timely manner. When we moved out we got most of our deposit back, and nothing that was taken out was a shock. Their lease is very thorough when it comes to explaining what will and what might come out of your deposit. We lived in a very cute little condo off of Meridian and it was everything we thought it would be. We went and viewed it when the previous tenant was living there and he was very friendly and had only good things to say. The rent was also a very reasonable price. If you pay attention to the lease when they go over it with you, and take care of the place, you will not have a problem with Chuckanut. Only problem tenants do. If you are on a first name basis with your property manager it is not necessarily a good thing, and if you flush chicken bones down the toilet, you can't blame the property management company.",

      "review": "Words cannot express my displeasure in dealing with these people. I would sooner have someone ram a pitchfork through my buttocks than rent from Chuckanut again. \"Unprofessional\" is the key word here. I'm under the assumption that Chuckanut intentionally hires useless, unintelligent oafs to do their work, because a classroom full of 3rd graders would make better property managers than this lot. \n\nFirstly, they took over our property after our landlord quit. I decided to stay one more year after my roommates moved out. Somehow they could not comprehend this, and even after I told them multiple (as in about 5) times that I intended to stay, our landlord STILL put the house back on the market. \n\nIn addition, it was damn near impossible to communicate with them. Our property manager never once made any effort to meet with us. I have never seen him in person - only the secretaries. And they never returned any of my calls. But they don't hesitate to call you the second a payment is late. \n\nNext, they refused to refund the deposits to my outgoing roommates because it wasn't a \"complete\" move-out. They said it was up to us to work it out with the new tenants. Essentially, they took the deposits and gave them to the new people because we didn't all move out together. In the end, I had to ask the incoming people to pay my outgoing roommates $475 each. All because Chuckanut was too lazy to do it themselves. \n\nWell, after sorting out that hullabaloo I signed a new lease with new roommates. The first month, by accident, I sent a second payment to them. The property manager somehow noticed this; I instructed him to NOT process the check and hold it for the next month. \n\nWell, the next month rolls around and he calls us, all confused, saying a payment is missing. But he can't figure out from who. Apparently the people at Chuckanut don't bother to check who has paid what. He ended up sending ME the ledger so I could determine who had paid. I just want you to think about this for a moment. They asked me, a tenant, to look at their official ledger because they didn't know what payment was missing. Essentially, I had to do their job for them, which took me no more than a minute to work out. I am not joking when I say 3rd graders could do a better job than these people. \n\nAnyway, the extra payment I sent was processed anyway, even after I explicitly told them not to do so. My roommates only had to pay half rent because of this. I ended up paying a portion of the missing rent out of my strapped college student pockets to cover for one of my roommates. Thankfully after this event, we haven't had to speak with them again.\n \nI should also mention that our property manager has still never met with us in person. Through all of these issues, he made no effort to see us, and generally had us speak to the secretaries over the phone because he was \"going out\" or something. Needless to say, I am moving out next fall and shall never rent from Chuckanut again. An inebriated chimpanzee could conduct better customer service. \n\nOh, but they fixed the dryer.",

When we got there we were greeted with simply formalities no \"hello, thank you for coming in.\" We felt unwelcome and that we were an inconvenience for them to deal with. And by deal with I mean hand us the keys and copy our ID and send us to look at the house by ourselves. Which mind you was completely run down and the price was too high for what it is.

      "review": "I rented from Chuckanut for one school year. They gave me 2 keys to the room I rented in a house. One of the keys was for a door that was rarely locked. One night, this particular door was locked and the key did not fit in the lock.  I was new to town, and did not know anybody local so I called the emergency number that Chuckanut provided. No one answered and never called me back.  I had no choice but to sleep on the stairwell outside of this locked door. I could have been robbed or harmed since I wasn't shielded from potential intruders.  The next morning, I caught a bus to the rental office. The lady working there said \"try this key\". I had to ASK for transportation back to my apartment. She agreed to drive me. It seemed to me that it didn't matter that I was kept out of my apartment for an entire night, causing me to miss work the next day. My rent wasn't even prorated. And to top it off, they decided to install a sunlight in our kitchen's ceiling WITHOUT INFORMING US. I arrived home one day to find a man sawing into the ceiling while white dust fell onto appliances, dishes, counters, and the floor. It's like, thanks for all the asbestos, I really appreciate it when I have to clean up my kitchen because YOU failed to do your job correctly! AVOID THIS BUSINESS--THEY DON'T RESPECT YOU!!!!!!",
