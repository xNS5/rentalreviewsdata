They lie and blame others for something they screwed up. For example: they would say my roommate was lying to me about parking, rent, etc., to get out of the fact that they acted without reason. Seriously WATCH OUT. Luckily as men, we were able to fix stuff on our own, but I know their maintenance man, Daniel, is useless when helping my friends who were other tenants. They are nice to your face, but it's a SCAM. Other tenants are actually taking them to COURT to get their deposits back.  THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

        "review": "To reiterate what the other reviewer said, these people are crooks!  My daughter rented and apartment for two years and we have been fighting to get the security deposit returned.  We left the place in excellent condition and they made up damages to justify retaining 88% of the $800 deposit.  We took them to small claims court and won.  Now they're trying to stiff us on the amount of the original deposit refund.  Unscrupulous, lying, cheating, low down dirty SOB of an owner!  Don't reward this piece of work by renting one of his apartments!",
