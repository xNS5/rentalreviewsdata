It's not listed as \"student housing\" but is probably better than the options that are actually for students.\n\nI noticed that only some units have dishwashers; mine does not, even though the pictures I was provided showed that there was one, so if you're particular about wanting a dishwasher I would make sure you ask which units have them.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is the laundry situation- we share it with Laurel Court. It's a small room with 3 washers and 3 dryers and they're all old, coin operated, and kind of suck.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place! I've heard people in the past have had issues with PTLA but I never have. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a good fit for students.",

These aspects, although not deal-breakers, can cause inconvenience and merit consideration for potential renters.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>While generally positive, the user reviews do bring to light some significant issues that future tenants might face. The lack of clarity regarding unit amenities, like dishwashers, leads to dissatisfaction and the shared, poorly maintained laundry facilities are seen as a major downside.
