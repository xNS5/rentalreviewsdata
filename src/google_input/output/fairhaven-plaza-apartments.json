Locations do not appear to have full time staff, and I attempted at this property and others in the Bellingham area to get a walk through of various listed studio and one bedroom offerings. On the rare occasion when I got a human to answer the phone, it was always someone who didn't \"handle that particular property\" and \"I'll connect you with her voicemail.\" Left several voicemails, and in two weeks I never received a single callback.",
