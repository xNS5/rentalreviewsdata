She goes above and beyond to make the process as painless and low stress as possible. Always willing to step in and help with anything, and I was not a local owner that could arrange for things necessary in our unit from a distance.\nShe took calls while on vacation and was always ready to answer any questions. Listed and sold within a week with multiple offers while the market was down and rates were up.\nThanks Lauren, for all you do for your clients!",

Our dishwasher had never worked in 5 years, but I didnt want to bother management, didnt want a new one, since I didnt need it. He fixed it in 5 min. He also installed a new heater control for my bathroom. He wouldnt take a tip, and was so nice and professional. Very glad he came. Thank you for having our apts checked every year.",

        "review": "Will take several weeks to respond to emails and/or ignore you altogether. Incompetent communication at best, although I'm beginning to realize possible careless or malicious intentions. Our house has been getting repeatedly vandalized and Utopia has pointed the finger at us, their justification being that it's \"concerning\" that it started happened after we moved in. Keep in mind that I've never had this problem before. Ive put incredible effort into explaining to them why vandalism against a property is the homeowner's responsibility, to which I was told that we are responsible for damage (all damage - really?) and to let them know if I wanted to move out and then silence. I cant remember an instance of a disagreement being handled so immaturely since I was in high school (and that was 10 years ago!). And this has mostly been our experience with them this year, e.g. ignored maintenance requests, ignored emails.\nId expect communication to be a top skill from a company who claims to manage things. Perhaps Id be a lot more sympathetic toward poor communication from folks in a different profession, like a bus driver or a bongo street performer. But this has truly been an outright failure of basic job duties, which was disappointing and low-key embarrassing to witness. Ive had better experiences with even Hammer and Landmark, which are words I never imagined Id be saying. If you intend to stick up for your rights as a tenant, expect the silent treatment. YMMV",

          "text": "Hi Micah,\n\nWe are sorry that you feel this way.\n\nThe first vandalism event occurred over 9 months ago. We had asked you to clean the affected area, as vendors were unavailable at the time. The owners were sympathetic that this had happened and took proper steps with installing motion sensor lights to the exterior of the house. The second event in January did lead to concerns, as the property was previously occupied by the owners for many years. Neither the owners nor the HOA had records of previous vandalism in the area.\n\nYou had originally asked our office where to find in the lease that it states who's responsible for the clean-up of these events. Clear answers have been provided to you. We don't see any requests in our system that have not been addressed. Please reach out if you require assistance.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nShayli\n\n\nRead less"

        "review": "If you are considering renting through Utopia Property Management, I urge you to reconsider. My four months spent as a renter with them were a nightmare from start to finish. Here are a few examples:\n-When we first moved into our house, two of the three toilets were non functional. I submitted maintenance requests, which were marked as completed with no action taken. It took several of us calling the office before someone actually came out to make the necessary repairs.\n-We were threatened with a pay or vacate notice after being double-charged for a month of rent. We called and emailed NUMEROUS times about this before the notice, but received no response until this threat was sent out. We had to physically go into the office and explain their own ledger to them before they removed the charges.\n-Several heating ducts in our home were carpeted over and disconnected, which also led to absurd gas bills, as well as dead rats ending up in the ductwork.\n-It took multiple phone calls after I submitted a maintenance request before someone finally came out to respond to a pest infestation.\n-I have been told over and over again that someone will call me back regarding any number of issues. Not ONCE did I ever receive a phone call or email.\n-Utopia took a check from my housemate, deposited that check, and then did not credit our account with that money.\nThese are just a few examples of the complete incompetence of this property management company. Paying what we paid, for a house in as poor of condition as it was, was already ludicrous. Many rooms lacked heat, holes in the walls everywhere, mold in the bathrooms, and more. But then to be treated the way we were as tenants was absolutely awful. I wish I knew just what I was getting myself into before beginning this mess. If you're looking to just be a source of money and have your landlord have no regard for you as a human being, this place is for you. If you want to do your property managers accounting and bookkeeping for them, Utopia might be a great fit. Otherwise, I suggest you look elsewhere, and save yourself the headache.",

          "text": "We are sorry to hear about your move in experience with Chuckanut management.   Had we managed the process of your leasing to move in experience, these problems would not have occurred. The owner's third-party leasing agent was responsible for finding/vetting roommates, showings, and communication with applicants. Utopia has systems in place to prevent mistakes from happening. This was out of our direct control, but we have worked very hard to resolve each issue brought to our attention. \n\nWe met in person the week of October 27th to resolve the following issues and at the end of the meeting agreed they were resolved to your satisfaction.\nLedger discrepancies investigated during an in-person review from the move in process were identified and corrections made.  The maintenance problems have been resolved through owner directed maintenance.\n\nPlease remember that the owner directs all maintenance repairs of this property personally . We deliver the work order when submitted through the portal to the owner's head of maintenance.  They then take over the entire process: appointment, coordination of vendor, repair, and follow up. This is why work orders are marked as 'completed' or 'cancelled'\n\nWe have given the owner your feedback we received in October and support improvements with their maintenance service.\n\nAmy Krutsinger\nBroker and Property Assistant \nUtopia Management-Bellingham"

        "review": "Utopia is a company that does not care about their tenants in any way. We rented a home with Utopia and had an unfortunate water leak at the property. When Utopia was notified of the leak and the water being turned off to prevent further damage, we where told because it is not an active leak they did not need to respond quickly. Washington RCW's would say differently. They immediately pushed blame to the tenants without any consideration for what actually happened. 8-days later the water was finally restored of which I was told we would have the rent prorated for the time we had to stay elsewhere, yet that never happened. When I tried to engage directly with the property manager I was always pushed off to her assistant. Though the water was restored the damage caused was never addressed. We had to clean the carpets ourselves and reconnect some of the appliances. This behavior continued until the end of our lease in which they withheld parts of our security deposit that where direct results of the water damage.\n\nIf you are a property owner, Utopia will not be a good steward of your investment, If you are a tenant in need, Utopia will only take your rent payment and nothing else. My advise, STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING UTOPIA TOUCHES!\n\nResponse to Jennifer:\nThe wall heaters in this home do not turn off. They are the style that even at the lowest setting still turn on at 47 degrees. So your statement as discussed during the event and in your response below are not accurate. However, you are correct, the property was vacated at the end of August, and I left 2 messages for you that you chose not to return regarding the move-out.\n\nIf I could give you some sound business advice, seek first to understand the whole situation and not just admire the problem with intentions of not being accountable for your lack of action and follow through. This is evident in your response to distract from the nature of my review and make false statements in other areas.",

Thank you for talking the time to speak with me today about this situation.\n\nI am very sorry to hear there wasn't a follow-up by my staff related to the 8 days without the use of the property while the owner completed repairs.  We are sorry that when your son returned, and he had to clean up after the contractor and hook up the dishwasher and washer himself.  In the 7 months since the incident, we have made improvements to our service by hiring a maintenance team of technicians and a coordinator to improve responsiveness to our customers.\n\nBased on our conversation and after some additional research I think we agreed that this was just an unfortunate chain of events - likely a power outage that must have caused the reduced temperatures and the pipe to break.  After more research with the property manager, I found notes that at the time the owner was in disagreement about the fault, but later our PM confirmed he in fact he had changed his mind after visiting the property.  Again, my apologies, but these notes had not made it to the account.   The credit had been missing.  We will process the credit and close out your move out statement with a revision.\n\nFinally, we take feedback seriously and will continue to improve our systems and follow through.  I do hope you will change your opinion of our service in the future and accept our apologies for the mistake and inconvenience.\n\nThank you,\nJennifer Mydland\nUtopia Management"

Hopefully, I was just an anomaly and if you do choose to rent from them, they treat you better.\n\nWe've had some \"frustrating\" issues in our first 3 months (front door locks non-functional, multiple last minute move-in date changes, waking up to the maintenence guy in the attic with no forewarning whatsoever, I could go on..) but all that is not why I'm writing this review..\n\nThe issues began when they blatantly stole my money. The lease specifically states that our utilities will be included in the price of rent, (we have email confirmation and screenshots of this before we moved in). On the move in date we brought our required down payment of first month's rent+handling fees. She said that it wasnt enough, we needed $50 more every month to cover utilities and we cannot move in until we pay it online (which of course had a $10 fee for using card). Having no choice if we wanted a place to live, we payed. Later, we contested this showing them the lease and they admitted that yes, utilities are included in the rent in our lease like we thought. However it's a \"cookie cutter lease\" and that part didn't apply to all their homes, ours being one of them. (Never showed me any of this in writing) We have been charged for utilities every month by them.\n\nExcept for this last month where they automatically pulled our rent, utilities, and then an extra $445 from both me, and my roommates accounts. In other words, instead of pulling the $1500/mo that was originally stated for the duplex, they pulled $2440. Obviously we went and confronted them to which they told us they don't know why it happened but unfortunately it's non-refundable and we'd have to wait until the next month to get it back in credit. In what world is that acceptable? And in case Utopia would like to reply to this review, yes, we have proof of all of this.\n\nDuring that month our duplex has transferred to a different company who thankfully has credited our money and has charged us the proper amount. Looking forward to this new management. Goodbye Dystopia.",

          "text": "Hi Brandon,\nOur properties are not advertised as utilities included.  Each of them has special guidelines set up by the owners.  The utilities were advertised on the website $50 fee for Water/Sewer/Garbage/Yardcare which reported to all the listings.  I am sorry there was confusion with your Welcome letter at the time of move-in.   Since you pointed out the mistake, we have reviewed the documents that were given at your move-in and made these corrections.  An old welcome letter had been used by a new associate on our team which resulted in the misinformation.  At the time of signing the lease had you brought the discrepancy to our attention we would have addressed it immediately.  With the autopay there were 2 autopayments set up by each of you causing additional money to be paid on your account.  We reset your portal which fixed this problem and stopped it from happening.  We do not have control over these payments because of security protocols we are not able to change or edit someone's account.   Your housemate seemed happy with the resolution when we followed up with them.  Thank you - Bellingham Branch\n\nJennifer Mydland, CAPS\nBellingham Sr.  Branch Manager"

We applied for several rentals with multiple property management companies.  There was a big disconnect with several of these companies as their practices make securing a rental quite difficult, especially from afar. Practices like only allowing parties to apply for one property at a time kept us from being considered for multiple units, thereby drastically reducing the likelyhood of finding a rental in a timely manner.  So I made couple trips to Bellingham in the months before our move date , also to no avail.  Luckily we had the good fortune to come across a property management company whose agent listened to our needs and then gladly helped us locate a great home locally.   In just a couple days, after a thorough virtual tour shot on the fly by our agent (thanks Amy!) we were accepted as tenants and finally free to focus on the logistics of the long distance move.

Utopia completed a fair and complete accounting of your deposit, paying very close attention to the move in inspection and lease documents at the time of the physical inspection.  Utopia attached images of all damages and items that were left behind to show the reason for each charge.  This was included with the mailed itemization.\n\nI am sorry to hear that you felt unsafe in the neighborhood and had experienced a rodent problem.  We were not aware that you were experiencing any problems with criminal activity or rodents.  We must be informed immediately when there is a problem at the property so that we can help find a solution.  I am sorry we were not able to do that for you.

          "text": "Hello Ms. Moss,\n\nIt was brought to my attention that you are unhappy with how long it took to repair/replace your dryer recently.  We received your request at the end of January and scheduled an appliance vendor for repair. Unfortunately, this vendor was behind schedule.  With pleading the vendor was able to move up the schedule and come within a week.  They assessed that your washer/dryer needed to be replaced. \n\nAt the same time, we had a change of coordinators. Your work order was one of the first jobs she tackled.  She made sure the new appliance order had been placed, which it had, and kept following up on the status.  This can take 2-3 weeks in general for specialty orders of this type.  Oly had our in-house technician follow up when we heard the laundry closet door might not close due to the size of the appliance.  I understand the maintenance is working on a solution for the door to be hung or adjusted differently.  If that does not work then we will look at a different size appliance.\n\nThe MC will be reaching to get in contact with you.  We understand that it is frustrating to be without an appliance, and we are sorry if you felt like we had not handled that in a timely manner. In the end, we did our very best to deliver good service, but we are at the mercy of vendor schedules sometimes. We understand the review is about the entire service and hope you will reevaluate your assessment once we rectify the door problem.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Mydland"

          "text": "Reposted from April 2021 when you first left a review.\n\nDear Ms. Morris,\n\nWe apologize that you feel there has been a bad experience.  Utopia took over the management on 12/20/20.  The 2020 reports that should have come from the previous company, were not sent out. Frustration related to the lack of their reporting from the past company is out of our control.  I acquired the reports not sent forwarded all of them to you via email\n\nUtopia is not responsible for the prior repairs that were made by the previous company.  Due to your concerns, you asked us to coordinate with your sister.  We had approval to fix a rodent issue, pay a gutter bill, and fix the refrigerator only.  I inspected the property with your sister 2X and there was an obvious water intrusion issue that I was not allowed to manage.  During the second visit we talked about the progress of the rodent treatment, needing approval to close up the holes/cracks where mice/rat gained entry, including the tenant payment issue.   Because they are behind in the rent, they are not eligible for a renewal.\n\nThe rodent treatment was taken care of as swiftly as possible once the approval was made.  The refrigerator was repaired by our service technician, after not receiving any communication from your personal vendor.  Rodent infestation, appliance breakdowns, and water intrusion must be handled swiftly for the safety of the tenant.  On the last inspection, a foundation specialist recommended the installation of a drain in the driveway to move water away from the corner of the house where the foundation leaked into the master bath/closet area.  Utopia has provided the bid for the drain.  No approval received.  Because we are not permitted by the owner to move forward with the appropriate repairs for the health and safety of the tenant, Utopia had no alternative but to end the management relationship.\n\nRegards,\n\nBellingham Branch\n\nJennifer Mydland, CAPS"

        "review": "Will take several weeks to respond to emails and/or ignore you altogether. Incompetent communication at best, although I'm beginning to realize possible careless or malicious intentions. Our house has been getting repeatedly vandalized and Utopia has pointed the finger at us, their justification being that it's \"concerning\" that it started happened after we moved in. Keep in mind that I've never had this problem before. I've put incredible effort into explaining to them why vandalism against a property is the homeowner's responsibility, to which I was told that we are responsible for \"damage\" (all damage - really?) and to let them know if I wanted to move out and then silence. I can't remember an instance of a disagreement being handled so immaturely since I was in high school (and that was 10 years ago!). And this has mostly been our experience with them this year, e.g. ignored maintenance requests, ignored emails.\nI'd expect communication to be a top skill from a company who claims to \"manage\" things. Perhaps I'd be a lot more sympathetic toward poor communication from folks in a different profession, like a bus driver or a bongo street performer. But this has truly been an outright failure of basic job duties, which was disappointing and low-key embarrassing to witness. I've had better experiences with even Hammer and Landmark, which are words I never imagined I'd be saying. If you intend to stick up for your rights as a tenant, expect the silent treatment. YMMV",

          "text": "Hi Micah, \n\nWe are sorry that you feel this way. \n\nThe first vandalism event occurred over 9 months ago. We had asked you to clean the affected area, as vendors were unavailable at the time. The owners were sympathetic that this had happened and took proper steps with installing motion sensor lights to the exterior of the house. The second event in January did lead to concerns, as the property was previously occupied by the owners for many years. Neither the owners nor the HOA had records of previous vandalism in the area. \n\nYou had originally asked our office where to find in the lease that it states who's responsible for the clean-up of these events. Clear answers have been provided to you. We don't see any requests in our system that have not been addressed. Please reach out if you require assistance. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nShayli"

From my initial inquiry to my move-in day, their team has been incredibly efficient and courteous. Maintenance requests are handled promptly, and they take proactive measures to keep the property in top condition. Their online portal is a lifesaver, making it easy to pay rent and communicate with them. Beyond their efficient management, what truly stands out is their dedication to creating a sense of community among tenants. They organize events and initiatives that genuinely bring residents together and foster a welcoming environment. Renting with Utopia Property Management has been an absolute delight, and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking an exceptional rental journey.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In this article, we explore the positive aspects of Utopia Property Management as reflected by user reviews. Tenants commend the promptness and professionalism of the maintenance staff, citing instances where issues like appliance repairs and heating problems were addressed swiftly and effectively. The company's commitment to tenant satisfaction is also highlighted through their efficient online portal for rent payments and communication. Additionally, Utopia's proactive measures to maintain and enhance property conditions are appreciated, making the rental experience seamless for many tenants.</p><p>Further praise is directed at Utopia's efforts to foster a community spirit within their properties. Through organizing various tenant events and initiatives, they build meaningful connections among residents, creating a friendly and welcoming living environment. This dedication to cultivating a positive living experience extends to their administrative tasks, as they exhibit thoroughness in contract administration and lease enforcement, contributing to harmonious landlord-tenant relationships.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Several user reviews for Utopia Property Management highlight outstanding experiences with the company's personnel. Specific mentions include the helpfulness of an agent during the application and move-in process, and instances where property managers went above and beyond in providing strategic advice on estate investments. The dedication of the team in Bellingham, WA is recognized, with their actions having a significant positive impact on clients' rental and management experiences. Their reliability in handling complex administrative tasks and transparency in operations are key factors contributing to this sentiment.</p><p>The company has shown a commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency, addressing eco-friendly practices and providing guidance on environmental impact reduction for tenants. This reinforces Utopia's position as a progressive management company that values both the well-being of its residents and the preservation of the environment. Moreover, the applaudable response times to maintenance issues and professional executions of repairs speak volumes about their effectiveness as a property management firm.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite many positive endorsements, Utopia Property Management has also faced criticism from some tenants. One of the common complaints pertains to the company's responsiveness to emails and maintenance requests. Some tenants have experienced prolonged delays in communication, resulting in unresolved issues or missed repair opportunities. This appears to affect a fraction of users, contrasting otherwise favorable reviews but drawing attention to areas that require improvement.</p><account_ref code=\"k69XeA\"/></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The more concerning feedback pertains to instances where tenants felt Utopia has failed to address serious issues appropriately. Some tenants have reported experiencing vandalism and subsequent blame from the company, with disputes over who is responsible for resolving and paying for these acts. One outlier event led to a situation where communication failed entirely, leading tenants to feel ignored and without support in a crisis. Furthermore, there have been reports of Utopia not abiding by agreements stated within leases, such as including utilities in the rental price. This has unfortunately led to distress and financial inconvenience for affected tenants. While such reviews are in the minority, they do reveal that some individuals have had deeply negative experiences with the property management company.</p></section>"
