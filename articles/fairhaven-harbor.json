        "review": "I have lived at Fairhaven Harbor Apartments for nearly 18 months. I have owned free standing homes for many years. I can honestly say that if any of the apartments I lived in prior to owning were as wonderful as Fairhaven Harbor, I would never have purchased a house. The owner and management team are professional, very efficient, super customer centered, and just plain nice. This place has it all, including a perfect central location which is very walkable. The apartments are modern, attractive, roomy, comfortable and quiet. The common areas are spotless and the entire building is very well maintained. The views from the tastefully furnished rooftop deck are breathtaking, especially at sunset. I love that parking is assigned with much of it under the building. There are lots of other well thought out extras included in the rent. I have looked at most of the other rental options in this area. Fairhaven Harbor Apartments is by far the best in my opinion. This is home.",

Great location for walking around, going to the coffee shop, grocery store within walking distance. We love Fairhaven. Lots of delicious restaurants very close by. Manager Jackie is very accommodating and kind, she answered all of our questions. No complaints at all.",

        "review": "Hi Rita,\nThis is Jackie, the Property Manager for Fairhaven Harbor Apartments.\nI'm sorry you didn't feel good about the phone conversation we had the other day.\nPlease know my first priorities are to the tenants, the tenants that are moving in and the people who have applied and are moving in between now and May 1st.\nI am very busy as I mentioned to you. The apartments are going fast!\nThat is why I told you it would not be a good use of our time to show you apartments that would not be available in June or July\nGood luck in your search!",

        "review": "The apartments are okay. Great location, but the construction just isn't there. I was in a unit above the gym for about a year and was woken up after 11 PM and at 5:30 AM due to the sounds of the treadmill below me. It was completely nerve wracking to get some sleep or try to cook dinner and be disturbed by someone working out. Thankfully Dawnah and team were awesome and allowed me to move to a different apartment high up in the building.\n\nA couple weeks after moving in to the new unit I got a note underneath my door from my new downstairs neighbor asking me to keep it down / walk lighter. I haven't been doing anything crazy in my apartment. I walk around, cook, play with my dog, and when I do workouts I skip the jumping etc. I understand though. The gym was my biggest distraction in the other apartment but I could still hear my upstairs neighbor flushing his toilet or chopping vegetables. Truly frustrating.\n\nThe reason I moved into this complex was I thought it would be well built and quiet after having a terrific experience at a new build in Seattle from 2016 - 2018. Neither have proven to be the case.",

        "review": "I have been helping a friend start the apartment search in Bellingham since her lease is up at the end of August and she would be willing to sign a lease for June or July because she understands the market. We actually both work in property management with student housing, so we do understand the process. She has been living in downtown Bellingham for almost two years and is wanting a change, so I have been searching around Fairhaven for her. I came across Fairhaven Harbor Apartments and gave them a call since they did not have prices listed. I spoke to a women named Jackie and at first she was very helpful and knowledge about her property, but as soon as I asked if she had any showings available she seemed very busy in her schedule since she is currently pre-leasing. She gave me prices of two one-bedroom apartments that are available and what is included. I then proceeded to set up a time for a showing. I also wanted to let her know that my friend's current lease is up at the end of August, but is starting the hunt for a new place because she understands how hard Bellingham can be at times. By stating that I also said that she is willing to sign in June or July. I understand completely if two units are available now that they would not hold a spot at all especially since I work in Student Housing. As soon as I started to wrap up our conversation and said our date and time for a showing would work for us, the women Jackie said \"that would be a waste of our time.\" I immediately said thank you and appreciated her time. But as soon as I got off the phone I started to laugh because the lack of customer services was beyond disbelief. I hate to have this taint my impression of this property, but it has and unfortunately we will not be calling in the summer to see their availability.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In the context of Fairhaven Harbor, tenants have expressed genuine satisfaction with the overall quality of the apartments, highlighting their modern, attractive, and roomy design. The location is frequently cited as \"perfect\" due to its walkability and accessibility to local amenities like coffee shops, grocery stores, and delicious restaurants. Furthermore, the efficiency and professionalism of the property management team have not gone unnoticed, with particular commendation towards how they address tenants' needs and maintain the cleanliness of common areas.</p><p>Some residents have had such a positive experience that they rate Fairhaven Harbor as superior to other housing options in the area, even favorably comparing their current living situation to that of previously owned free-standing homes. The addition of well-thought-out extras included in the rent contributes to a feeling of value and convenience for the tenants. The rooftop deck, in particular, has been a highlight, offering breathtaking views that add to the sense of living in a special place.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Management's responsiveness is a stand-out feature, with user reviews applauding the ease of working with them. The property manager's willingness to accommodate tenants, as shown by allowing a resident to move to a quieter unit due to noise issues, is exemplary of their commitment to resident satisfaction. It is these acts of understanding and flexibility that often convert satisfied tenants into long-term residents who are happy to recommend Fairhaven Harbor to others.</p><p>Praise has been directed towards the amenities offered at Fairhaven Harbor, ranging from assigned parking to high-quality finishings within the units. Resident reviews suggest that such amenities not only meet but exceed expectations, providing a luxurious and comfortable living environment. The management's reaction to feedback, as seen through their engagement with residents\u2019 reviews, is proactive and indicative of a desire to maintain a high standard of living for their tenants.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Although predominately positive, there have been some criticisms, particularly concerning the building's soundproofing. One resident experienced disturbances due to noise from the gym located below their apartment. Such instances highlight potential oversights in construction that can detract from the comfort and quiet enjoyment of tenants. Additionally, a prospective tenant experienced dissatisfaction with the customer service provided, feeling that their interest in scheduling a viewing was dismissed, which left a negative impression that deterred them from pursuing a lease.</p><p>The sound transmission between units appears to be a recurring concern, with another tenant receiving complaints from a neighbor about noise. This has contributed to a sense of frustration for those affected, as they feel their actions within their own living space are restricted due to the perceived lack of adequate sound insulation. These experiences point to a need for potential improvements in the soundproofing measures of the building to ensure that residents can relax without unintentional disturbance to or from their neighbors.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Despite the high average rating and many glowing reports, the impression that poor soundproofing leaves on residents cannot be ignored. It tarnishes the property's reputation for tranquility and privacy, which are crucial components of a luxury apartment experience. Additionally, the response from management to potential tenants inquiring about future availability seems to fall short in some cases, with at least one report of an interaction that was perceived as dismissively unprofessional. This might hint at a sporadic lapse in the execution of customer service standards, which could be detrimental to the establishment's overall image if such incidents are not addressed promptly.</p></section>"
