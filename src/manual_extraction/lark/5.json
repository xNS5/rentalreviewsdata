Way too overpriced, terrible customer service, the office is run by college students who have no idea how to help or what direction to point you in if you do need help, everything is broken constantly, parking is a nightmare unless there's a global pandemic happening so students are staying home, and no noise complaints are enforced (they told me it was my problem to tell them to be quiet). Not to mention the carpenter ant infestation we complained about and were told that it was probably due to our living conditions insinuating we were unsanitary. The garbage and recycling are constantly overflowing and there is broke glass everywhere, even the parking lot in the back corner of the complex where my building is located. There's a serious mold problem in both units I've lived in. When you move out of a unit they charge you ridiculous rates for cleaning services and maintenance only for the unit you move into to be disgusting and in disrepair. The units have paint all over the floors and when we moved in there was a giant white spot on the teal wall from them patching a hole and not bothering to repaint. The previous tenants broke the couch but it wasn't replaced so we will probably be charged for it when we move out despite us not being the ones to break it. I think I would have preferred to live in someone's basement. At least it would have been quieter.",

									"full": "PLEASE READ!!!!!!\nThis place deserves 0 stars. I have lived here for only a few months and it is already terrible. I woke up one morning to find that my car been improperly towed, no notification from lark at all but they okayed the tow. I was told I didn't have a sticker but I had it placed where I was told to put it and their excuse was that \"it was dark and we didn't see it\" have you ever heard of a flashlight?! Lark makes residents pay and extra $30 for a reserved spot yet they can't seem to enforce parking AT ALL! They will lie to you and say their doing their best but it's all a lie. I was told that after hours there is nothing they can do! Residents are the one that need to call the towing company and report improperly parked cars! So my question is why are we having to pay an extra $30 each month if you can't even enforce the parking rules 24/7?! Lark also states that this is a gated community which in some cases it is but in reality they leave the gate open from 7am to 7pm for anyone and everyone to come in and if it's after 7 people that don't live there park outside the gate and wait for someone else to scan their card and sneak in. The management is corrupt saying that they care for their residents yet they suck them dry of their money. Because of larks mistakes I missed work as well as my dad because he had to get my car that they improperly towed having to drive all the way from downtown Seattle to Bellingham and all they offered was to take $30 off my next rent... is that a joke? That was slap in the face to me and clearly showed that all this place cares about is talking as much money as they can from students. It's so sad. Please do not sign a lease here, lark does not deserve the time of day or your money find a place that actually cares for its residents and not just suck them dry. Lark was also formerly known as NXNW and many residents believe the name changed happened because a naked man was masterbating outside in the apartment complex and the police had to shoot him with salt bullets, lark makes it seem like they are a perfect student houseing center but in reality it's party central drugs party's and alcohol 24/7 with no ways to file a complaint. Management is as fake as they come! If you want to have a happy year I would think again before signing here \n\nHere is proof https://youtu.be/iUKMG6ZtTeY",

If she doesn't they are threatening to send her and me to collections. I'm still not sure how I am on the hook never having signed anything.\nIf this group is supposed to be providing housing for students, they should not be using predatory practices to get students who are still in high school to sign leases, and then using punitive charges to make money off of them. \nKeep your child away if possible.

The amenities are a joke. It is far from campus and kids really feel burdened to get to class. The location is so depressing: stuck between the ass end of a Fred Myer and the highway. Our daughter and her roommates can't wait to get out and boy oh boy is she bummed that she agreed that she'd be responsible for paying rent over the summer.

									"full": "Please for the love of god don't rent here. Don't mistake my one star for actually having any appreciation for this place; everything about this place is terrible and while half the stuff they advertise is complete lies, the other half is majorly exaggerated. \n\n- free parking? Nope! Their website implies that parking is free for everyone and that spots are always available, 90% of the time all parking is entirely full except for spots you pay $40 A MONTH FOR. Not only is it $40 extra to have access to an amenity they promised was free, but I have been on the waiting list for a reserved pass for almost 3 months. So, yeah, I'd even pay for parking if i could. Also, don't try temporarily using a reserved spot just until a resident spot opens; your car will get towed at 1 am 30 minutes after parking there! \n- private shuttle bus to WWU? Yeah, if you can manage to get a spot! Students are stuffed on the bus like sardines, some sitting on the floor just to pray they can make it to class on time. For a complex with hundreds of students, you think the shuttle would be able to fit more than maybe 25 people. Also, the shuttle is frequently shut down with no more than 12 hours notice for \"maintenance\"; once it was gone for three days while they gave it an ugly new decal. \n- $200 pet fee per year? Yeah, but there are rules they don't advertise: you can't have more than 2 pets, it's $200 per pet, and they'll make it as hard as possible to get any information. I was trying to emergency foster a small litter of kittens and the office was rude and condescending to me, as well as completely unwilling to help. \n\nThe walls to other apartments are thin. Noise complaints aren't verified and you'll be held responsible even if you and your roommate were ASLEEP when the complaint was filed. The desk attendants are friendly but absolutely clueless and all give different information. When I filed a complaint about parking, the response i got was rude and suggested that I uber to work so I don't have to worry about their incompetent amount of parking (ubering to my job would cost around $30-$40 every night, which is almost as much as I make in one shift). When I filed a maintenance request about my dishwasher that wasn't cleaning dishes, I was told that I was \"putting the dishes in wrong\" and that bowls and pots weren't supposed to go on the bottom rack of the dishwasher even though that's exactly how a dishwasher works. Maintenance was either clueless or too lazy to fix it. Maintenance will enter your apartment with no regard for you or your privacy completely unannounced. Amenities will be taken away with 0 notification to the students; one of the biggest things that drew me to this place was the tanning beds they advertised. I suffer from seasonal depression and I was thrilled when I learned they offered tanning beds, only to be replaced with a \"meditation room\" with no notification to the residents. Security once yelled at us for playing music with our windows open at 9:30 pm on a Friday. Rooms are much smaller than they show them off to be. Wifi that's provided is slow and unreliable. All communication with the complex is condescending and rude. Drywall is cracked and waterlogged because of faulty appliances. Lights frequently flicker for no reason. \n\nOn top of all of this, our rent is $1700 a month. Lark Bellingham is taking advantage of and scamming students. I loved this place at first but everything advertised is gold plated. Take your money somewhere else.",

Be aware that this company is very aggressive about collecting any move out fees and will send you threatening letter indicating that they will report you to National Credit Services if you do not pay this fee within 2 weeks.   Take this threat seriously and pay your fees or they will attempt to ruin you credit.  We paid the fees within a month of move out and they did report us to a credit agency the month after payment. It has been a hassle getting our credit fixed.  We were able to prove payment prior to the company sending us to collections and I think this is straight now.  Probably best to avoid this company from the start.",

When we go into the apartment upon move out, we do identify items of value and importance, and things that are irreplaceable. This would include documents, electronics, clothes, etc. When it comes to trashing out any other items, this would be any trash that was left such as toiletries, dishes, pans, household items, etc. A holdover fee was assessed due to the apartment still being occupied past his agreement end date. Our staff did reach out to Joseph on move out to explain that there was a fee being assessed, and he confirmed he would be getting his items that night. It is simply a holdover fee for not turning in keys on time, we still take possession of the apartment at that time. As he did not come to remove his belongings that night, at that point, we do go in and begin clearing the apartment. We did bag and tag his items, and then set it aside in our office for him to come pick them up. If you have any further questions about this, please reach out to our office at 360-778-1500 or office@larkbellingham.com",
