        "review": "Wish I could give zero stars. Never had an issue with a property management company before this one (call me lucky I suppose). However, this company finds sneaky ways to charge you fees (not small ones), and their customer service team will deflect and ignore any concerns you have regarding the clarity or legitimacy of said fees. Reaching out to the owner, Rachel, was also not helpful as she never answered any emails and the rest of her team would not ever put me in touch with her. Above all, Access's customer service was the worst I've ever dealt with. Customer service is hard work but they were consistently beyond rude any time we called, acting like it was a massive inconvenience to deal with anything.",

        "review": "Access has good people that seem to mean well but some are incompetent at their job. If you decide to move forward with them, expect poor service on weekends, independently check on your property after the tenant moves out, and most importantly, check their math! \n\nDuring my experience, I had rude customer service when I called on a Saturday, my property smelled of wet dog after the tenant moved out, and I was overcharged on multiple occasions. Access was quick to correct their accounting mistakes when I pointed them out so I would highly encourage anyone who uses their services to double check their invoices and challenge them as necessary - I was overcharged multiple times during my ~6 months with access.\n\nThe aforementioned inconveniences make the overall experience unpleasant. To the access team, I recommend double checking invoices before sending them out and maintaining an open line of communication with owners.",

        "review": "ATTENTION BELLINGHAM STUDENTS,\nACCESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE COMCAST OF RENTAL AGENCIES\n\nThis is the first business that has ever been so thoroughly unethical, that I felt compelled to warn the public about them.\n\nThese people are scam artists through and through; preying on the young and financially challenged. Their business seems to generate a significant portion of its income from fines, fees and extravagant move out charges. \n\nThey are very good at making it abundantly clear that their only goal is to generate profit and any expense. \n\nAdditionally, it seems that their business is very disorganized. They can not seem to keep track of any maintenance requests or documentation. After several written requests for repairs to features that were damaged upon move-in, we eventually gave up and just accepted that we were going to have to live with the pre-existing damage. Little did we know they would attempt to hold us financially responsible for said damage upon move-out.  \n\nThese people are not to be trusted and will take any action necessary to exert their power over the young and under privileged. If you attempt to dispute any of their actions or charges they will NOT hesitate to block youfrom contacting them, or even go as far as to take preemptive legal action against you.\n\n\nYou have been warned.",

        "review": "If you enjoy renting from a company that actively steals from you, tries to upcharge without checking info, and doesn't care about their tenants than access is right for you! While renting from them for one year we experienced water coming up from the floor boards and were told this was a normal and ongoing issue and they would \"look into it\", they did not. We experienced plumbing issues, including waste leaking in from the upstairs unit, and Access was unhelpful and unconcerned. After an attempted break in we had to threaten them, as they kept hanging up, in order to have basic security measures enforced such as nailing the windows so no one could sneak in again. Additionally we were repeatedly \"charged\" for utilities and bills that were not in our name but in the last tenants information. This billing issue took over three months to fix and because of their speedy turnover in personnel we never talked to the same person twice. This company will take full advantage of anyone and especially college renters who may not be familiar with renters rights, an issue I now know by heart. I would give them negative stars if I could. Please avoid this godawful agency at all costs. I wish I had seen a review like this before I had signed a lease.",

        "review": "I would give this company zero stars if that were an option.  When inquiring about a rental property I wished to view (requested a tour via Zillow), I was informed there was one applicant ahead of me and that I needed to submit an application if I was interested in the property.  I did as I was instructed, including paying the $65 application fee, and then waited to hear back from them as to when I could view the property.  I inspected the property from the street and called the number listed on the signage in front of the property only to be informed that it was a non-working number in Canada.  After 5 days of waiting to see if I heard anything regarding a tour, I called Access Real Estate Services directly, and requested another tour of the property.  Only then was I informed that I had not needed to submit the application and fee if all I wanted to do was to view the property.  Also, they would not refund my application fee (as I had already suspected).  I'm just thankful that I found a property that does not utilized this particular company.  A slightly expensive lesson to learn, but lesson learned indeed!!",

Our website clearly states that application fees are nonrefundable (standard practice in our industry).  However, we do allow people to use their existing application for 60 days for another one of our properties.  As far as the unlisted Canada number goes, you must have dialed the wrong number.  All of our signs have the same phone number and we double checked to make sure no one altered our sign.   Regards, David"

Every other property management company in the area I've spoken to has reached out to their property owners and we've come to an agreement but the availability dates of their homes just haven't lined up.\n\nThis company stands alone in both not helping future tenants and not trying their best to get their client's homes rented. Three months of lost business, let's keep that number going!\n\nEdit: Just noticed they are one of the LOWEST rated companies in the area.

Office manage Brian is not helpful in anyway and the team he runs is lacking knowledge on how to do their job. On move out I was giving no paper work for updated address and when I called to ask where and when I would be receiving my deposit and invoice they said they sent it to the last know address, that was where I just moved from.

Our washer broke, and the installer out the new one in incorrectly and flooded the house.\n\nThe owner of the company, Rachel, was disgusting to deal with. She was rude, standoffish, condescending, and truly horrible to work with.\n\nI'm a business owner, I understand how vendors and schedules work, there was no reason for her to lie to me the way her and her staff did over and over again about returning our apartment to a liveable condition in a timely manner.\n\nThey also lied to us about our lease renewal. They told us they were renewing our lease, and that it was in the mail. Weeks went by, so I called and checked up, I was reassured it was in the mail. Shortly before the lease was up, they told us last minute that they weren't.\n\nI know renting in Bellingham is hard, but Rachel and Access are parasites and should be avoided at all costs.",

However, in my honest experience as a tenant at 2-3 other local companies here in Bellingham, I have come to realize that Access is absolutely the preferred property manager in town. There is a level of competency and attentiveness that you will only find at a smaller company such as this. Additionally, these qualities are matched only by their willingness to be fair (within the dictates of landlord-tenant law). Simply put, there IS a reason why Access has the highest google rating in town. Any unhappy tenants that say otherwise simply do not understand how legally binding contracts operate, or how one upholds their end of a lease agreement.",

In fact, the information I found on cosigners said that they are needed by \"Anyone without income equal to at least 3 times the monthly rent,\" with no mention of needing to be a full time student.\n\nMy room mates and I are employed and fully capable of paying rent. We all have cosigners available in order to meet the requirements for the listing, as specified on the website. The fact that we are not allowed to utilize them is frankly baffling to me.

Leases are legal contracts and tenants cannot be let out of leases just because they want out.  That would be a disservice to the property owners we represent.  Our company has done nothing improper at all.  We followed the law by responding to all issues that were reported without exception.

When a maintenance issue came up - they were told to give me a quote - that I'd like the \"worst case senario\" cost wise.  When I got the bill (no communication at all to indicate I could expect to be hosed), it was for three times the \"high side\" quote - and additionally, the person they contracted with did not do the work he had indicated he would - only part of the work.  If you want to get screwed over and have them expect you to thank them for it - go ahead and hire them.  I found them to be unprofessional and extremely arrogant.",

          "text": "Doug, I'm sorry you feel the way you do.  What you don't realize here is that we, as property managers, do not get to make all of the decisions.  The owners of complexes often insist on rent increases after they have made investments in the property, which is the case with your particular apartment complex.  Honestly, the rents were too low at this complex compared to others nearby.  It's also important to realize that owners of complexes can legally deny certain categories of individuals tenancy, which was done in your case.  I also add that neither you nor anyone else has been denied tenancy because you are disabled.\n\nI am 100% certain there was no executed lease document between our company and you.  You were offered tenancy and then we realized you fell into a category the owner of the complex no longer wished to rent to.  We verified with the proper authority that denying tenancy in this manner was indeed legal.  I made that phone call myself.  So, the offer of continued tenancy was withdrawn as soon as we realized what had happened.  You were given more notice than your existing lease requires that we would not be renewing your lease.  There is nothing illegal or nefarious here.\nI wish you the best in your search for your new home.  David M Long Jr"

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Many user reviews highlight positive experiences with Access Real Estate Services, especially those who have engaged with certain staff members. Renters and property owners alike appreciate the professional and responsive nature of the management when it comes to maintaining properties. A frequent point of praise is how promptly the team addresses maintenance requests and any concerns raised, with some tenants noting repairs have been completed quickly and efficiently. Several reviewers specifically mention the professionalism and understanding nature of the staff, indicating a focus on ensuring satisfied and comfortable tenants and property owners alike.</p><p>There are comments about the accessibility and friendliness of the owners and employees, making the leasing and management process rather seamless for customers. The services provided by Access Real Estate Services reportedly relieve the stress associated with property management, as they handle issues competently and keep clients informed. This support is emphasized by property owners who are not local, who find reassurance knowing their investments are well-managed. The high level of service is a common thread among satisfied clients, promoting the company's reliability.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Access Real Estate Services has earned strong commendations from clients who have enjoyed positive rental and management experiences with the company over multiple years. Some user reviews detail exceptional service, particularly noting the attentive and reliable communication of staff members like Bryan and Rachel. Several reviews highlight a seamless transition into their properties, with some even being first-time homeowners attributing smooth experiences to the company. Such commendations often focus on how Access Real Estate Services provides above-and-beyond customer service, making tenants and landlords feel valued and important.</p><p>Moreover, clients praise Access for being proactive and thorough, with many complimenting the detailed financial reports and meticulous accounting, which ensure transparency and help maintain trust. The appreciative sentiment is often echoed by those involved in homeowners associations and condominium board members, who found Access to be excellent partners in navigating complex property issues calmly and professionally. Their ability to manage both residential rentals and homeowner association intricacies successfully places them in high regard among certain clientele.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Conversely, a number of reviews indicate discrepancies between anticipated and actual service quality, illustrating dissatisfaction with Access Real Estate Services. Several users report receiving incorrect information about financial obligations or finding additional fees that were not clearly communicated. In some cases, the application's processing method frustrated clients, particularly when they were required to pay for applications without clear information on property availability, leaving a bitter impression regarding transparency and customer interaction.</p><p>Some tenants express dissatisfaction due to perceived unprofessional behavior from staff, particularly in interactions concerning property showings and communication about lease agreements. A recurring theme is the apparent disorganization noted by potential renters who experienced canceled viewings or property discrepancies upon visiting. Tenants also cite examples of being treated with dismissiveness when addressing concerns, which paints a picture of inadequacy in client relations from their perspective. These issues contribute to an overall view of inconsistent service, leading to frustration among the affected renters.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most severe grievances with Access Real Estate Services stem from allegations of unethical practices and neglectful management. Multiple user reviews accuse the company of imposing unnecessary charges, such as move-out fees or repair costs for damages that existed prior to tenancy. Some tenants report being ignored when attempting to resolve disputes or address urgent maintenance concerns, leaving them to handle distressing living conditions independently.</p><p>Among the reviews are serious allegations that Access Real Estate Services took advantage of financially vulnerable tenants, particularly targeting college students through opaque and misleading agreements. There are accounts of tenants feeling financially exploited and manipulated, with the company reportedly more focused on profit generation than providing a basic level of care and service. In several instances, property issues were inadequately addressed, resulting in some tenants taking legal actions against the company. These narratives, often left unanswered by owner responses, contribute to a highly negative perception that lingers among certain renters.</p></section>"
