Took my emotional support animals to pound and didn't tell me. My child was unable to get any of her things. They would rather pay someone to come throw all our things away instead of letting us get them. Lost family pictures, social security cards, birth certificates. Came and changed locks when we left to meet with organization to try and help us. Do not recommend.",
