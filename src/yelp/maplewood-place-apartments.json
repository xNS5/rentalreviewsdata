      "review": "Cheap apartments but you get what you pay for. Management not on site. They give no cares about any problems that arise(which many will that are most likely not your doing) and in fact they will  most likely turn it around to make it about you and how it's your fault and your responsibility. The neighbors alone will make you cringe. Noise at all hours, definitely drugs dealers who have people going in and out. Parking lot is beyond small for all that live there, good luck trying to even fit a regular sized car in those parking spots when it's full. Good luck not getting your car smashed or scratched because others that live there do not understand how to back out or enter such small spaces. Management does a horrible job at communicating all together to new tenants, so if you work late and the only spot you pay for has been taken by someone else. There's nothing you can do. Overflow is always full and street parking as well. So you're looking at illegally parking at the Free masons lodge across the street or miles away from your apartment. Enjoy the cold! It isn't until you ask management to get on the apartment towing list to be able to actually call the tow company and get a car towed out of your spot, not on your dime, when such things happen. But after that happens the first time, good luck not getting your car keyed. There are many who try to warn others about Apex, heed their warning, unlike me who didn't. I will be posting pictures of obvious no goes on this place.",
