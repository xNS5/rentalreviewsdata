We felt super supported and they made, what I'm sure can be a very grueling process for some, incredibly smooth. They worked as a cohesive team and by extension, they made us feel a part of a team. They were always quick to respond to any questions and took extra time to make sure we felt heard and understood. We were very impressed with their knowledge, expertise, and efficiency - and they're also just great people!",

He has so much local knowledge, he takes the time to understand what you are looking for in a home, sets realistic expectations, and is an honest realtor. When the sellers agent of the home we got was completely non-responsive to us in the high stakes moment, he handled it very professionally and leveraged other resources in order to get our deal locked in and secured us the home. These situations can be very stressful and he surprised us with the awesome news that made our lives entirely better. Even post-sale, his organization and attention to detail helping us setup utilities etc. everything was wonderful! Chris rocks and we will definitely work with him for any real estate needs in our future!",

My wife and I were first time home buyers with a tight budget and no knowledge of how real estate purchases work. Leo was very insightful and provided a lot of guidance and tips on what to look for when buying a home and how the process works. Leo and his team helped us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way. Once we found something we loved, he helped us negotiate to beat other offers, all without increasing our offer price! A great thing about working with Leo is he has awesome connections including contractors, home inspectors, and lenders that were all super great to work with, and could get something done in a time crunch. I highly recommend working with Leo to buy your next home!",

His quick response times, flexibility, and willingness to accommodate my schedule were greatly appreciated, especially with our countless home viewings and three offers. His guidance and communication were top-notch, and I felt informed and reassured throughout the entire process even as a first-time home buyer. In the 10 months we worked together, I never felt rushed or pressured into making any quick decisions.\n\nMax's genuine personality and positivity made what could have been an extremely stressful experience enjoyable. I can't recommend him enough to anyone in need of a reliable, trustworthy, and hard-working realtor. Thank you Max for making my dreams of finally owning my own place a reality!",

        "review": "Perhaps would've been a different experience with buying a home, but I bought some land and Leo acted as the listing and selling agent, which was probably a mistake on our end, as he clearly acted in the best interest of the seller. I get it, more money to be made, but they used cheap sales tactics on us because they knew we wanted the land (i.e., someone already made an offer). Also, false advertising in the listing itself, as the HOA was recorded as being $70, when in fact it was almost twice the amount. Biggest disappointed was the lack of communication - twice I had to clarify something in the contract, which he and his team finally amended right before closing, but this was after calling out parts of the contract that contradicted what he had been telling us + huge gaps in response time. When I finally closed, he and his team never notified me, which is probably the biggest red flag, as it is best practice for a selling agent to notify their clients when the sale is officially recorded. Again, we were a small fry in comparison to a house sale, but knowing that we overpaid for this land (and I'm sure they knew that too), a congrats email or something would've been nice. So I cannot recommend this company, as it seems good customer service comes with a price tag!",

We take a lot of pride in how we operate, communicate and take care of our clients.\n\nI provided the various disclosures so that all parties were fully aware of all options, information and next steps upfront and in writing. I am more than happy to address any specific concerns via phone or in person vs a public forum. I genuinely wish you the best with your new property.\n\n- Leo \n\n"

When my biological son was born we needed a bigger house.  Once again, Leo and the Cohen group sold my house for a massive profit to me which allowed me to get my wife our dream home.\n\nI couldn't be happier with Leo as a real estate agent and friend.

He quickly identified locations and house attributes that fit our needs, wants and budget.\n* Leo was informative. He explained every step of the process patiently and thoroughly. He was swift to point out the positives and negatives of each house that we visited. We really appreciated all of his feedback.\n* Leo was straightforward and efficient when we decided to submit an offer. He analyzed neighborhood sales records and provided data-driven recommendations to ensure that we put forward the strongest offer possible. Our final offer was accepted mainly due to Leo's guidance and structure.\n* Leo has good, strong relationships with other agents in the community. He worked very well with the selling agents of the houses we were interested in.\n* Leo has worked and lived in the market for a long time. He also went through the process very recently for his family home. There's no one better to trust!",

In the end we bought a house that was pretty much exactly what we were looking for and I am sure that would not have been possible without Leo's help.\n\nAs first time homebuyers we didn't know much about the process of buying a house. Combine that with the crazy market and it can be pretty overwhelming. From day 1 Leo took the time to explain the process and understand what we were looking for. He never pushed us into something we weren't excited about but took the time to see a lot of houses with us so we could get a better sense of what we wanted. When it came time to put an offer on the house he did a good job of explaining the process and how we could make our offer stronger.\n\nLeo also has a good relationship with Ground Up Inspections and would help us setup pre-inspections on houses we wanted to put an offer on. In a market where you may have a couple days between seeing the house and putting in an offer this was incredibly helpful because it allowed us to feel confident that we were making the right decision.",

My time-frame for purchase was unexpectedly and drastically reduced during the process, leaving only 10 days under the loan option. With only 10 days to find a home, my agent, Leo Cohen, worked around the clock, traveled to multiple counties, worked every angle, he even went to houses on my behalf when I was unavailable due to work. In the face of a highly competitive market and a narrow timeline, Leo made it happen. I just closed on my first home.\n\nAt this time, Christopher Lee, Director of Operations, came into the picture and he brought nothing but sunshine. Very few people are capable of bringing enthusiasm into the financial intricacies of a home purchase, and Chris is one of those people. Leo and Chris quickly became like family to me and I am eternally grateful for all that they have done.

        "review": "A friend recommended Leo and the Cohen Group when we were planning our home sale in another state. We're so grateful to have found Leo as our buyer's agent. We knew only a little about Bellingham from previous visits, and we hadn't even listed our previous home yet, so there were a lot of unknowns, and we were feeling pretty stressed. This was at the height of the bidding-war craziness, right before the Fed started raising rates, and the market was anyone's guess. From day one, Leo had our trust. He was a calming, realistic, and knowledgeable guide. As a long-time Bellingham-ian himself, he knew neighborhoods and builders, had a clear idea of price-to-value for a given home, and he had a lot of experience with purchasing strategies. We never felt rushed, and we always felt like he just wanted us to find the right home. Leo took the time to figure out what WE wanted and steered us in productive directions. He and his team were timely and proactive communicators at every step of the process (even out of state, well before we could start looking for a place in person), and he patiently handled every question and concern we threw at him. He also helped us find a short-term rental that didn't cost a fortune. That saved our bacon! Really helped us be here and look around without feeling rushed. We couldn't be more pleased with Leo and his team, and we'll recommend them to anyone who's considering a move to the Bham area.",

Of course, some were not-so-fantastic, but let's not dwell on them!\n\nI cyberstalked Leo online and liked the \"vibe\" I saw on social media and other publications. I liked that his group liked working together, and instead of talking about community, these people had actual events around town to build community.\n\nWhat a fantastic surprise to find out they are all EXACTLY like they seem online. Leo and his gang of happy agents, marketers, researchers, and all-around helpful types came through for me. The most important part is their honesty and directness - you need that when making such big decisions.\n\nPlus, they are all just lovely people. I hope this doesn't get me in trouble, but Chris notarized things for me along the way, and Leo helped me with my move. That's way more than service, that is neighborliness.

We are not local to Bellingham but were looking for an investment property in the area. Initially we didn't have a realtor so we showed up at a listing I found on Zillow hoping to scope out the neighborhood and peak through the windows. Max happened to be showing another client the listing and welcomed us into the home to have a peak around. He gave us his card and the rest is history.\n\nSince we are not local, Max would do Facetime showings with us and record detailed videos of the homes that we were interested in. He also did a lot of research to ensure that the CC&Rs for the communities we were interested in would allow for our investment property. He was so patient with us - we met him in October and didn't find the perfect property until March.

He knows the area and regulations for the different zones etc. He is hungry but not pushy, on-top of it but not hyperactive. I could go on... maybe I already have... but Leo is a a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend him as someone who cares about your purchase/sale (and all the emotions, stress and excitement behind it) and he cares about you during the process.",

This was our first experience as homebuyers and Chris held our hand the entire time.  I dont think Ive ever experienced the kind of customer service he provided us.  He immediately contacted us after we were referred to him by work friends.  He never left our side.  I heard from him nearly everyday during the process, sometimes just to check in and ask how we were feeling or if we needed to talk about the stress of buying a home.  We developed a warm friendship and he got us in touch with an amazing circle of professionals that treated us to the same unique customer service.

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>The Bellingham Real Estate Co. has garnered numerous positive reviews, emphasizing their exceptional service and professionalism. Many users praised the responsiveness and dedication of their agents, particularly highlighting Leo Cohen and his team. For instance, a user described their experience as stress-free, facilitated by thorough communication and expert advice during the home buying process.</p><p>This sentiment was echoed by others who noted how the team\u2019s local knowledge significantly eased their transition into homeownership. Reviewers consistently mentioned how comfortable they felt with their agents, who were described as personable and attentive. Overall, the company's strong customer service ethic seems to be a common thread in positive user reviews.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>User reviews reveal that Bellingham Real Estate Co. is not just good; they excel in creating genuine and supportive relationships with their clients. Reviewers often mentioned how their agents went above and beyond in ensuring a smooth transaction, often noting the high level of professionalism alongside a personal touch. A particularly noteworthy review praised Leo and his team for their ability to handle multiple offers and complex negotiations, leading to successful outcomes for their clients.</p><pAdditionally, the company's commitment to community involvement, such as charitable contributions from sales, further enhances its reputation. Reviewers have expressed their appreciation for not just the professional services received, but for being part of a business that invests in positive local initiatives. This level of engagement indicates a strong alignment between the company's operations and the community values.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><pDespite the overwhelmingly positive feedback, there is a notable negative review that highlights significant communication issues during a land purchase. One user felt that their agent prioritized the seller's interests, leading to an overall disappointing experience. This included delays in contract clarification and a lack of updates, culminating in the user feeling neglected in the process. They specifically pointed to the absence of communication once the property was closed as a major red flag.</p><pThis isolated incident suggests that while the team often excels in client relations, there may be inconsistencies in their service, particularly when clients feel they are not the focus. Nevertheless, this review appears to be an outlier when considering the overall enthusiasm expressed by the majority of other users regarding their experiences with the agency.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pUpon reviewing the collected feedback, it's evident that the Bellingham Real Estate Co. has generally avoided serious pitfalls that would warrant an \"ugly\" section. However, the one negative experience reported sheds light on potential oversights in service quality that could be considered troubling. The review pointed out the feeling of being sidelined during the transaction, especially concerning communication, which is critical in real estate dealings.</p><pThe agent's focus on securing the seller's interests at the expense of their own client's satisfaction raised concerns about the overall integrity of the service given in this specific case. While this negative experience is not representative of the company's operations, it serves as a cautionary tale for potential clients to ensure they have open lines of communication throughout their transaction.</p></section>"
