        "review": "I was a resident of the Foothills property for 3 years, during which I had many unfortunate interactions with the Royce Group management. I was targeted for a few dead plants at the end of season while allowing other properties to look disorderly with no resolution. I believe this was largely based on my age (in my 60s). They aggressively targeted me for things that were not even my property without asking like a civilized adult. They assumed that a TV left in the parking area was mine and threatened to fine me for its disposal. At the time, I didnt even own a TV.\nThey Impounded my car and lied about it. Despite knowing exactly where I lived, they placed a sticker on my car facing away from where it would be easily noticeable over the weekend. When confronted they said that it was towed because it was inoperable (a lie as I had driven it out of impound). They then tried to lie saying it was because the tabs were expired (also NOT the case). They did not make any attempt to call me, knock on my door, or show any good faith attempt to resolve the issue before towing. Only reason I did not sue was because my daughter found a technicality in the lease stating that they could do that if the vehicle had any disrepair ( one of my windows did not roll up all the way and my bumper had some tape on it). All of this while allowing multiple other vehicles to remain on the property without having been moved for months. This was definitely an act of aggression based on impoverished appearances. They show disdain for people of lower income. Despite that, they themselves do not keep up their own property.\nFailure to light pathways caused me to fall showing that they did not care about the safety of their tenants  as well as car damaging pot holes that they were informed of multiple times and did nothing for the entire duration of my tenancy. They continuously raised the rent despite not investing it in making their property a nice place to live for the price. They also offered a swimming pool in their advertisement which remained empty for the majority of my tenancy then was filled in with dirt (false advertising amenities). The maintenance staff were incredibly courteous and went out of their way to help. They deserve more professional employers. The dwelling itself was alright, nice storage. The place has a lot of potential to be very nice if it werent for the deplorable behaviors of their management team.",

        "review": "I have a good friend who has lived at the Foothills for 10 years. She is nearly 70 years old and has a 34 year old mentally ill son she cares for 24 hours a day. He has schizophrenia and sometimes talks out loud to the voices in his head. He is a sweet young man when stabilized and totally harmless. A new neighbor heard him carrying on a conversation with himself and got frightened. She complained to the office and they are now in the process of being evicted.\nLast October, her upstairs hot water heater exploded and flooded the upstairs bathroom and the kitchen on lower level. There is no flooring or sink in upstairs bathroom, and no kitchen sink, cupboards, or counter in the kitchen. They provided her a small wash basin to do dishes. She has continued to pay rent and continued living in these terrible conditions for 5 months.\nShe is soon to be homeless, as she can not find a place to rent. This entire situation is atrocious and should be illegal.",
