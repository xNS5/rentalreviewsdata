        "review": "I am so grateful to have worked with Michelle and James to find our new family home. They were incredible supports working with us on our out-of-state move, making sure that everything from financing to showings were in sync with our familys tight timeline. We could not have asked for better agents who took the time to really listen to and understand our needs, pre-vetted properties, thoughtfully answered questions around the clock, and were strategic in setting up offers that helped us land an incredible property for our family. Thank you, Michelle and James! It was pleasure and I couldnt recommend them more.",

Their diligence, responsiveness, and sense of calm guided through the process with relative ease. We closed in a little over 3 weeks to have the most magical weekend in our new home. Thank you Michelle and James for taking this journey with us. You are  both knowledgeable and skilled at what you do and your vibe as humans deserves to be known and appreciated. Thanks again.\nGil and Sunlight.",

Once we had the right house in our sights, Louisa absolutely crushed it getting the deal done! Hopefully we will not be buying a house again anytime soon, but if the need was to arise, Prosper Northwest would be our first call!",

        "review": "We had a FIVE STAR experience working with Dave and the NW Real Estate Team. We had the opposite of a turnkey property. An old cabin that had not been on the market since the 1950's. Dave was able to navigate us through the preparation process as we updated the key components of the property to best position it for listing. We had to invest minimal capital and received a fair market value for our cabin. I believe both us as the seller, and the buyer, were pleased with NW Real Estate Team with the end result.",

We loved the way he showcased our cabin with staging and beautiful photography. Dave secured us a full price cash offer within a couple of days after listing! We highly recommend Dave as a realtor who will devote his attention to all those little details that will help bring in a fast sale.",

        "review": "Working with Dave Faigin on the sale of my property was a breeze! It needed some basic repairs before we listed it, and Dave had his team of experts out to take care of the needful within 24 hours. As with any major real estate transaction, there were questions, concerns, and strategic decisions to be made along the way. Under Dave's guidance, each of these things was addressed quickly, efficiently, and effectively. It was my preference to stay close to the action to help out where I could, but I could have taken my hands completely off the wheel and things would have been just fine - Dave and his team had everything handled. If I had to do it all over again, without a doubt I'd pick Dave to handle this sale, hands down.",

        "review": "Calling Paul Rice an amazing realtor would not do him justicehe is so much more than that. He led my wife and I through the longest, most excruciating land purchase process imaginable, one filled with multiple sellers, a late property add, a boundary dispute, lawyer showdowns, wetland restrictions, zoning gotchas, an incredibly unhelpful lending officer and a closing process that dragged on months longer than expected. Paul navigated us through this storm with incredible patience, grace and when needed, some well-directed nudging. His talent and persistence turned what could have been a truly awful process and a failed transaction into a successful closingand now we get to build our forever home. Unwavering Real Estate Spirit Guide or Sagacious Sherpa to your Dreams would be a better title to put on his business card than realtor.",

From day 1, Dave was extremely responsive and had great suggestions for funding our purchase. Land can be a bit tricky and oftentimes comes with a lot of red tape,especiallywhen near a river. Dave helped us navigate the existing documentation and reached out to some local specialistson our behalf for their opinion as well. Ultimately, we felt comfortable with the purchase and decidedto move forward. We were impressed with Dave's professionalism and his genuine interest in assuring we were satisfied with our final decision on our new land. We look forward to working with him in the future.",

The team there listens carefully, understands my criteria, proposes ideas that match, but also comes through with creative and insightful ideas that had not occurred to me. Every transaction has been well-managed and seamless, due to Prosper's expert handling of negotiations and paperwork, and strong network of responsive and effective supporting professionals for title, legal, escrow, and lending.  Highly recommended.",

        "review": "Integrity, dependability, trustworthy. These are a few of the characteristics Kat Larson maintains.  She came onboard and navigated the completion of a contract gone awry.  I won't use this arena to speak negatively of my experience prior Kat's involvement, but I will speak of her ability to jump in full throttle, advocate for me (the buyer) and ultimately close the deal. Home buying is an already stressful (and exciting) event. When, at 12 days in, I was in dire need of a new agent, Kat provided comfort, confidence, and professional assertion until closure.  I am so grateful to be in my new home; thanks to Kat. I highly recommend her!!",

If youre wanting TOP notch attentiveness, people who really go beyond the above and beyond, and people that get it done and get it done right, look no further my friend. Im so happy Louisa came into our lives when she did because from the start she made me feel safe about selling, then turning around and buying in this crazy market all while newly pregnant. I truly believe that quality is hard to find in a realtor let alone the whole team! These are honest and good people, with morals and good hearts. Were grateful  and now were happy in our new home too! ",
