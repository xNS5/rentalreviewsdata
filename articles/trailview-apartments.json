One user review mentions the prevalence of cigarette smoke around the premises, which is particularly alarming due to the presence of a daycare center within the building. This suggests that Trailview Apartments may need to address smoking policies and their enforcement to ensure a healthful environment for all residents.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The solitary review for Trailview Apartments indicates a significant concern, pointing out a potentially dangerous situation for children being exposed to secondhand smoke. While the review doesn't provide detailed feedback on how the property management responds to complaints, the mention of such an issue is concerning. The lack of an owner response to this review does not instill confidence in their communication practices or consideration for tenants' well-being, hinting at a broader problem in property management responsiveness and tenant care.</p></section>"
