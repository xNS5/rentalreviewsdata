If I could give 0 stars I would.\n\nFirst, they let a roommate not pay rent and did't even try to contact the cosigner to make them pay. They could have taken money out of the security deposit but no they made my daughter and her roommates pay for the 4th person when they suddenly moved out. They gave no leniency and just made the people staying in the house figure it out. The person at the front desk (Amber Terry) said \"That's not our problem.\" How unprofessional and Pure was never helpful.\n\nSecond, Rebeka Chadwell let squatters live in the house for 5 months and did not do anything when she was notified. This was very unsafe and these squatters made copies of the house keys and could have given them out to anyone. Anyone could have gotten into the house and that could have been a bad situation.\n\nTLDR: Pure property allows squatters to live in the apartments/houses and offer no help when they are asked.",

We just signed our third lease with them, and though we've only paid rent late once, they were understanding and empathetic during that hard time. They have a very balanced approach to management  they're not overly invasive, but do keep up with the property, always with notice. Their monthly rent is reasonable in the current economic climate (any time I've seen a property on CL, rent with SR has been lower than other similar homes in the area), and they haven't hiked rent on us. They're great at communicating when inspections will be or when anything important comes up, and they've been great about responding to maintenance requests when needed. Son-Rise has been the best property management company I've ever rented with and I'm glad to continue renting with them.",

Taking over from the last company, they have done the impressive task of making Son-Rise a proactive business. Issues ranging from toilet not flushing, constant leaking with freezer and fridge and a washer and dryer who would simply not work. I would not recommend a single person to live in anything with the this company, as it is clear they only care to help when the issue may reflect poorly on them.

I paid rent on time, occasionally a few days late but never had problems with fees. They weren't very good about posting access days during remodeling under the new owner, and occasionally had trouble keeping the washer/dryer running. They did refund me the quarters I lost in the machine though, and even gave me an extra one for the trouble. Delivered right to my door, too. :)\n\nThey were totally on board with a month-to-month arrangement after the lease expired recently, which is great while I search for a job and figure out where I'm moving to.\n\nCan't say too much about them other than that they never bothered me much, but I'm a pretty good tenant, generally. Like most Bellingham managers, there's always someone else to fill the apartment so you don't have a lot of leverage.\n\nHopefully there won't be any issues with the deposit when I leave.",

        "review": "I have had the BEST experience so far with Son-Rise. I had spent hundreds of dollars on applying for apartments through other Property Management companies (even signed a lease and paid a deposit but was taken off of the lease without my knowledge) and was getting very frustrated. I found an adorable little apartment on their web site and contacted them via their web form, not expecting much. I was contacted for a viewing appointment RIGHT AWAY and when I viewed the apartment, was told that I might not make enough money to afford the apartment. Disheartened, I went to their office anyhow to apply. The Property Manager told me that I did make enough and I should apply right away. Much to my surprise and joy, I found out that they ONLY ACCEPT ONE APPLICATION AT A TIME!! So since I had applied, they wouldn't even SHOW the apartment to anyone else!! I was ecstatic. They told me that I wouldn't find out for a week due to the onslaught of applications they had. I needed to move in by the following weekend and was incredibly stressed. But they called me RIGHT AWAY and said that I had gotten the apartment, and I could sign the lease the following business day! I signed the lease, got my keys, easy as that! Now, if that wasn't enough for me to love them--after I moved in, I realized that the lock on the door wasn't enough for me to feel secure. (Just a deadbolt, no other locking mechanism). I emailed my property manager and she had a chain lock installed THE NEXT DAY. On top of THAT, the vertical slatted blinds were old and falling down when I moved in. I didn't notice until the week after, when two of them broke off. I put in a maintenance request through their web site on Thursday, not expecting them to care or fix it. I was planning on fixing them myself after the weekend if I didn't hear from them. The office called me on Friday and said that they would take a look and fix it as soon as possible, but they had so many requests in that it probably wouldn't be for two weeks. I told her that sooner rather than later would be amazing because people could see into my apartment, and she said she would do her best. I went away for the weekend and came home on Sunday to find the ENTIRE thing replaced!!! Needless to say, I have been respected, treated kindly, and overall overjoyed to be renting from Son-Rise.",

When we handed in our deposit and gave them the date we would be moving in, she said she would write it on the calendar and that were all set to move in on that day.  We showed up on that day and apparently she didn't write it in and played it off like we never told her the day.  We had all the people ready to help us move and a moving truck already rented and we were told we had to wait the next day.  I had to make it clear that was impossible since everyone worked the next day.  We had to wait for the lease to be prepared and someone to inspect the apartment.\n\nAnytime I had to speak to her on the phone, she was beyond disrespectful over simple questions and gave me incorrect information constantly.\n\nI do not understand how she wasn't fired for the first problem.

When I needed to rent this property I contacted Son-Rise on the advise of a friend, and I couldn't be more satisfied. When I first listed it, the owner (Joan), came to the house with me and advised me on improvements to make (fresh paint, carpet, etc.).  It rented in a timely fashion even though the market was not great, and I got a fabulous tenant who has been there ever since.  During this time every issue that either I or my tenant had was addressed very promptly. I have been advised of every repair needed, but they handle it all.  I would heartily recommend them to anyone, and will use them again if I have any more rentals.",

This company is by far one of the most sued property management companies in the county. They rip off their tenants with high prices, lack of intent to fix basic living necessities that arise in units, coverup piss units by peeling back the carpet and painting under the corners instead of removing the carpets and the list goes on. They treat their vendors who do work on the units as if they are slaves. I know of one particular lady who has been there a while that might do the company a favor if she moves on.",

There is only one person in the whole office that can do anything associated with our building. If she is unavailable there is noone capable of handling any concern.\n\nI have multiple stories about how completely illogical they are about handling issues. The latest being a lockbox I had attached to the front gate that was suddenly missing one day. I was first told by the Keystone contact that Son-rise knew nothing about it. The next day I was told by the same person that they had previously tried to contact the owners of the boxes, but they weren't sure who some of them belonged to. It's pretty logical that they belonged to owners/tenants in the building. It also seems like it should be pretty easy to send a group email/contact the owners.",

It was a shocking news to me that he got the apt with the same stains, spots and holes on carpets and walls!!!!!!!\nWell done Son-Rise.

Not only that we fixed several broken lights, a broken closet door, a stain on the ceiling and the base board heaters (there where all things that where broken when we moved in) We scrubbed the already clean appartment.\n\nOur deposit was $895 today we recieved $325.\n\nIf a cleaning company is taking 8 hours to clean a 650 sq ft apartment then they need to get some new management and new staff that's just insane.\n\nWe are now happy home owners but would like to share this terrible experience with Son Rise in Bellingham and highly reccomend avoiding them if possible.",

At this time, I am still in the process of working with PURE Property Management and getting things finalized for the place that I will be renting out at the end of the month. At this time, both Rose and Rebeka have been super helpful and a delight to work with. I am impressed with their communication and willingness to work with me as we get everything finalized and processed for the rental property. Rose has been very supportive and informative in my application process and same with Rebeka, and that has been a huge help in making sure all the items get actioned and completed in a timely manner as well as ensuring that my concerns and questions get answered and addressed prior to my partner and I moving in to the property.",

A soon as we got a hold of someone we got hit with a 'we decided to now renew your lease\" we have told them about our own dog being attacked by our neighbors aggressive poodle and had go out a buy a gun so if the guys dog tries to attack again we now have the right to shoot to kill his dog! now the property owners deserves to be held accountable for these unhabitable living conditions! All this happened in the last 2 years I been living here and my former roommate has moved out. All Son-Rise says \"well since you were on a partial moveout were not going to look at any of your maintenance requests\" SON-RISE property does discriminate against!\n\noh their new maintance guy is shitty! says if he has to come in a fix something  that isn't needing to be fixed he will falsely report as we broke it.",

We understand that humans are imperfect, and that we all are trying our best, but we want to warn the rest of the Bellingham community to stay away from Son-Rise.***\n\nThis was the worst experience I've ever had at a property management. My husband and I applied for a house with Son-Rise, along with one of our friends as a roommate. After 3 days of silence post submission of our applications, we reached out only to hear that we had \"missing items\" from our application. (This struck me as unprofessional, and awkward seeing that I was the one who had to seek THEM out to hear what I was missing versus the other way around.) Two days after we retrieved the missing items from our application, (items weren't even really missing, just lost in their emails) I called them back to see what our status was (since I didn't ever get a call from them) and found out there was yet ANOTHER item we were \"missing.\" Twice I had to reach out to find what we owed. Twice they were vague about the items we needed to complete this process. After two more weeks of playing tag with this property management, we found out we needed a co-signer. After we sent in the application for the co-signer, they reached out (FINALLY) saying we needed to track down our rental reference, because they themselves couldn't get ahold of them. It has been another week since we got all of the loose ends tied up, and we still have not heard back from Son-Rise about the property. Not only was our time and money wasted, it was unappreciated. Such an awful experience with a property manager who couldn't care less about the livelihood of future tenants.",

She is horrible at her job and should be removed from her position immediately. She takes sides in neighbor disputes and is the most condescending and rude a hole I have ever had the misfortune of speaking with. The way that she speaks to people (and I am one of four other people who have said similar things about her) is never okay in any situation, but as someone who works for the owners of the condo she should definitely not be rude to owners. If you ask her a question, she acts like the whole world is falling apart and speaks to you like you're a child. Selling the condo was the best thing I ever did, and I celebrate never having to look at her or speak to her again. Cheers!!",

I had appliances break (dishwashers) in each apartment. They were replaced promptly and it was not taken out of my deposit. They were lenient and charged no fee for the one time we were late paying rent. It was only a day late, but still.  I got my full deposit back (minus like $10) from each house. The key is to remember the details; windows and sills, behind appliances, inside cabinets, etc. They give you a list, it's super easy. \n\nThe two problems I ever had both involved the parking lot. 1) SonRise will never call a tow-truck company to move cars without passes. 2) When it snows they do not shovel and only sometimes salt. If you plan on living in one of their units take some initiative and sweep/shovel your own stairs and walk ways and move your cars to street parking when the flakes start falling if you want to get out the next morning.",

I have rented at places in Miami, Los Angeles, Laguna Beach and Scottsdale which all are high well educated places. Ever since I started renting from this company it's been nothing but a hassle first week of renting their asked to up my rent because they had made a mistake on the price and asked for more money? Then I had signed a six-month lease with the option to renew for another year after living here for 60 days they had told me the owner is selling the place and I will not be able to re-sign my lease for another year. And then as a renter it is my job to maintain the yard as in no trash don't make it look sloppy if my grass is a little too long that's my opinion and I have got asked to cut the grass for the realtor to stage photos which I will be leaving in 10 days and I'm traveling in those 10 days while trying to move there telling me if I don't they're taking it out of my damage deposit which isn't right. I have a life and my life isn't mowing the grass if it's too long as a realtor or management company that's their responsibility they think it's out of control.

        "review": "Lived in one of their brand new houses for a total of 2 years. As for bothering tenants they are fine, barely interacted with us. Yet the company is extremely unprofessional. To start, we were told when moving in \"We installed wood chips so that yard work will not be involved with the house\" then later received a notification that we needed to remove weeds that were growing. Glad they gave us an unusable heinous yard yet still expected us to maintain it like it was grass. They did inform us 24 hours in advance of yearly inspection, but they never informed us when the owner would randomly show up. A few times the owner would show up at our door without giving us any prior knowledge and inform us he was there to replace a filter or something (we always let him in because the owner is actually a super awesome guy, son-rise is the problem). We also informed them that our glass chandelier broke when our tall roommate hit it with his head, they never helped us fix or replace it, yet charged us at the end. We told them we were moving out 3 months before the end of the lease, which they forgot about until we had to remind them 10 days before our move-out. Now for the real KICKER: we put a couple thousand dollars down in the deposit. When we moved out we asked them when we would receive it. They said \"we have 21 days until we have to send it\". A month later I asked where it was and there response was \"Since no one informed us of an address to send it to, we mailed it to the house you leased from us.\" YES! Son-rise mailed an extremely valuable check to a VACANT house which is up for rent even though they have permanent addresses from the 3 people on the lease. Communicating with this company slightly feels like you are talking to a kindergarten class. Nice in person but I swear to god, behind closed doors they are as chaotic as a propane factory hosting a fireball juggling tournament. Bellingham rental companies are not the best and take advantage of college kids, so pick your poison.",

We mowed our lawn every few weeks but they kept charging us as if they had to pay someone for lawn service. When we moved out we cleaned the house and garage way better than it was before we moved in. They charged us for 12 hours of 'cleaning', batteries, carpet cleaning (there was one room with carpet) and other random fees I've never experienced before. We made sure all batteries and lights worked before we left, and We scrubbed that housed. I called them and they were extremely rude, told me they couldn't do a walk through with us because someone else had moved in already. And then hung up on me. Very Christ like.

When we moved out they kept half of our deposit for cleaning even though we thoroughly scrubbed the house and I have never had my deposit withheld from previous landlords. They put a bill on our account in error, told us twice that they would remove it since they agreed it was in error, never took it off, and then deducted that from our deposit as well. The most frustrating part however was how incredibly and consistently condescending they were to us, constantly referring to us as \"kids\" and \"college students\" when my roommates and I are graduate students and teachers in our late 20's and early 30's. They seemed to think we were idiots who had never rented before. When I informed them that the house had mold (our lease said that they would take care of mold) they kept telling me that it probably wasn't mold and I was just confused about what mold looked like. If you do rent from them be sure to well document everything and get things in writing, especially if you are younger since they seem to see that as an opportunity to take advantage of you. \nMight be helpful:\nhttp://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights",

Basically, this is just another one of those realty companies that does whatever possible to take money from defenseless tenants. When  we finally moved out they ended up charging us for the time the apartment was vacant even though we had specifically asked them if they would only charge us to the day we vacated.

        "review": "Renter beware. My wife and I just finished renting from Son-Rise in August. We had nothing but issues in our dealings with this rental company. I can provide proof for nearly all of my issues below. \nHere is why I would steer clear of Son-Rise:\n- Unit was never cleaned prior to moving in\n- Water stains on floor of unit had not been fixed as I was told they had been\n- Dishwasher never worked properly\n- Numerous light bulbs were burned out when I moved in\n- Fixing my hot water heater took 3 visits from two different maintenance men\n- A bullet hole that occurred in my wall was never repaired. At first I was told it would be my cost to fix as it was not a result of the units owner. When I pressed the issue, Son-Rise agreed to fix it at their cost. It was never repaired while I lived in the unit.\n- Upon terminating my lease (admittedly late, but only by three days) I was responsible for September's rent (moved out in August). Within the rights of Washington Landlord-Tenant law.\n- Paid September rent knowing our unit had been viewed by multiple people and an application had been submitted prior to the end of August.\n- Was never informed when a new lease was signed (When a new lease is signed, I would be due a prorated amount of September's rent).\n- I found out a new renter was in the unit when I contacted the energy company to arrange my last bill.\n- I was only refunded rent when I contacted Son-Rise and pressed the issue about the rent as well as some absurd charges made on my deposit (fire alarm batteries for $45?)\n-Oh, beware of the automatic $25 taken out of your deposit as \"Administrative Fee\"\n\nSome other items to be warned about are the poorly written lease (several sections seem to say one thing, but Son-Rise interprets them another). The company overworks their employees (in my opinion) and this slows down all action on maintenance requests outside of legally required responses (so water/electric/heat) as well as any inquiries. I could continue, but would begin entering my personal feelings and not fact. The only reason that I gave Son-Rise two stars is that the rent was easily cheaper by $100 a month than elsewhere and that they did end up refunding the rent due to me in addition to most of the charges to my deposit (and I still contend they owe me all but the $25, but getting that would cost me a lawyer and that costs more than the other charges)",

        "review": "I have been renting from them for over a year...and now we are having a plumbing issue. I work at Gary's Plumbing and Heating and we have amazing technicians and trust their work. We are licensed and bonded just to note. On the phone to the front desk lady I was calling in my plumbing issue and asked ya know \"hey I work at Gary's Plumbing and Heating and is there anyway...\" Didn't even get to finish my sentence before she cut me off and said \"they have to be licensed and bonded\" and I said \"Oh of course they are..\" cut off again I got to hear \"Um yea, so no\". Rude much? And when she asked is it okay for us to enter your home while you're not there and I said no, I'd would like to be there, she almost sounded like \"well.....okaaaaay\". Yes, well okay...do not enter my home without my permission while I am not there. End of story. So now I'm a little apprehensive whether they will actually follow what I asked and hope I don't show up from work to see someone I don't know in my house.",
