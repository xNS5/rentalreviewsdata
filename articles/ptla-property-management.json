        "review": "I have been trying for days to get in touch with anyone in the office. Our hot water froze during the last cold snap and because of a design flaw the pipes ran in an exterior wall. The only solution was to put a small heater in the garage and it took 3 days for the weather to warm up and the pipes to thaw. By law they have 24hrs to find a solution. Secondly, I live in a 3 story townhome with the lower level consisting of a bedroom/bathroom and entry way. On a normal winter day the temperature cannot get above 62 degrees with full heat going. When it was cold outside it was 48 degrees on that level, I had to move my daughter out of her room and upstairs. On the upper 2 floors the the heat also struggled in the cold with the max heat being 62 on the very cold days. In speaking with others in the same type of unit in my complex they are also having the same difficulties with heat. This is a design flaw and cannot be rectified easily. PTLA has violated the tenancy law but not rectifying the situation in a timely manner. I have put in my notice to terminate my tenancy after 3 days of no hot water/adequate heat and have not heard anything from them. I have emailed, dropped off a letter, messaged through the portal and called and left a message. Not sure what else to do.",

The parking at this property is atrocious and after moving in, they decided to change our assigned parking spot to one that doesnt even fit our stock F150. After three months of being told they will work to find us a new spot, they now refuse to help. The on site garbage bin areas are filled with trash daily and trash all over the ground. Its very clear there has not been a community manager capable of running this property for some time now.\n\nDo not recommend.",

        "review": "Oh look, they made a new Google account to get rid of all their 1 star reviews! Perfect, I'll just copy and paste from my last 1 star review....\n\nSpend your money elsewhere... We moved into the brand new Crescent building that had and still has more issues than they know what to do with. If you can even get a hold of someone in their office they'll just play dumb and act sorry. Maintenance issues do not get addressed. Take your money elsewhere. They were and are not willing to work with us when we had unexpected life-issues come up forcing us to move, they just care about getting their overpriced rent. Maintenance and snow removal are non existent, this past snow storm the sidewalks and parking spaces weren't touched. Sidewalks were not walkable, and the front door doesn't open so tenants were supposed to walk around the building on ice-covered sidewalks to get inside. One of the two elevators has been broken 6 of the 8 months we've lived here. Heating systems inside units aren't able to keep up, and they won't heat or fix the heat in the buildings hallways and common areas so our electric heat has to run 24/7. The units do not get warmer than 60 degrees. The \"Leasing agent\", Kylie, lied upon move in claiming the units have A/C. They do not. My fault for not checking, I guess I should have known I was being lied to. Winter temps are no warmer than 60 inside while summer temps are 90+ on the 5th floor. I guess I had decent expectations for almost $2000 a month  The grass was never cut in the summer, and poison plants were found around the building that are fatal for dogs. This once again was not taken care of. The walls are very poorly soundproofed so noise and music from neighbors goes right thru falls.\n\nUPDATE 01/06/2023\nPTLA HAS NOT reached out, instead someone got upset that the front door has been faulty for quite some time now, forcing everyone to walk around. The only handicapped door that is. And now someone ripped the door handle off. Id imagine this will take months for them to fix as well. Once again, do not rent here.\n\nUpdate 01/30/23\nThe streetlights and exterior walkway lights have been out for over a week now. You can hardly see anything in the parking lot or behind the building, must walk with a flashlight. Just a matter of time before all the local Bellingham tweekers that live in the woods next to the building come out and start smashing into car windows to steal stuff now that they dont have to worry about streetlights. Have to assume PTLA just hasnt paid the bill, theyre cheap (obviously).",

They have VERY sneaky wording in their lease renewals so watch out! They send out renewal contracts six months in advanced with decent deals so just be aware cause if you ignore those you will lose you place at the end of your lease. In regards to the actual unit at Elwood. Its beautiful. Marble counters, stainless steel appliances and in unit washer/dryer. The construction is near finished so you dont hear it that often anymore.

        "review": "Ive been here for 2 months, and I have nothing good to say about PTLA. For starters, the entire apartment was much smaller than advertised on the floor plan. About 2 square feet per room smaller. The washing machines went out for a week, and they did nothing to respond to our calls and emails, so we just had to wear dirty clothes. They didnt charge us for electricity until this month, when they dropped the 2 months of electricity bills on us at once, AFTER our rent had already been paid, then continued to charge us $5 per day of late fees without notifying us. We didnt notice this until it racked up to over $50. Then, of course, theyve continued to not respond to our emails or calls, and continually go out of office for extended periods of time. They are raising the rent, and making us sign the lease for next year in December. If we dont by the 8th, they are going to raise it again. If we don't by the end of the month, they will assume we arent renewing?? PTLA is an awful, selfish, money hungry business. Never trust them.",

Unfortunately, the laundry machines at your property are owned and managed by a third-party laundry company who will not allow us to do maintenance on the machines ourselves. However, if you ever have issues with the machines, you can contact their  customer support. We have signs in the laundry rooms with their contact information should you ever need assistance. \nWe did have an issue with the utilities charges this month, which has now been resolved. We are happy to reverse any late fees that were assessed because of this error if your account is otherwise in good standing.

        "review": "Tried to steal our entire security deposit after move out when we spent 2 full days with 6 people cleaning the apartment. I anticipated they might try this so I took a video upon move out to prove the state of the apartment was perfectly clean and in good order. It took the video proof, a lawyer, and calls and emails every single day to get them to return the deposit. If you must rent from them, take pictures/videos on move in and move out and be prepared to contact them every single day when they steal your deposit. Also CC their bosses on the emails so they get annoyed/embarrassed and respond back to you. Good luck and rent elsewhere if possible!!",

I had days where I called up to 6 times with no response or reply to voicemail or email. The property manager where I lived also rarely answered or returned calls.\n2. My unit was brand new when we started the rental.  The unit was covered in construction dust and had clearly not been cleaned.  We even found a doorstop in the freezer.\n3.  PTLA billed me for over 4 hours of cleaning (in addition to the carpet cleaning I had agreed to in the lease).  I sent PTLA multiple pictures of the clean apartment asking what the fee was for and noting that PTLA postmarked my refund over the time allowed by law.  PTLA then refunded the remainder of my deposit.\n\nIf renting with PTLA, I suggest documenting everything very thoroughly.  Take excessive photos, videos and follow up on phone calls via email.\n\nAlso, note that the reviews now only show as going back to Summer of 2023.  The old reviews are now missing.",

I have no qualms with maintenance. They respond quick and do what needs to be done. But the office took 6 months to process an application for your roommate. I started that process in January, my lease was up for renewal in May. May comes around, 3 days before the deadline for my lease renewal, they tell me my roommate isnt qualified. Ive live here 7 years and havent missed a month, and my past roommates had been even less qualified, so it made no sense. But, they waited till 3 days before my lease renewal deadline to say something, and then refused to give me an extension on that lease renewal timeline. I even pointed out to them that it took them 6 months to process the application. Another time I went into the office to pay my rent in person, they failed to tell me then that other one time fees had been added to my rent and that the check I was giving them would not suffice.

There was mold, fleas, the windows leaked, the basement flooded multiple times, washers backed up with black fluid, and there were three seperate gas leaks when I moved out. Maintenance requests were slow and as soon as you asked for something more than the bare minimum they stopped responding.\nElwood edge - when owership transferred PTLA lost my rent payments and proof of insurance and then tried to EVICT ME. This was after I notified them of the fact that a payment wasn't applied to my account.

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>    <heading><h2>Disclaimer</h2></heading>    <p>This article is generated by ChatGPT. The summary provided herein is based only on user reviews and is intended to be a tool to help potential customers in their decision-making process regarding a property management company or rental property. The content of this article reflects the balanced sentiment of those reviews without identifiable information, in keeping with user privacy.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>The Good</h2></heading>    <p>Among the user reviews for PTLA Property Management, there are accounts of positive experiences, where renters have praised the company\u2019s communication efforts and responsiveness to concerns. Some users have remarked on the helpfulness of individual staff members, noting their dedication to resolving issues and ensuring a smooth renting process. For example, one reviewer was appreciative of the quick turnaround in viewing properties and finding suitable alternatives when the initial selection didn't meet their needs.</p>    <p>Another highlight from user reviews includes instances where PTLA Property Management addressed specific issues promptly. Examples include quick responses to maintenance requests and direct assistance from staff in helping clients through various administrative procedures, such as switching electricity for move-ins. Positive experiences have helped in alleviating the stress associated with renting, and some users have acknowledged a sense of relief thanks to the efficiency and courtesy of select PTLA staff.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>The Great</h2></heading>    <p>A few reviewers have gone beyond reporting good service to describe their experience with PTLA Property Management as great. One user applauded the understanding and accommodating nature of the landlords, who were seen as compassionate about renters without a previous rental history. Another noted that immediate and lingering maintenance concerns were handled expediently and with professionalism, leaving a strong impression of respect for residents\u2019 living spaces and comfort.</p>    <p>Great experiences also extended to property conditions upon moving in. There have been specific mentions of well-maintained and clean units, with one user expressing their gratitude for the cleanliness of the apartment upon move-in. Furthermore, these positive experiences are sometimes attributed to the diligence and proactive approach of certain team members, contributing to a significant stress reduction for those in the middle of transitioning to a new home.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>The Bad</h2></heading>    <p>However, not all user reviews for PTLA Property Management reflect satisfaction. There are several complaints about difficulty reaching the company, with users stating they experienced delayed responses or complete lack of acknowledgment when dealing with substantial issues such as heating problems and hot water outages. Additionally, challenges such as unaddressed maintenance requests were a common theme, with some tenants waiting for extended periods for resolutions to their living conditions or getting partial solutions that didn't fully address the root problems.</p>    <p>From a procedural standpoint, users have criticized PTLA for poor communication regarding lease agreements, renewals, and terminations. Some noted that vital information was not conveyed timely or adequately, leading to frustration and unexpected financial or logistic consequences. The handling of security deposits has also been criticized, with instances where users claimed to struggle with the company either holding deposits without clear reasons or charging for unclear damages, leading to a need for persistent follow-ups and, in some cases, legal counsel.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>The Ugly</h2></heading>    <p>The uglier aspects of user experiences with PTLA Property Management point to more severe allegations of neglect and mismanagement. A number of users have reported unresolved and egregious issues such as persistent mold, major leaks, insect infestations, and inadequate heating during winter months. In several reviews, renters conveyed a sense that the company did not take these concerns seriously or failed to attend to them with the urgency that such hazardous conditions would merit.</p>    <p>Some users claimed to have experienced deceptive practices, with PTLA accused of mishandling rental payments, springing unexpected fees, and not fulfilling maintenance promises. Allegations of discrimination and a lack of transparency about property conditions prior to lease signing were also aired in the more critical reviews. It is important to note, however, that as with any company, these experiences may not represent the majority, and PTLA Property Management has responded to some user reviews, suggesting a willingness to address issues post-facto.</p>  </section></article>"
