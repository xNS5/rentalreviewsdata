I know this not an assisted living apartments, but most all non-assisted living apartments supply a few carts. Daylight Properties. Rudeness deluxe at Daylight Properties",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Thank you for your feedback, Tana. Daylight Properties owns and manages numerous buildings in Downtown Bellingham. We do not supply carts at any of our buildings for numerous reasons. We do encourage our Tenants to purchase their own form of cart to haul in groceries and other items into the building. It just so happens the Leopold Building where you reside is also occupied by the Hotel Leo. The Hotel Leo owns and manages their own carts for guests of the hotel. Daylight Properties does not own these carts.  \n\nPlease feel free to contact our office directly with any issues you may have as a resident of our Leopold Apartments. We want your residency to be a positive experience."

I lived in the Daylight building and though the building is old it is well maintained and cleaning is done daily M-F. Maintenance is quick to respond to requests and extremely nice. The Daylight Properties administration staff are a pleasure to deal with. Jena in the front office is professional and caring and has everyone's best interest in mind.",

        "review": "If you're retarded, and want your unit entered without the state law of 48 hours written notice, stick with these guys, maybe they'll put a fire sprinkler in your unit too after you complain, as none of their buildings are up to code",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "In the event of an emergency when time does not allow for 48 hours written notice, we do have the right to enter a unit as per our lease terms.  In this case, there was determined to be a leak coming from the newly installed fire suppressant system in one of the units and it was necessary to enter more than one unit to determine the source of the leak.\n\nIn cases when there is insufficient time to provide 48 hours written notice, we always attempt to contact the Tenant by phone to let them know what is going on. \n\nOur buildings are inspected annually to be sure they meet code standards.  This in turn led to the installation of a new fire suppressant system in 2015.  This process may have caused a temporary inconvenience to the residents, but the increased safety to our Tenants is more important."

        "review": "Wonderful experience as a residential tenant for almost 3 years. Everyone on the Daylight team is amazing from the office coordinators to the maintenance crew. I really enjoyed my time with them! They are clear and concise. Their properties have great unique charm, not cookie cutter at all. Would recommend living with them.",

        "review": "I parked in the Herald building parking lot legally to visit one of the tenants of the Herald building but was given a huge sticker on my window which I cannot remove. better signage is much needed to explain the required sign in procedure in the lobby of the Herald building.",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "This is an unfortunate incident that occurs from time to time.  Our lot currently has 15 designated visitor parking spaces.  Our \"Herald Building Parking ONLY signage\" is located at the entrance of the parking lot where the visitor parking row is located: \n \n\"FOR VISITORS AND PERMIT PARKING.  ALL VISITORS (2 HOURS MAX) MUST SIGN IN AT THE HERALD BUILDING LOBBY.  VISITORS TO PARK IN \"VISITOR\" DESIGNATED SPACES ONLY.  UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNERS'S RISK & EXPENSE.\" \n \nThis lot is designated for Herald Building Tenants with a valid parking permit and their visitors.  If a vehicle does not display a permit, or has not properly parked in a stall marked \"visitor\" AND signed in as instructed there is no way for us to determine if the vehicle belongs to a guest, a client of the Herald Building, or a visitor to the neighboring businesses."

They prepared our space beautifully before move in, have worked tirelessly to fix any issues after move in, and their staff is great, from the maintenance crew to the cleaning crew, to Jena in the main office. They are great people and I have been nothing but pleased with my experience working in a Daylight building.",

        "review": "After I moved in, I realized there were little things that I'd prefer to modify.  I wanted my bedroom door changed, I wanted some of the paint colors in my living room and kitchen swapped, and I wanted my refrigerator door mounted to open on the opposite side.  Some of these seemed kind of minor and made me feel like I was just being picky.  So, honestly, I really wasn't sure what to expect or if this would be taken seriously.  Boy was I surprised.  Jena, the Leasing Manager, immediately noted my requests and made me feel like they were well received.  Then she had a maintenance technician, Keith, contact me the very next business day!  Keith met with me within 48 hours of that!  He was great.  We walked through my apartment, looked at all of my requests, and came up with a plan to address all of them.  Every single one!!!  He was so easy to work with and was very personable and responsive to everything I had listed.  He didn't, for a single minute, make me feel like I was just being picky, even though I had thought I was.  The whole experience was incredible and now I am living in a place that I've been able to make my own, with their help.  It's really encouraging knowing what a great team there is supporting me.  If I could give them more than 5 Stars, I would.",

        "review": "If I could give this company a negative \"10 stars\", I would.  I responded to an ad on Craigslist for office space.  \"Hannah\", who apparently is in charge of showings, indicated that she had a 10:45am slot available for showing it to me.  I then called back and got her voicemail, confirming I would be there at the appointed time.  She then called me back to say \"Sorry, that time slot is taken and I don't have time until next week.\"  What?  Due to the fact that this was a small space, perfect for my needs and she was throwing up roadblocks to showing it to me and wouldn't lease it to me without showing it to me...but had no time to show it (a vicious, circular loop of highly unachievable conditions), I offered to give her a deposit right there and then.  But, that was refused.  She said she would show it to me this morning if it was still available, but that it \"would probably be leased by then.\"  I then called one of the principals, he listened, but then told me to call \"Hannah\" again.  Right! A big \"No Thanks!\" on that one!  So, this morning, she calls me to say she can show it to me, but she has a \"lease pending.\"  Pathetic!  If you want a run around and totally \"un-customer centric\" treatment, Daylight Properties is your place!",
