I rented from these guys 2014-2017; Joe tried to take my entire deposit plus double to replace all carpeting with no evidence of our doing or proof of age of the carpets. Took him to small claims and the judge laughed in his face. Mold everywhere too btw, and our water heater flooded the garage took days for them to come out. Im surprised hes not yet learned his lesson. Sad they have a monopoly and that the city hasnt shut them down yet for illegal practices. Posting this warning for all the students: know your rights and dont skimp on taking these guys to court ;) Its worth your time and benefits not only yourself, but the community.",

        "review": "They put up \"for rent\" signs all over Bellingham on houses/properties that are NOT AVAILABLE FOR RENT or coming available for rent anytime soon just for marketing purposes. The renters are in long-term leases (not moving next month or anything). Very dangerous practice for their renters. Prospective renters obviously think the property is available or they think the renter in the home is the homeowner, so they knock on the door to ask questions about the house or walk the property and look in windows. Just a matter of time before they are sued.",

        "review": "Future college students looking to rent from Hammer: Beware! I lived in a house \"managed\" by Hammer properties for 2 years 2018-2020. Joe was our landlord. Throughout my experience they proved to be exploitive and unresponsive, preying on college students who neither have the money nor means to stand up to this property management. They didn't respond to several of our maintenance requests, even when our roof was leaking into our house! And the few times maintenance was done, there was no prior notice and contractors came UNANNOUNCED! They took over a $1,000 of our security deposit, stating that they had hired a cleaning service for 12 + hours?!?! even though we had already cleaned and left the place in great shape! Mold and mildew tests that proved to be at dangerous levels were shrugged off by Joe the landlord and he said if it bothered us we could move. Not to mention, the vast majority of WWU college students that have rented from Hammer will tell you a similar story. Scroll through the other reviews and decide for yourself, but these property management company is criminal.",

        "review": "Hammer Properties provides excellent housing near to WWU campus. Mike, the owner, was always pleasant and prompt. I lived in my apartment for 2 years and have no complaints. My emotional animal is a 60lb pit bull mix; if your animal is truly serviced or needed for emotional support, you will have no issues. My partner and I made sure the house was clean and in good condition before we moved out and were happy to receive our entire deposit back in full. I think this property management may unfairly get a bad reputation because majority of properties are rented out to college students whom may not have a lot of patience when it comes to issues being resolved. So long as you are able to communicate your needs and be a decent human being, you will enjoy Hammer Properties.",

I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Hammer is the best I've worked with. My experience with them has been positive overall, and I don't feel they have ever been unreasonable with me.\n\nWe recently got a new kitchen faucet and washing machine when our old ones stopped working. Maintenance crew deserves a shout out for being great as well.\n\nOverall, if you pay your rent, and don't cause issues, Hammer is a great rental agency to work with.",

        "review": "I understand that all rental companies have their downsides, but Hammer really nailed it when they hired Lisa Meagher. She is by FAR the best property manager I have ever had and I've had a lot of them. She was kind, patient, responsive and professional. The space we moved into was really clean and we stayed there for 2 years. Anytime there were maintenance requests, we had people at the place in a day. I'm gonna say her name again: Lisa Meagher. If you rent through Hammer and you have Lisa as your property manager, you are in very good hands.\nWhen we moved out, we were conned into a terrible and falsely advertised house from Lakeway Rental. We had finally got our money back and had to search for a new place quickly. Lisa would immediately respond to companies for all of our rental verifications/applications and was incredibly patient as we tried to find a new home.\nI can't recommend her enough\nThanks Lisa",

I cant personally verify this because Ive ended up fixing everything myself or ignoring it, but I have it on good authority that they take maintenance costs out of your security deposit (illegal)\n\nSo non-communicative its almost impressive, if my job were to sit at a desk and answer emails and phone calls all day I would be embarrassed to be so absent.\n\nIf at all possible DO NOT rent a hammer property.",

The place looked like a crack house (for lack of a better term) They made us pay for the carpets to be cleaned before moving in and after seeing the state of things we cleaned the carpets ourselves and the water was literally black. On multiple occasions we caught the landlord looking in our windows. They cut off a lock on the basement door that we put on for safety without telling us defacing our property. After leaving the place better than we left it (gum off floors, new light fixtures, and clean carpets all with our own money) they still had the audacity to take a third of our security deposit without giving us a reason as to why they took our money.

They have a few decent landlords like Joe and Lisa, but the owner and the company as a whole are awful. Sadly, there's not many options for north campus living since they hold the majority of the properties, but avoid them if you can.",

        "review": "My son, a student at WWU, rented his first apartment this fall from Lisa Meagher at Hammer Properties. Communication with Lisa before move in was great - very responsive and professional to all our many questions. The terms of the lease were fair and straightforward. Move in went smoothly - the apartment was ready on time, it was clean and many updates had been made which was a pleasant surprise. Paying rent was easy and the utilities, which were split between all the apartments in the house was fair. Lisa went the extra mile when my son decided to transfer from WWU and sublet his apartment. Since his leave was unexpected and we live out of state it was a bit tricky for us to clean and show the apartment, and So Lisa graciously helped us get a tenant and transfer the lease. She was responsive to my emails and helped smooth out some bumps with the prospective tenant.\nAfter reading so many negative reviews, I was reluctant to rent with Hammer, but we had a great experience and I  could not have asked for a better property manager!",

Mold/Mildew in the windows, terryaki stains on the blinds, all the cabinets and cupboards were sticky with some residue, stains and weed marks all over the place, graffiti on doors, on and on. We spent quite a few hours cleaning the place and made sure to document it on move in form. We were told as long as we documented it, we would have no problems getting our refund back BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT HAMMER! We got charged a large portion of our deposit when moving out and they said we didn't really document that it was dirty.

        "review": "We just had an exasperating experience with a realtor from Hammer NW named Joe Tedrow. He was representing a couple of buyers who made an offer on our property. We countered with a higher offer and they accepted quickly. Then we passed the septic inspection and Joe took a drinking water sample, which he bungled. Our realtor took another sample which we passed. Okay, so on to the house inspection right? Nope. This idiot then tries to run us through the ringer on whether the buyers can get Comcast or not. This was not part of the original agreement by the way. We have wireless and it is fast enough for us. Why we are supposed to agree on an add-on is beyond me. Joe finally said we had to agree to a \"feasability study\" or they would back out of the deal. So we said, \"Okay, you're done.\" It should be obvious that: 1) the buyers just wanted out of the deal or 2) Joe was trying to scam us into lowering our price. At any rate, this was not ethical behavior. Shame on you, Joe!\n\nNow our farm is back on the market and the potential buyers  missed out on a nice property. We don't have a rigid timeline so we can afford to wait and the real estate market in Whatcom County is still going up. So for those of you contemplating doing business with Hammer NW, my advice is to look elsewhere.",
