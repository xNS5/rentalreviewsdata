        "review": "These apartments get the job done, and while you aren't getting high quality, the prices are good for this area. When I moved into my unit last year, my unit contained fleas, which the property management company appeared to have known about. While the situation was handled promptly, it was an unpleasant experience for me, and irresponsible on their part to not inform me. Additionally, the carpets in my unit were absolutely atrocious looking, with numerous stains. The laundry machines are coin operated and do not work well, requiring several drying cycles before your clothes will actually dry. Some pros of this unit are that the one bedrooms pretty good in size, with it's best features probably being the balconey and it's convinient location to WWU. It's located right in front of a bus lines that goes up to WWU, and it's a month to month lease after six months. As a graduate student in a budget, I felt that these apartments served their purpose well. However, I would advise renters to just be aware of some of the issues I mentioned above too.",

This complex has ruined the experience Bellingham had to offer due to the unprofessional staff who chose to not abide by the RCW codes they so rudely told me to \"look up.\" On one hand they're billing me after sending emails stating the property is in my possesion while simultaneously entering the premise without a 30-day notice to remove personal property and change the locks. They also will not inform you of their policies unless at their discretion and do not allow complaints/grievances. I would not trust this establishment.",
