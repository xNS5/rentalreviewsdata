        "review": "Let's just start out if I could give The Rent Lady a 0 star I would. Robin is a horrible property manager. She has not fixed a single thing she was supposed to when moving in. It took 7 months for her to come and fix our deck. And she told me to get some. Nails and a hammer and fix the lower one myself. She doesn't answer her phone and always claims she is too busy. When dropping rent off to her house her housemate was smoking weed in her office. Her professionals who came to fix my deck that was leaking. Used our trash and painted over dirt and leaves before washing it down. It's been two days and the paint is already peeling! She has yet to fix our fireplace, the house was dirty when we moved in...she told us we could clean it ourselves. She shows up unannounced and walks into your backyard without notice! I absolutely would not recommend her. You have to call her at least 6 times before she answers. \n\n\nShe also says that propane is a unspoken rule although it isn't on our lease. \n\n\nHmmmm... I thought leases were straight forward.",

I pay cash early ever month for the rent and we have had no problems getting anything fixed that needed fixed. We hope to continue working with Robin as our landlord for a long time to come",

All questions have been responded to quickly and everything has been handled with the utmost professionalism. If you are looking to rent a property under their care I would highly recommend them.",

        "review": "If I could I would give her no stars... Robin (Owner) was in charge of looking after our house. After the tenants moved out with out 20 day notice that was stated they had to give in the contract. They had done some damages to our house. Robin repeatedly denied that the tenants did the damages. She gave them back the whole deposit. So, when I came up to inspect the house and do some work to it. There was a bunch of damage that wasn't listed on there walk thru list. I asked her about it and she kept denying that the last tenants did this damage. Well she brought over some pictures of the house before they moved in. Well, those pictures proofed her wrong. There was no damages shown in the pictures that she said the previous tenant did. Now were out a thousand dollars because she didn't do her job correctly. Her job that she kept telling me that she was too busy for.... She has yet to contact us about reimbursing us for the damages.",
