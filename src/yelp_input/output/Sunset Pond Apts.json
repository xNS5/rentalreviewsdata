      "review": "Not a safe place to live. Outside: trash everywhere, homeless people, car windows bashed in, property stolen off porch. Inside: overflowing toilets, standing water inside that management not only won't care about but would then probably charge you for water damage upon move out. \n\nI was forced to pay other peoples bills when I lived here or threatened with eviction. I was never compensated for their mistake, just treated with hostility. \nI was also forced to pay for the carpets to be replaced when I moved out based on how the carpets looked on the bottom once ripped out, not the top that you can see. They did not let me see the state the bottom of the carpet upon move in yet that's what they judged it off of upon move out... they really just make their own rules here and will continue to take advantage of people\n\nDon't risk it! Live anywhere else.",

      "review": "Avoid this place at all costs especially if you are a single woman! \nWe had issues on several occasions with the cleaner harassing and peering in windows, taking pictures, when many other units were far worse than my daughter's . Piles of trash all over balconies, throwing trash over the edge, screaming and yelling from other units. People park huge vehicles in compact spaces and others have to crawl in and out of cars. The office is always closed and the staff mean and rude.\n\nMy daughter was also harassed by homeless people and we called the police on several occasions. The police said the landlords were responsible to keep homeless people off of peoples patios and that motion lights/cameras should be installed. When I contacted the management they said it wasn't their problem.\n\nMy daughter has been targeted by rude bitter people who excuse the behavior of some and harass others.",

      "review": "We had a 2nd floor apartment with a stunning view of the pond. Our apartment came with a discount and even though we had our rent raise it was still a very good price compared to those in town. The front office people were always kind to us, the maintenance here are hard workers and treat you with kindness. Overall we enjoyed our experience here.",

      "review": "My wife lived there for a year (2017-2018), and I visited regularly. \n\nPros: \n-The area is clean and well taken care. \n-Contrary to the past the neighborhood is pretty safe. \n- In unit laundry \n-It's a walking distance to several shopping places in Sunset square \n- Adequate quest parking space \n- Most tenants were decent and respectful \n\nCons: \n- Parking is pretty tight especially if you have a mid to large size car. \n- Office staff, especially the old lady that works there was remarkably rude and condescending on many occasions when I visited the office\n- Our upper floor was unusually squeaky anytime someone walked up there to the point that it wakes you up if you're sleeping \n- It would take maintenance staff several days to come over and fix something simple",

      "review": "Apartment has great view of the pond- Third floor, great window and balcony. We moved into the maintenance manager's old place so everything was in working order, cheap carpeting and plastic shower inserts, but very livable. We cleaned when me moved in. Parking spaces are very small and cars will be dinged by doors. I did also hear of a few neighbors cars being stollen.\n \nBeware of move out fees! We moved out and cleaned, but it was an off time when we were leaving so the apartment manager did not check us out. They charged us 5 hours of cleaning to a total of $159.87. Fine, whatever, I have always walked through before and if anything was not up to par, I would re-clean, but it was cleaner than when we moved in. We had steam cleaned the carpet, oven was clean, bathrooms spotless, balcony wiped down (moss & mold-less). We paid the bill, check cleared, no problem. Then a month later, we have collections trying to recollect this. \n\nThe office simply does not have their stuff together. Incorrectly sending a paid bill to collections should have some reprocussions, but it simply doesn't. \n\nRead more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/WA/Bellingham/Sunset-Pond-Apartments_360734772298226/review-111205729#ixzz2jh5WuC2P",

      "review": "Overall this place is very livable.  The area has been quiet, clean and I have appreciated the friendly neighbors.  The club is great!  A place to get away after a long day and get a quick workout in or soak in the hot tub.  The main complaint is the tight parking spaces and a lack of them for guests.",

      "review": "This was my second time living in these apartments while in my hometown and I have nothing but love for the managers and staff at this complex. Karl and Jeeter always are prompt, efficient and friendly. They helped me out more times than I can count. They kept the apartments, community rooms and parking lots looking clean and presentable. \n\nThe only reasons why the apartments themselves do not rate 5 stars in my book was the noise from the neighbors beside me penetrated through my walls, and the townhouse parking, although covered, was further away from my unit, so my children and i often got wet before getting to our car. That's Bellingham for ya, not that we mind to much.\n\nI highly recommend this complex and if my husband and I don't end up purchasing a house, we'll more than likely reside there again.",
