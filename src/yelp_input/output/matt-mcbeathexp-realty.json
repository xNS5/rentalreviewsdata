        "review": "I selected Matt McBeath (of ReMax's Bellingham office) as my real estate agent when we decided to sell our custom home. I selected Matt because he is highly regarded by other buyers and sellers from the Bellingham area. He is knowledgeable and hardworking. What sets Matt McBeath apart from other real estate agents is his ability to identify similar homes sold  in the area and settle on an asking price that is \"just right\". The text he wrote to describe my home and its setting attracted serious buyers. I was very impressed that he hired a skilled photographer who, in addition, utilized a drone to capture the unique setting of my home.\nThroughout the process he provided me with frequent feedback. Matt McBeath is an exceptional real estate broker.",

        "review": "My husband and I were entertaining the idea of moving away from Seattle and were casually looking to relocate further towards the border as the majority of our family lives in Canada.   Through chance we were matched with Matt who was responsive, respectful, and professional in his communication throughout our uncertainty.  \n\nHe guided us throughout the process of buying a home, recommended professionals in the area from mortgage brokers, lenders to inspectors who are experts in their field.  \n\nCircumstances kept us from moving up north.  Matt was understanding and supportive.  I would recommend him to anyone who would like to work with a seasoned knowledgeable professional who is truly a buyers agent.  \n\nHe will never pressure you to buy a home you have reservations about.  He will listen to your needs and try to match our aesthetic as much as possible.  He will make you feel like a priority because you are. \n\nEven after notifying him that we would have to stay closer to an area he did not service, he was more than happy to offer any assistance he could.  I don't think that just makes him a great realtor and professional, I think it also makes him a great human being.  \n\nMatt McBeath really is Woohoo! As good as it gets!",
