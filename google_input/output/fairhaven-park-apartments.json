        "review": "It's only been a few months, but so far it's been great. Management has been helpful, as well as maintenance. The location is perfect with many trails leading out from the property. Rent is a bit high, but to me it's worth it, just the location alone. The complex overall is pretty quiet too, which is a bonus.\nUpdate: it's been two years now and I'm very satisfied with this management company, they are extremely responsive with maintenance issues and keep up the grounds on a regular basis. I may be here a while.",

        "review": "Do not rent a unit from Fairhaven Park Apts.  The buildings have serious leaks that are left unfixed for years and no insulation in the walls.....this has led to horrible horrible mold-multiple and aggressive types.  My furniture and clothing was ruined in under 3 months.  My pets both had a mysterious fungal infection that developed within the 3 months.  My neighbors have a major leak that's been left unrepaired for a year and they still rent units to new tenants knowing the building is not livable.  They don't give a damn about putting people in dangerously toxic units and will lie to you without any hesitation.  They will be nice until you move in.  STAY AWAY and don't trust Megan or Jennifer or anyone in maintenance.",

        "review": "This used to be a nice place to live. Then around 2009 or so things started going downhill. Since then they try to jack up your rent to the max every year. On top of the rent increases they find other sneaky ways to squeeze more and more money out of you. The way they treat long time tenants is truly despicable.",

        "review": "Just had management come to my door informing me that I could not smoke outside on my private patio... My reaction was okay wont happen but I was misinformed and your policy does not specify that but instead states it is a smoke free community. I then tell them that that is misleading and that they need to change the policy to specify what that means.  The response I got was ... \" Oh move somewhere else then.\" I have not caused any problems nor do I feel I broke any rule seeing how they failed to have this in their policies.  That level of disrespect and rudeness is horrid and no one deserves to be treated like that.",
