        "review": "It doesnt even deserve the one star. We were robbed in multiple ways including, by a intruder, of our deposit, paying more due to fabricated lies of how we kept the condition of the place, management is not approachable and non supportive. After having a truder enter our apartment, we were verbally told that we could purchase security devices that would be reimbursed. Management refused to pay and stated she did not agree to that statement. Also, kept and left the space very clean to have lies stated of the condition the space was left in. Also, have to pay more than double the deposit. Very disappointed and definitely not recommend!",

        "review": "I rented this gorgeous 3 bedroom 2 bathroom SPACIOUS unit here sight unseen. Admittedly I was extremely nervous to see it having had bad experiences in the past. I've been here 1 week and my jaw keeps hitting the floor with how amazing this place is and how kind and helpful the staff are. My first day here, the dryer wasn't working properly and maintenance showed up within the hour! Kasha at the front desk is warm and friendly, and she is the reason everything went so smoothly for us. She is an advanced problem solver and I feel very lucky to be here with my two kids.",

        "review": "I moved into sunset pond apartments at the end of March 2023. The application process was smooth and predictable thanks to Kasha, the office manager. Kasha is professional and kind. She made the acceptance criteria clear and was certain to reach out promptly if more information was required for approval. After approval I was given a move in date. Maintenance efficiently turned my unit and I moved in on schedule. Maintenance clearly takes pride in their work and it was obvious that they paid attention to the details while turning my unit. The cleaner also left my unit spotless.\n\nDo your research on the area so you understand and are comfortable in your new neighborhood. Overall I am completely satisfied with Sunset Pond Apartments, excited to live here, enjoy the amazing amenities, and pleased to work with Sunset Pond staff!",

Apartments are nice and maintenance always comes and does the work orders in a timely manner. There is some homeless you will see but they are pretty harmless. I really enjoyed living here and will miss it!",

        "review": "The apartment: Very large 2 bedroom with huge walk in closet, open concept living room/kitchen, nice locking storage off the patio, nice vinyl double pane windows and sliders lets in plenty of daylight, stack washer dryer too!. For the rent amount, you can't get better square footage.  The property: Free assigned, covered parking, large indoor pool, hot tub and sauna, nice workout room , pool table in clubhouse and yes, you can reserve the clubhouse for a party or gathering! Water, sewer and garbage is paid which is excellent! Walk-ability: Within walking to stores, movie theatre, restaurants, etc... On Site manager and Staff:  Kasha is a highly trained professional manager who happens to live on site.  This is getting rare as most apartment management companies are faceless and have no real vested interest in their home.  This is her home and she continually makes property improvements. The maint. staff are friendly and prompt. The housekeeper/groundskeeper does an excellent job as well.  We're moving to a warmer climate but I would recommend Sunset Pond Apartments.",

        "review": "Not a safe place to live, only has residents due to there not being many options elsewhere. Loud neighbors who threw toys and trash onto our patio. Didn't seem to be any consequences because of how often it happened. Loud all the time, had my car broken into, and bike stolen here. Parking sometimes wasn't guaranteed because cars had been abandoned there for months. Paying rent in out dated inconvenient ways, with only check or money order. Better off anywhere I promise you. 2 stars because you can sign a month to month lease, letting you move out as soon as you can.",

        "review": "I am a current tenant here and have nothing but good thing to say about the manager Kasha and maintenance team! They are all very good at what they do. The manager is very professional and make sure she keeps the property is in good condition. She does everything in her power to take care of the homeless situation. Some of the reviewes are not fair she does all that she can when dealing with homless. I have lived here several years and plan on being here for several more. Keep up the good work Kasha!  You do a good job at doing your job.\n\nhave nothing but",
