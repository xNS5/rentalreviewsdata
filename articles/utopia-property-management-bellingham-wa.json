        "review": "Please please please do NOT rent any property that utopia management manages or owns!!! I cannot urge enough that they will time and time again let you down-\nI rented one of their properties in Bellingham this past year and they had bought the property out from Chuckanut Properties on September 1st. When we moved in, though this is on Chuckanut technically, the washer/dryer did not function and neither did the dishwasher. For approximately six months after our move in, we constantly put in work orders, called the office and tried to go in person about our broken dishwasher. We were ignored, told that our property had been looked at by maintenance (it hadnt) and had our work orders closed time and time again. Not to mention that the only time we COULD get someone to look at it was an unrelated repairman they sent out for something small and entirely different only because we asked him in person to do so and he did out of kindness. It was only in March/April that our dishwasher was FINALLY repaired magically after they delayed a city inspector from coming to look at the house so they would pass their inspection. They do not care about their tenants- they care about meeting the legal minimums that they are required to meet and even those they barely manage to meet. Then, as a cherry on top, during move out, they charged one of our roommates an extra months rent through auto pay and tried to deny it happening. As the fairytale ending to this story, they sent us our deposit finally; barely making the 30 day post marking law; and after depositing the check told us they were having it sent back to them because we all (five roommates living all over the country) are required to sign it, and maybe we shouldve known that we had to do it that way with no proper instruction. We were then advised that we should mail the check around the country to get it signed, meanwhile one of our roommates is left for days with -$2000 in her bank account as she had already transferred the funds to our other roommates and has no instant transfer service to get it back into her account before they bounce the check. When i called, i was told to mail the check around the country to get it signed and that this is just the law they have to follow. when I requested the laws that they were citing? they told me they cannot give me the laws and would send an instruction sheet how to deposit it. why this instruction sheet was not sent with the check originally is BEYOND me. do not rent from utopia unless you want management who does not care about you, will take half your deposit for normal wear and tear and will only follow the laws to the minimum they must. just my two cents. (ive also attached photos that were the state of the property when we moved in, again, chuckanut was responsible at that time but now utopia is the one charging us half our deposit to fix up a house that was like this when we arrived.)",

I hope you do better for your other tenants. The only reason I'm not rating 1 star is because the utopia handymen are fantastic and service requests were handled promptly.",

        "review": "I rented a very old apartment from Utopia Management. (Briarwood building downtown) Lived in it for two years and I honestly dont have anything good to say.. Granted it was one of the cheapest places to rent in the area but it was wildly overpriced for the state of the apartment. Winters were painfully cold, the heater was a super old radiator that would bang loudly 24/7. Even when it wasnt turned on.. So miserable to never get to sleep peacefully. Its pretty obvious that they just repaint with each new tenant, the floors get scuffed super easy and you can see the many many layers of paint buildup. Even on the tiny counter in the tiny kitchen, just repainted.. The landlord special! Also I got charged for a cleaning fee once I moved out, which Im sure they do to every tenant. I can say with confidence it doesnt get cleaned properly because there was filth buildup all over the place when we moved in.. Near the end of our tenancy, an employee of utopia management pulled some bs trying to enter our apartment with absolutely zero notice. Luckily they didnt have a spare key or they would have entered to tour with us chilling in our underwear. Just bad management all around. Do not recommend.",

After adjusting it to fit in the frame, it turned out perfect! No more drafts and no more putting paper towels in the door jam and towels on the bottom! \n\nJamey also came and replaced the pipes that led to my outside faucet and wrapped them for winter and replaced my water heater!\n\nI can't say enough good about how fast and efficient Jamey is! He's very friendly and professional!! I'm so happy with his work! After dealing with Chuckanut Property Management since 2011, Utopia Management is a breath of fresh air! The people at Chuckanut didn't care, didn't communicate hardly at all, and did very poor work when they finally came for maintenance project. Jamey has proven that good maintenance men do exis!! Thank you Jamey! You are very valuable!!\n\nBrenda Brown\nFerndale, WA",

        "review": "I have been a tenant with four property management companies in Bellingham, plus a private landlord, and my experience with Utopia has been by far the worst. \n\nI was renting a large house with seven other tenants--and we originally signed a lease with Chuckanut Property Management, which was bought up by Utopia soon after. After taking over, Utopia informed us there was a large balance owed on our account, despite all of us tenants having records of paying the first and last month's rent upon move-in as required. The discrepancy may have been due to shoddy record keeping on Chuckanut's part, but folks at Utopia never showed any real interest in figuring out what happened. They just kept insisting we pay the balance, which we eventually did since they were charging us late fees and it was pretty clear they weren't going to be responsive. \n\nI even went into their office in person once to ask for information about the balance discrepancy. I was given a hard-to-decipher record of financial transactions which didn't appear to show where the missing balance came from at all, and was essentially told they didn't have time talk to me about it. After that I exchanged a couple of short emails with Shayli, who said she would look into the situation, but ultimately no one followed up in any meaningful way and they never provided us with an explanation of where the mystery balance came from.\n\nFast forward to when it was time to move out, and we learned Utopia was asking us to pay last month's rent, which we'd already paid when we moved in. When we first contacted them about this, they insisted they were in the right. After quite a few back-and-forth emails and text messages, they finally admitted they were wrong and cancelled the balance. However, their apparent failure to get a handle on their own financial records left an impression of huge incompetence.\n\nFinally, after move-out I reached out to Utopia about getting our deposits back. For context: at move-in, each of the eight people in the house was asked to provide a separate payment for their portion of the deposit. However, I was informed that to return our deposit, Utopia will write a single check addressed to all of us--making it practically impossible for us to deposit the check unless we can all go into a bank at the same time (we've all gone separate ways after moving out and I don't think everyone even lives in Bellingham anymore). I asked repeatedly that they send me my portion of the deposit as a single check addressed to me, and they flat-out refused. It is beyond me to understand why it's apparently so impossible for them to simply write out eight checks instead of one. Their refusal to do so means we may never be able to get our deposits back, which of course works out well for them.\n\nThe person at Utopia who is apparently responsible for our deposits is Dan Zedonek, who replied to my repeated emails with a brief message saying I \"must not be up to speed on landlord tenant law,\" and to look for the check (addressed to all eight of us) in the mail. In other words, once again, Utopia has blown off our concerns and given no indication that they really care about ensuring tenants' money is returned to them. All I can say is if you work with Utopia, you'll have to hold them accountable at every step because they'll squeeze extra money from you however they can.",

        "review": "Will take several weeks to respond to emails and/or ignore you altogether. Incompetent communication at best, although I'm beginning to realize possible careless or malicious intentions. Our house has been getting repeatedly vandalized and Utopia has pointed the finger at us, their justification being that it's \"concerning\" that it started happened after we moved in. Keep in mind that I've never had this problem before. I've put incredible effort into explaining to them why vandalism against a property is the homeowner's responsibility, to which I was told that we are responsible for \"damage\" (all damage - really?) and to let them know if I wanted to move out and then silence. I can't remember an instance of a disagreement being handled so immaturely since I was in high school (and that was 10 years ago!). And this has mostly been our experience with them this year, e.g. ignored maintenance requests, ignored emails.\nI'd expect communication to be a top skill from a company who claims to \"manage\" things. Perhaps I'd be a lot more sympathetic toward poor communication from folks in a different profession, like a bus driver or a bongo street performer. But this has truly been an outright failure of basic job duties, which was disappointing and low-key embarrassing to witness. I've had better experiences with even Hammer and Landmark, which are words I never imagined I'd be saying. If you intend to stick up for your rights as a tenant, expect the silent treatment. YMMV",

We had asked you to clean the affected area, as vendors were unavailable at the time. The owners were sympathetic that this had happened and took proper steps with installing motion sensor lights to the exterior of the house. The second event in January did lead to concerns, as the property was previously occupied by the owners for many years. Neither the owners nor the HOA had records of previous vandalism in the area. \n\nYou had originally asked our office where to find in the lease that it states who's responsible for the clean-up of these events. Clear answers have been provided to you. We don't see any requests in our system that have not been addressed. Please reach out if you require assistance. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nShayli"

For instance, a user who has worked with Utopia to manage multiple properties expressed great satisfaction with their thoroughness and care for both properties and tenants. This sentiment was echoed by multiple reviewers who praised the consistent upkeep and attention given to properties managed by Utopia, showcasing their commitment to high standards in facilities management.</p><p>Moreover, Utopia has demonstrated a strong communication strategy when receiving positive feedback, as reflected in their prompt responses to user reviews expressing gratitude for their services.

A user described frustrating experiences with unresponsive support when dealing with malfunctioning appliances, stating that numerous work orders were ignored for months. This lack of timely service negatively impacted their living situation, leading to a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the management's commitment to addressing tenant needs.</p><p>Another area of concern is the execution of management transitions, with one tenant reporting confusion and a lack of contact when the company took over their building. This transition left many feeling uncertain and apprehensive, as they received no prior notifications, reflecting poorly on the company's professionalism. Although the handymen received praise for their work, the overall communication and transition practices left something to be desired, indicating a need for improvement in these areas.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pThe most alarming experiences shared by users highlight severe deficiencies in how Utopia manages tenant disputes and issues. One tenant detailed a nightmare scenario where not only were they encouraged to pay a rent balance they did not owe, but they also faced burdensome conditions for returning their security deposit. After a long battle over financial discrepancies, they ultimately faced complications in retrieving their funds, highlighting a significant gap in transparency and customer care.</p><p>Additionally, multiple users noted a troubling pattern of poor communication, with some stating that their emails went unanswered for weeks or were outright ignored. This lack of response, coupled with feelings of being blamed for issues such as vandalism on the property, led tenants to feel unsupported and dismissed by the management. These experiences paint a troubling image of Utopia Property Management for potential renters, signaling the importance of thorough due diligence before working with them.</p></section>"
