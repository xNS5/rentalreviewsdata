        "review": "Worst property management company. We left the place we rented spotless and they withheld upwards of $500 from us. We were only in the place one year and were assigned a new property manager halfway through the year who never saw the property. I asked for an itemized list of what the costs were and they would not provide. Aside from their unprofessional manner they handled the situation, there was never a walkthrough done with us before or after we left. Would definitely not recommend as I believe we were cheated out of hundreds of dollars.",

        "review": "Be careful if you rent a property through Optimus. They charged us $315 of our security deposit for \"general cleaning\" despite that we left the property spotless. The lease allowed cleaning only if we left the property dirty and we provided an extensive number of photos proving the property did not need cleaning (we spent hours scrubbing the house and leaving it clean). We asked them what needed to be cleaned by them and they were unable to answer that and said that since the cleaners were already paid there is no way to refund us. I would not rent through them again given what feels like a deceptive and dishonest business practice.",

        "review": "House was supposedly being actively managed by Optimus (Suzzanne Medina). Took the house back after several years as a rental and found several problems that had never been mentioned.  Some examples:\n\n1. No pets allowed: Renters obviously had a cat that severely urinated in several rooms. Had to rip out all flooring, baseboards, curtains.  The intensity (after cleaning) indicates it had been going on for a while.  \nObviously no one monitors the property well enough to know what's going on with the property.  \nCleaning had been done by Optimus but the stench was still overwhelming and NO mention was ever made of this problem.\n\n2. Inside door to the garage had been kicked in at some point as the frame was split, door cracked around the latch, latch plate area destroyed and plate gone.  The quality of the repair was apparently someone just driving two nails into the frame to try to hold the splintered wood together.\n\n3. Myriad of smaller poorly done repairs and ignored broken items NONE of which had ever been detailed to us.  \n*Microwave door had been damaged so it wouldn't latch.  I guess you can use it by standing there and holding the door shut with your hand while it runs.  \n*Toilet handle/lever was wrong.  Its on an angled part of the tank and the wrong handle with a straight arm was used so the arm scrapped the inside of the tank.  It bound up when flushed so the handle never pops back.  After the renters moved out the toilet had been running for a solid month in the midst of local water restrictions.\n*Outside outlet box had come loose due to damaged wooden plate and was hanging out of the wall.\n*Furnace had not been inspected in over 4 years per maintenance label.\n*Mold (light but still mold) growing in the master bath shower upper wall/ceiling.\n*Bottom of a kitchen cabinet drawer was separated from the back and was coming apart.\n\nYou get the picture.  Choose wisely if you actually want a management company that actively looks out for the property.",

As I have 44 years of apartment operating experience I am used to disgruntled tenant voices. It's just what happens even if the property is managed well.\n At our property Suzzanne has aided in roof and gutter cleaning, complete repair of the building drainage system, a parking lot reseal and restripe, deck repair and painting, a complete hallway painting including colorful doors and new base trim, new hallway carpet, heater repairs, broken window seal repairs, numerous flooring jobs, a re-cert of the fire alarm system, replacing a tub/shower enclosure and catching up to 2+ years of deferred maintenance. Vacancies have been promptly filled. A job well done and that's just the first 6 months!",

        "review": "Do NOT use this rental company. Suzanne, the lady I worked with was very slow at getting repairs done for the year I rented through them. I had to fully clean the place before I moved in, removing drug paraphernalia and painting the WHOLE condominium myself. Upon move out, she preceded to charge me for things such as putting closet doors back on track and an OLD shower head!!! This place was a dump when I moved in and I left it 1000x better upon move out. She doesn't \"do,\" a move out walk through with you and conveniently LOST my move in check list. What a horrible experience this was. Although, I did learn a lot about renting through this rental company, and am highly motivated to buy now......I still feel sick to my stomachache.",

        "review": "As a tenant I recently vacated a residence being managed by this company. I must advised they are poor communicators, with no response or calls returned. I dealt with Julia who failed to communicate that my security deposit had been returned to me on a specific date. What I received was \"your security deposit was returned a copy of days ago.\" however they never asked for an address to send the deposit. In addition, when asked where it was sent, the response was \"the last known address\". Again, what did they consider the last known address?? I called to inquire when email was not returned but was unable to speak with Julia, she was supposedly in a meeting with the owners??  I left a voicemail. Shortly after received an email that indicated that it had been sent to the address which I had just vacated.  Does that really make sense, or is this just a ploy to delay.  Would have been more professional to advise me of the date the deposit was sent,  as well as the address it was sent to. Unfortunately it was similar to what is referred to as pulling teeth to get a simply answer. \nI hope that you do not have to experience but I am guessing you will.",
