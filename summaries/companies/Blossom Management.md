Moreover, the process of returning security deposits is another common point of contention in the property management industry. Prospective tenants should ensure clarity on such procedures with Blossom Management beforehand to prevent any misunderstandings. Transparent communication regarding these aspects could vastly improve a tenant's experience and alleviate potential stress.

## Ugly

The "ugly" sides of property management experiences can severely impact a company's reputation. Poor communication, for instance, can lead to a breakdown in the relationship between the tenant and the management. While the single user review available for Blossom Management does not highlight any such extreme negatives, it is always wise for future clients to remain vigilant and seek out further reviews and testimonials to get a more comprehensive picture.
