I was living on the  east coast at the time and  extremely busy with work. During the process there were a few hiccups, but he was able to adjust on short notice in enough time to reschedule a closing date. I 100% recommend him to anyone on the market for a home.",

        "review": "Sean Ryan helped me buy my first home in 2013 and he's earned my repeat business since then in buying and selling, with my most recent purchase in 2021. From keeping me aware of market trends and helping me find a home that would work for my family and budget in a difficult market to helping me list and sell in a different season and market, Sean brought the right attention and energy to the task. He wrote almost 10 offers on my behalf during one home search and gave excellent advice regarding negotiating final terms. If you're looking for an agent that has experience and savvy, who will listen to your wants and needs and search on your behalf, Sean's your guy. If you're looking for an agent to market your home with excellent photos and help you decide the right listing price for the current market, Sean's your guy. I recommend his services wholeheartedly!",

He got over asking price even after going for the higher end listing. Sean is honest, easy to work with and would recommend him to anyone without hesitation.",

He just fell off the face of the earth. Never contacted me by phone, email, or text after our initial conversation about it. Needless to say, I found a new realtor.",

Was it a text message or email?"

        "review": "Sean Ryan and his team are truly second to none when it comes to any real estate needs! When my wife and I were shopping for our first house, we had a tough time finding an agent who really seemed to care about us and our vision. Through a referral we decided to give Sean a call. He was showing us houses by that afternoon and we were homeowners before we knew it. Within a few years we outgew the first house, and we had no doubt Sean was the guy to help us upgrade. He's never pushed us towards something we didn't want to do, but has always been informative. Sean kept our stress at a minimum and took care of everything needed in order to sell... Prep walk-through's, multiple market analysis, insight/advise on improvements, photos, list timing and whatever else that took place behind the scenes. Meanwhile he was also helping us find our 'next home'. In almost no time we accepted a buyers offer and had our own offer accepted on the future house. Today we are closing on both! It was absolutely a team effort, and that's one of the things we appreciate most about our agent! Not only are they experienced, trustworthy, reliable and personable, but the entire team has been there for us every step of the way. Sean goes above and beyond for us, but even the times when he's unavailable in a moment's notice, we never have to worry. Everyone contributed at critical times for us. We'd like to thank Lisa Tipton for her work behind the scenes and for being available to meet us at random hours. We'd like to thank Staci Ryan for being a HUGE part of getting our offer accepted. To the rest of the Ryan family for putting your night's on hold for our last minute inspections! And last but not least a special thank you to Sean Ryan for putting in all the work for us over time. We appreciate it! Five stars!",

        "review": "I wouldn't trust a real estate transaction to anyone but sean and his team. He has earned my trust and respect during the process of buying a new home and selling our old one.  If you want a real estate agent that will just do their part of the job, and then disappear you'll have to look somewhere else. Sean  communicates through the whole process making sure you are in the loop, follows up after the transaction, and truly cares about his clients. It's nice to have such a outstanding realtor to help make sure things go right.",

He listened to us, he provided a candid opinion when we were looking for one, he was able to negotiate us a great deal in this seller's market, and he made sure we didn't settle on the first house we were interested in. We are very grateful that he put in the extra effort and time to get us the best house for our money instead of just making a quick sale like he could have. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an honest not over the top pushy salesman. He was great to work with and had a wealth of knowledge about all aspects of the buying process.",

        "review": "My husband and I LOVED working with Sean.  We were able to get a great price for the house we were selling, even in this tricky market.  Sean always answered our questions, even when we asked them more than once.  (\"Have you heard anything?'  \"What have you heard?\"  \"Anything new since yesterday?)  He was a great sport and extremely helpful.  He devoted his time and energy (and at least one  entire Saturday) to helping us find our new home.\n\nIn the end, we found an amazing house, perfect for our family and in just the right neighborhood.  We are hoping that we will not be moving EVER again but if we do, we'll call Sean.",

        "review": "I never actually bought or sold a house through Sean, but I did ask him to research my house to see if it was a viable option to sell in a tough market. Sean was both honest and quick in his response. After working with him I feel that it is his stance to take the costumer's best interest in hand rather than his own. Instead of snowing us to gain another listing, Sean did the professional thing and told us to sit back and ride out the down trend. Who knows what would have happened (heck we can all strike gold once in a while), but I am much happier now still living in my beautiful home, knowing that someday the trend will reverse and the market will bare the true value what we have here. So, if integrity is an important quality for you in an agent, rest assured Sean is your man.",

        "review": "We all want to trust our real estate agent. Sean earned my trust in the purchase of my home in Bellingham. I was working with another local real estate agent for almost a year. My price point was in the competitive range, where multiple bids were driving the price up and creating bidding wars. Your realtor's reputation in his or her area makes a big difference in a sellers' market. All of my offers were falling short with my other realtor. This was happening so frequently I lost trust in her.  I called Sean and explained to him I would like to make an offer on a home. I told him about my prior experiences. He listened attentively and agreed to act as my real estate agent. To summarize: Sean completed the deal for thousands of dollars less than my offer or the asking price. Further, his attention to detail during escrow and after the sale, were above and beyond what I expected and I have purchased many pieces of real estate in my life. It is for this reason; I am recommending him with confidence. He has the experience and the charisma to close the deal for you with his unique trustworthy strategies.",
