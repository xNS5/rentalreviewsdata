        "review": "We had a HORRIBLE experience trying to rent a townhome with Dwell. First off the property was available immediately, but when I toured the place it was still very dirty and needed cleaning. In addition, there were a couple doors that had holes kicked in them that need replaced. Due to that and the fact that we needed to sublet our current apartment to move in, we set a move in date of 3 weeks later. With a move in date 3 weeks out, we expected prompt communication and updates on our application. There was a severe lack of communication from Tess and it felt like we had to call every day just to get updates on what they needed from us even though we promptly filled out our application. Less than two weeks out from the move in date, we finally called and said we needed to know that day and then suddenly, Tess emailed us saying we couldnt rent the place because we didnt carry a balance of 2.5x rent every month. No option to get a co-signer or anything. The lack of communication and follow-through could have left us homeless. My husband and I have over 10k in our bank accounts and we cant rent a $1800 townhome ",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Dwell Real Estate Asset Management has garnered numerous positive reviews from tenants who appreciate the responsiveness and professionalism of the management team. Many users have highlighted Kolton as an exemplary property manager who is not only knowledgeable but also friendly and available to assist whenever needed. For instance, multiple tenants mentioned that their experiences were smooth, with timely communication and support throughout the rental process, making moving in an enjoyable affair.</p><pIn addition to the exceptional customer service, tenants also commend Dwell for maintaining properties well and addressing minor maintenance issues promptly. Reviews reflect that the company is proactive in ensuring residents have a comfortable living experience, which is particularly beneficial for those renting new constructions or townhomes. Overall, the sentiment indicates that Dwell is committed to providing a high level of service that can greatly enhance the rental experience.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><pWhile most reviews are overwhelmingly positive, some tenants have expressed appreciation for Dwell\u2019s effort to resolve issues quickly and efficiently. For instance, certain renters have noted quick responses to minor problems they encountered shortly after moving in, contributing to an overall satisfactory living experience. These instances of good problem-solving reflect a strong dedication to tenant satisfaction that is crucial in property management.</p><pThe communication style of the management is frequently praised, with many past tenants highlighting that they felt well-informed about their applications and housing situations. The ability of Dwell to create a seamless leasing process is apparent, as several user reviews expressed gratitude for the scholarship of knowledge exhibited by the team. This accessibility and responsiveness are evident, further reaffirming Dwell's reputation as a reputable company in the property management sector.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><pOn the other side of the spectrum, Dwell has faced criticism regarding its application process and communication with potential tenants. A number of reviews pointed out frustrations with the property management's strict credit requirements, particularly for certain demographics like college students. These reviews indicate that the company has a rigid stance on co-signer agreements, which can alienate many prospective renters seeking housing opportunities.</p><pAdditionally, some users have reported discontent with the level of communication during the application process. One tenant shared their frustration after experiencing a lack of updates on their application status, leading to a challenging and anxiety-inducing situation. This inconsistency in communication can contribute to potential renters feeling neglected and may tarnish the overall impression of Dwell\u2019s operational efficacy.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pSeveral reviews have been strongly negative, emphasizing issues of perceived unprofessionalism in the application and renting stages. One user recounted their discouraging experience, noting that an initially available property was in poor condition upon viewing, with inadequate cleaning and maintenance prior to their scheduled move-in date. The dissatisfaction was exacerbated when this potential tenant was informed of restrictive rent-to-income ratios shortly before their move-in date, further indicating poor internal coordination and communication.</p><pMoreover, reviews that express sentiments about the overall management style describe Dwell as a company focused on profit rather than tenant satisfaction. Some past tenants have called Dwell a \"greedy\" property management firm, revealing a perception that the company prioritizes financial gain over providing quality housing solutions or maintaining good tenant relationships. Such reviews paint a troubling picture that could deter potential renters from considering Dwell for their leasing needs.</p></section>"
