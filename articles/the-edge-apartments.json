The cost to \"paint\" and \"clean\" (i.e., the things they don't have to itemize because it's labor) will be expensive. I lived there for 7 years and they didn't even replace the carpet after I moved out--it wasn't new when I moved in, either!",

The apartments and appliances are well taken care of, there is little parking, but it hasn't been a problem for me. There is available parking 1 block away. The staff and manager are always friendly and helpful.",

Youd think for how much they charge on rent it wouldnt be an issue for maintenance fixes but thats clearly not the case. The landlord has an attitude and is not prompt about updates or handling requests for maintenance. Rent through Son-Rise and dont waste your time or money living here.",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>    </header>    <p>This article is a summary generated by ChatGPT, intended solely to assist in the evaluation of The Edge Apartments by summarizing user reviews. Content herein reflects aggregated sentiments of the reviews without disclosure of reviewers' identities. Please note that this summary is not exhaustive and should be used as one of several tools for assessing property management companies or rental properties.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Good</h2>    </header>    <p>The Edge Apartments have garnered appreciation from some residents for their well-maintained condition and the responsiveness of the property management. According to user reviews, the appliances are in good order, and the staff, including the property manager, are described as friendly and helpful. These positive experiences, shared mostly by long-term residents, suggest that the company has the potential to provide a pleasant living environment.</p>    <p>Notably, instances of the property manager addressing problems promptly are highlighted as a consistent theme in positive reviews. The accessibility and assistance provided in various aspects of tenancy are commended and have led to high satisfaction for certain occupants. These experiences indicate that when attention is given, the management's performance meets or exceeds expectations.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Great</h2>    </header>    <p>Several users specifically praised the condition of the apartments and found The Edge to be the nicest place they\u2019ve lived in Bellingham. Longevity in residency, such as living on the property for multiple years, seems to contribute to residents' overall positive perceptions of the property. Moreover, regular maintenance and care seem to ensure the continuity of these impressions.</p>    <p>The aesthetics of the property also received positive remarks, suggesting that the apartments are well-presented and perhaps align with the contemporary expectations of style and functionality. This sense of pride in the property\u2019s appearance and maintenance can significantly contribute to the quality of life and satisfaction of the tenants.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Bad</h2>    </header>    <p>Although some reviews are favorable, there are recurring criticisms regarding The Edge Apartments' handling of parking facilities. Users express dissatisfaction with the scarcity of spots and the absence of visitor parking, which compounds the inconvenience. These parking issues appear to be a significant detractor from the living experience, as expressed by numerous residents.</p>    <p>Another point of contention lies in the execution of maintenance duties. Some reviewers noted that despite the high cost of rent, requesting maintenance fixes can be challenging due to slow response times and perceived inefficiency. Residents expect more proactive management, and these reported experiences have led to frustration and a sense that the company is neglecting its responsibilities.</p>  </section>  <section>    <header>      <h2>Ugly</h2>    </header>    <p>An aspect of the user reviews that is particularly disconcerting involves the return of security deposits. Residents have felt the need to meticulously document the state of their unit due to concerns over being overcharged for standard wear and tear. This indicates a trust deficit between residents and the property management, which can affect the overall reputation of the property.</p>    <p>The reviews also report issues with soundproofing, as some tenants experienced disruptions due to noise from neighboring units. These remarks suggest that privacy and peaceful enjoyment might be compromised for some residents. Additionally, the perceived lackluster attitude of the landlord in dealing with tenants' needs further exacerbates the impression of ineffective property management.</a>  </section></article>"
