        "review": "THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! DO NOT MOVE HERE I BEG YOU!\nThis place is an absolute nightmare, and was before we moved in, and continues to be.\nI couldn't scratch the surface of how bad this place was, but to give you context it was about $800 a month per person, and we lived there for about a year.\n\n-AWFUL communication from the multiple people who owned the property (I think there were 3 companies that owned in in less than a year). The emergency line (on multiple occasions) went unanswered, they just really don't care.\n\n-The apartments themselves SUCK. Not only are they small, but the design makes no sense. We had no living room/living space, and had no openable windows in the main area.\n\n-There is no upkeep to the property. This place is the definition of \"don't fix it, paint over it\". In the winter, there was a broken waterpipe that made accessing the parking lot dangerous -they didn't fix it for weeks.\n\n-No one who works there has any clue what they're doing (expect for Carl and Niko, who are awesome). Probably due to the management constantly changing, no one is ever able to give you a straight answer on anything -that is if you can even reach them. You call, you email, you can visit the office. Most of the time, they will not answer your calls (even if you leave a message), and are almost never at the office during office hours.\n\n-My roommates and I were tricked and lied to when it came to our lease. When we signed the lease, we were signing a lease for 5 bedrooms. AFTER we signed the lease, they told us no 5 bedroom apartments were available, so we ended up having to split up. We were totally tricked/trapped.\n\n-The security deposit was $200. After emailing and calling SEVERAL people, I finally got my deposit back about a month after moving out. When I got it, they had taken out $85 for maintenance and cleaning. WHAT?? Not only was the apartment FILTHY when we arrived, we also deep cleaned it before leaving. There was absolutely no damage, so there is no reason that money should've been taken out.\n\n-For weeks in the Winter, and Spring the fire alarms would go off for minutes at a time. Everyone would have to pack up themselves and their pets to move out into the parking -only for the fire department to tell us that there was no fire, but faulty equipment. THIS HAPPENED PROBABLY 10 TIMES ALTOGETHER.\n\n-Consistently bad wifi, no place to set up cable or internet in the main area\n\n-No circulation (food goes bad pretty fast)\n\n-Laundry cost $4 a load. The machines are disgusting and never get cleaned, same with the dryers that usually don't dry your stuff properly. It's ridiculous we have to pay at all.\n\n-Of course, rent is expensive everywhere, but to have the audacity to charge so much money for such an HORRENDOUS place to live is criminal.\n\nPlease don't move here, I promise you'll regret it.",

My apartment was flooded from a hot water heater leak in the apartment above and they continued to charge me rent for the unlivable apartment while I arranged moving and found a new place while unable to walk because of an ankle surgery I had a few weeks earlier. So argumentative and money hungry. The maintenance crew is great, but management is horrible! Also raises rent by about 17% for the next year so I just count my ability to break the lease as a God send in the end!",

It can get a bit loud (cars and neighbors) and you don't really get much of a chance to know who your living with other than gender before fully commiting to a room. I got very lucky and have fantastic roommates though. You do get your own room with a lock and key. mine comes with a space with pretty good size for price in this area (a twin bed was a good call though) the laundry room requires a key they give you and you do have to pay for the machines. But the rent is a straight fee which is fantastic!! Easy to budget. Over all this place feel pretty safe and it's a great place to start off. Also staff is very friendly ",

After hearing nothing 3 months after their approval process was supposed to begin and you've sought housing elsewhere you'll get a call saying you've been approved, hopefully the other places haven't already approved/don't have nonrefundable deposits.\n\nThey have waitlists multiple times longer than the amount of available units just so they can keep the waitlist fees when you have to find housing elsewhere. Only upside is the waitlist fee was on the lower side at $100, but that still means the company pockets $1,000+ just by being slow and keeping names in a queue.",

        "review": "Ive lived in Viking Gardens for about a year, and up until now I have had a fairly good experience renting here.\nMy main problem with WWU Living involved an issue with my renters insurance. If you have renters insurance from a provider other than e-premium be prepared to prove that you not only have proof of renters insurance but that you also have proof of a $100,000 general liability in your renters insurance policy. And be sure to show that proof of a $100,000 general liability in your policy right away when management asks for it- or else management will charge you a $30  non-compliance fee. Beware. I rarely give reviews online- especially with my name attached to them- but I wanted to let others know in the hopes of helping them avoid a situation like mine with their renters insurance.\nOther than that the apartment itself is fine and the location is very nice, which is the reason why this review is 2 stars rather than 1.",

We regret to hear that you are frustrated by having to provide proof of renters insurance but appreciate the chance to turn your experience around. We would be happy to reverse the non-compliance fee, if you can show that you have had an active policy. You will find that this is a fairly common practice at apartment communities because unfortunately, not all residents are so responsible to keep active policies, so it has forced us to these standards. Our community manager is available to speak with you more regarding this matter, and to reverse any fees that should not have been assessed. We look forward to hearing from you."

When applying to this place they make sure that you put down a $100 \"holding deposit\" but dont get confused because if you dont cancel within 24 hours you lose it! so after weeks of calling and hearing nothing back I attempted to call and get my deposit back only to be hung up on and told it was policy.

        "review": "WWU living is absolutely the worst company I have ever been forced to deal with.\n\nGiven their reputation I never in my life would have considered living with them of my own will, but they took over the apartments I was living in that were controlled by Landmark when I moved in.\n\nAs soon as they took over, they raised the rent from 1050 to 1500, and in the letter that they put in everyone's doors to announce this they also told us they knew this would result in most of us moving out and that was okay with them. They had absolutely no problem taking over and kicking roughly 300 people out of their homes.\n\nAfter they took over the quality of our interactions did not improve any, they did tons of remodeling with the current residents living there and often did not give apt notice for the projects that they were performing. One time I remember opening my front door and all the flooring had been removed from the hall and some glue was setting on the ground. Never received any notice or heads up but I could not leave my apartment for like 3 hours.\n\nAnother time they dropped unsolicited lease addendums that they just wanted everyone to sign and give back to them, like forcing a lease addendum on a current resident is not totally and completely illegal. They ended up sending them another 2 times when no one signed them, but there are multimillion-dollar lawsuits that have been won for forcing a lease addendum on a current lease.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this company to anyone. Every time I've gone to their office, I've been told that there is nothing they can do, and really nothing they are willing to do.",

        "review": "The room and location are fine. However, it seems there are more people living here than there are parking spaces. Every time I leave then come back I'm looping round and round the area praying someone leaves so I can park. I've been late to class several times because of this. Due of the lack of space I've been forced to park on campus, I've spent over $150 parking on campus due to not finding parking at the complex I pay $725 a month for. Very, very, very, very frustrating. I've had to walk a quarter mile with groceries because of this parking issue. Assigning folks their own parking space needs to be a priority. I rather make the commute from my folks home which is over an hour away than renew my lease.\n\nI never give out reviews but I'm frustrated with this place because of this. I don't want people committing here who work evenings and come home to no parking spots then having to settle with parking a lot farther than they need to. We're students and have assignments to turn in before certain deadlines, we need to make it to our classes on time, etc. Having parking assigned to folks should be again, a priority.",

          "text": "Hi Alexander,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to reach out and let us know of your concerns. We understand that the parking can be difficult to find at times and that alone is frustrating. We have had many discussions on how to improve the parking at all our sites and the only issue we continue to run into is there are not enough spaces to assign everyone a spot. It would require us to assign spots on a first come first serve basis. We have not ruled this idea out but are still discussing what would be the best option. We do offer our residents the ability to park at any of our other sites if its an uncovered space should you not find any parking at University Heights. Our neighboring community Taylor Heights, does offer reserved spots and garages that you can pay for to ensure you have a spot to park in.  Again, we apologize finding parking has been such a frustrating experience and we hope to improve the situation as soon as possible. We would be happy to meet with you and discuss any further suggestions you may have."

Because their tenants are students, you will often not be treated as an adult. If you don't know anything about property management companies and leases, I recommend consulting with someone who does anytime you have an issue with them to ensure your rights as a tenant are not violated.",

        "review": "WWU living is the worse management. Awful communication, way over priced. A lot of complexes in a college town won't be great but WWU living is the worse by far. I recommend Son Rise, or Landmark. You'll get more bang for your buck and more empathy from the offices. Or honestly any other company, as long as it isn't this one.\n\nHeres my review for their property Sky Vue: \"I'd give 0 stars if possible. It's a college town so there's not going to be much, if any, great property managements. However stay away from this one, seriously, it's the worst one I've ever dealt with. If I would've known Landmark was selling I wouldn't of wasted my time moving in just to be basically forced to move out a few months later. They increased the rent by over 50%, utilities aren't included anymore. The barbecue place they talk about is a drive away, not on location. Also their pictures are inaccurate. There is one specific picture with bar stools, the bar top can barely hold something the size of a candle. I moved into a 2 bedroom, 1.5 bath. The master has 2 closets and a half bath and its huge. The 2nd room is probably half the size, 1 closet, and has to share a bathroom but Pacific Living is charging only $10 less for the 2nd bedroom. I've also been told that you are not allowed to share a bedroom with anyone. And they rent out by the room, I'm not a Western student, I don't want some random person living with me. The parking is awful. You get 2 parking passes, even for the 3 bedroom, and there is never enough parking. No guest parking, and they hand out parking tickets often. The management is the absolute worse at communicating, for instance we stopped receiving mail due to mailbox damage and was never informed our mail was being directed off site. The location is awful anyway, I wake up constantly due to the freeway. Oh and the fire alarm goes off often, so the whole building has to evacuate. I could go on but moral of the story: they only care about taking all of your money. You can find somewhere much better for cheaper. I enjoyed living in Son Rise properties.\n\nBy the way, it's super sketchy you won't even allow us to be there for the final walk through. It's not our fault everyone is moving out due to the rent hike. Also, how do you not have corporates phone number? I need to speak to someone higher up then WWU living since you aren't willing to help me. You put me on hold for 7 minutes just to tell me you can't find the phone number.\"\n\nThey also added fake reviews to up their ratings, and once someone pointed it out the reviews were taken down and not addressed.",

        "review": "My son rented from Painless Property for the 2014/15 Western Washington University school year.  We unfortunately didn't actually look at the space he rented until after we signed a lease.  As his parent, I paid the rent monthly and paid all up front costs for securing the space.  The company charged me $40 for application fee, $20 as co-signer & $200 for non-refundable administrative fee.  Plus, they charged a $150 damage deposit fee that they subtracted $40 from after he moved out for not cleaning his window track.  And, the minimum amount of time for lease was 10 months, even though he was living there for only 9.  We basically had to pay 1 month for nothing.  Additionally, we were shocked when he moved in to find out he was renting a 5 x 6 foot bedroom for $525 per month.  The shared kitchen and dining area were even smaller than his private bedroom.  You couldn't even fit a couch in the space nor a table to eat on.  Overall, the place is poorly maintained and the managment is not easy to work with (especially Michelle).  The managment takes no responsibility for anything as they blame everything on the young people who are easy scapegoats for their unconscionable business practices.  Recommend that you check the place out thoroughly before you sign anything.  For the cost they charge (over $2000 per rental unit), the renters should get a lot more in return than they do.",

My roommates and I have put in a couple of requests for maintenance, and he has been the one to assist us each time. He has always been on point and punctual in communication, let's us know when he's coming by, shows up on time, and has done an incredibly thorough job in repairs, while explaining what and why he's doing what he's doing. He's incredibly versed in his technical knowledge related to his trade, articulates his work very well, and he's explained a lot of things that are helpful to know in a situation where maybe I'd be on my own, and would need to take matters in to my own hands to fix it.

The day my daughter was supposed to move in they did not have a key that worked for her room. The kitchen and living room were very  run down. Awful experience.",

          "text": "Hi Mary, I am sorry you feel that way, but due to the limited availability in the market and high demand of units we give the option of securing it by signing the lease before move-in. Please take into account that your daughter was moving in halfway through the school year into a unit with residents who had already been living there. Our team wants to help make this a great living experience for your daughter and if there is anything we can do to help during this transition please reach out to us or stop by the leasing office. Thank you, Your dedicated staff at WWU Living"

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>In this article's overview of WWU Living - University Heights, it's important to note that some residents have had positive encounters with specific staff members. Maintenance staff, in particular, have been praised for their helpfulness and professionalism. The attentiveness and technical skill of certain maintenance workers have made significant positive impressions on residents, providing prompt and thorough service.</p><p>Additionally, the new management team has made strides in improving resident satisfaction through friendly and professional service. Efforts to engage the community, such as arranging free lunches during finals week, have created a welcoming atmosphere that some tenants greatly appreciate.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>The location of WWU Living - University Heights is consistently mentioned as one of its greatest advantages. Notably, the proximity to campus and local transportation options offers a convenient solution for students. Residents also express appreciation for having rent charged per room rather than for the entire apartment, which can help with budgeting and reduce financial strain.</p><p>Furthermore, some residents acknowledge that the management has made efforts to fix up apartments and attend to repairs. The office staff's friendliness and willingness to assist with roommate issues, despite the property's limitations, have also been highlighted positively, suggesting a degree of responsiveness from the team.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, user reviews also convey a range of problems with the property. Residents encounter issues with limited parking and inadequate space, which leads to stress and inconvenience, particularly for those with tight schedules. There are also multiple complaints regarding maintenance entering private rooms without adequate prior notice, which raises concerns about privacy and respect for tenants' rights.</div><p>Another recurring complaint is the subpar apartment conditions upon move in, with some tenants finding their units dirty or poorly maintained. Issues with mold and unreliable internet service further indicate a lack of proper upkeep and infrastructure support for residents.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most alarming criticisms involve management practices that border on unethical. Residents recount experiences of miscommunication, such as being promised five-bedroom apartments only to be told none were available after signing the lease, effectively trapping them into a contract under false pretenses. There are also allegations of being overcharged or wrongfully losing security deposits, with notable difficulties in retrieving owed money.</p><p>Additionally, opinions on communication with management are overwhelmingly negative. Users report a severe lack of responsiveness to urgent issues, unreliable office hours, and a general sense that management is not truly invested in tenant welfare. Such poor management conduct, coupled with excessive and unjustified fees, contributes to a distressing living experience for many residents at University Heights.</p></section>"
