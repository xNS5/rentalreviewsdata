        "review": "I would give RPM 0 stars. Their customer service sucks and they take advantage of college students. If you are a college student DO NOT RENT FROM RPM!!!\n\n** response to RPM:\nThe move out costs were not my issue, my issue was the horrible customer service not only after I had already moved out, but also throughout the year I rented from you. I never received a polite response to any communication with you and was always responded to with attitude when I was being complete professional with you. RPM is overall a bad company and I think other rental companies in the Bellingham area are better to rent from (I.e., Hammer properties).",

          "text": "Ginae, all fees etc. are clearly listed in the lease and communication is sent out regularly between the tenants and the property management team.  We don't have any hidden costs etc.  The move out instructions were clearly communicated via email and posted to your front door, so that there would be no confusion.  They were not followed and the appropriate fees, per the lease, were applied. "

        "review": "Awful management.  Just look at high numbers of 1 and 2 star reviews.  The concern I had was so poorly managed I wonder if the property owner know or care about the renters' dissatisfaction?  Or perhaps the same ownership.  If you manage student housing where many remote parents send monthly payments, why not offer ACH direct bank deposit instead of expensive 2.85% credit card payment method?  RPM also accepts Bill Pay but that's not always reliable as physical mail can, and do get lost.  Why make it so difficult to make payments while charging 10% late fee?  The payment method is antiquated at best, but the real issue is how the RPM manages concerns.",
        "owner_response": {
          "text": "(Reviewer is not a tenant with RPM) We take our tenants concerns very seriously and respond (typically in writing) as clearly and quickly as possible.   We have several available payment options and are looking in to adding ACH to our platform in the future."

        "review": "I lived here for the 2019-2020 school year and in that time our apartment flooded twice. My roommate and I had to hound them to take action, and never gave us a confirmation that there was no mold damage. The apartments themselves are look worn in and not worth the price, they took 1/2 of our deposit and up-charged us for cleaning and replacements. Like the other reviews say, Gustavo is truly the best part of this place always reliable and went above and beyond to help us with our flooding.",

        "review": "Been living in the New England Apartments for about 5 months, and I know we will not be returning next year. The apartments aren't bad, for factoring in price and proximity to campus (as I am a student). But there have been multiple incidents with the staff at RPM being unorganized (like forgetting that we had paid our rent and going as far as sending us emails that we would be charged late fees, for example). The parking is an ABSOLUTE FRICKIN NIGHTMARE, and is the primary reason as to why we are leaving. 80% of the spots are so small that you can only park in if you don't expect to get out of your car - and on top of that, it's not regulated, so it's cool that it's free, but I'd honestly rather pay to have a guaranteed spot for my car. On top of that, when cars are parked incorrectly (e.g. taking up multiple spots) for several days, they will usually get called in to RPM, someone will come tape a sign saying that they've taken your information and need to move your car or it will be towed, basically. This happened to someone in my time here. You know how long it took RPM to tow their car after they put the sign on it? LONGER THAN A MONTH. (It deserved to be towed because at this point it had been there at least a week before someone called it in, and had the sign on the car for a very long time. The only reason they get 2 stars is for the okay-ness of the apartments and the AWESOME maintenance guy, Gustavo. If anything ever breaks, or sometimes is even just old, Gus will just go ahead and replace it for you. RPM - I hope you give him a raise, he's very kind and is great at what he does.",

        "review": "In my experience, RPM consistently missed any expectations or standards a realty company should be held to. The company knows they can charge asinine fees to unknowing college students and not suffer any consequences, outside of their universally poor public image. In my year with them we encountered false police/noise reports with $100 fees tacked on, water damage from a burst water heater, (which was much more catastrophic to other units in our building and without any compensation or apology on the part of RPM.) As well as a general lack of responsiveness to basic maintenance issues. The rent prices are exorbitant for the quality of service and housing provided and I would highly suggest taking business elsewhere.",

        "review": "Best place Ive rented in Bellingham. Clean and spacious apartments, maintence is prompt and the staff in the office are very helpful. I recently broke my foot and they were quick to accommodate me with parking to make my life 10000% easier, which they did not have to do (Bev you are the best!!). I am extremely grateful and so happy that Im renting with a company that is so helpful to its tenants. Everything is simple when dealing with the office when it comes to things such as lease transfers, maintence requests, and anything else really. Always been happy with the company. Only negatives is that the complex Im renting out has tight parking- however this is almost entirely due to college students not knowing how to park between the lines, and limited office hours.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Some user reviews highlight positive aspects of RPM Property Management, particularly their maintenance staff. One review mentions a maintenance worker who went above and beyond to accommodate a tenant recovering from an injury, showing promptness and kindness during the interaction. This level of customer service from individual employees, such as Gustavo, has been praised for addressing issues quickly and effectively, leaving a good impression on satisfied tenants.</p><p>Another review indicates that some tenants find the apartments to be clean and reasonably spacious, appreciating the proximity to campus for college students. Additionally, a reviewer expressed gratitude for the helpfulness of the office staff, noting that management is straightforward when handling lease transfers and maintenance requests, which reflects a level of organization and care from certain employees in the company.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>While there is limited high praise for RPM Property Management, a few users have rated their experiences positively, emphasizing specific elements that stood out. Residents have mentioned excellent accommodation and assistance from the maintenance staff, who seemingly strive to ensure tenant comfort despite the company's shortcomings. This focus on individual responsibility by staff can sometimes compensate for discontent with overall management practices.</p><pAnother response noted how certain aspects of the living situation, such as cleanliness and spaciousness of the apartments, can be favorable for students looking for convenient housing options. Although this perspective is overshadowed somewhat by larger complaints, it does suggest that not all tenants have had entirely negative experiences, pointing to the potential for RPM to improve if they leverage these strengths in maintenance and tenant interactions.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>User reviews frequently express frustration with RPM Property Management's customer service and communication, indicating a pattern of disorganization. Multiple tenants reported incidents where the company forgot about rent payments and sent erroneous late fee notices, which caused a substantial amount of unnecessary stress. This lack of attention to detail demonstrates a broader issue of ineffective management, which has led many residents to choose not to renew their leases.</p><pAdditionally, the quality of the apartments has come under fire, with reviews mentioning issues like flooding and insufficient responses to maintenance requests. Some users have cited exorbitant fees and poor handling of tenant concerns, undermining the value residents feel they should receive for the rent they are paying. This sentiment reflects a widespread consensus among many tenants: RPM often fails to meet their expectations regarding quality housing and responsive management.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pThe most concerning feedback involves the company\u2019s handling of critical issues, such as maintenance neglect and the retention of security deposits. One reviewer recounted harrowing experiences with floods in their apartment, which garnered little response from management despite repeated communication efforts. This demonstrated negligence could lead to serious long-term consequences for tenants who may face additional expenses and inconveniences due to unaddressed problems.</p><pMoreover, many reviews depict a pervasive atmosphere of dissatisfaction and resentment among tenants regarding fees associated with the property. Instances of users being charged for issues largely beyond their control, coupled with accusations of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of college students, paint an ugly picture of a company prioritizing profits over tenant welfare. Such experiences signal serious need for RPM to overhaul their approach to tenant relations and property management practices to regain trust within the community.</p></section>"
