        "review": "Had two people tell me the manager called them a \"nasty person\" after rightly asking for their deposit back.\n\nThey will charge you and arm and a leg for light bulbs and the little pans beneath the stove so document that those are working and get your $$ back when you move out.\n\nThey told my partner he would never get a good review from them threatening his future housing options. He was never late on rent one time, the apartment was perfectly clean, there were 0 complaints from neighbors, and he had submitted 1 maintenance request. The reason they refused to write him a future review was because we fought within the law to get his deposit back (and we did because they tried to legally withhold it). Wouldn't rent from them. They should be sued for this type of behavior by the city.\n\nYou cannot threaten someone's housing when they legally have the right to their deposit back. Disgusting company. No ethics.",

Ocean view is nice and so is the newer building but it's just for high middle class if your a single individual. Nobody cares about single middle class people though, right? This country is not what it was promised to be. Quite unfortunate as a proud first generation American speaking. Still proud and no shade. All the best to westview going forward as I consider my options .",

        "review": "Update 07-03-24\nAll good things end I suppose. Kim Seitz kicked everybody out of the garage so they could clean it. Fine of course but told the handicapped residents they had to park in a gravel lot thats on an incline and cant park on the private road in front of the building! No handicap access to the building. So the 90 y/o with heart failuregood luck! Kim didnt care and simply said if they didnt drive they wouldnt need to worry about it. Real compassion from Kim to a resident that pays a lot of money for rent. Dont rent here! Kim is an awful person and treats residents like shes doing them a favor by leasing to them. If you're handicappedkeep looking! No handicap access to the building. The doors are large and heavy, so have fun trying to get a wheelchair or walker through one of them. The apartment is nice but Kim is the worst manager Ive ever dealt with.\n\nUpdate; 03-04-23\nIts been just over six months since my mother and I moved into our new home at The Weatherbymanaged by Westview Real Estate, and we couldnt be happier.\n\nThe relationship with the office staff has completely turned around and we both feel welcome and appreciated as residents. The unit is on the noisy side (Barkley Blvd) though we dont notice it anymore. The windows are well made and help insulate us from the street noise. The dishwasher is still super quietnot sure why that is thing but I just love it.\n\nThe property; hallways, grounds, garage are all well maintained and clean. Occasionally a fellow resident may forget to clean up after their dog, but that is more the exception and not the normin my opinion. There have been a couple of maintenance requests, however the staff took care of the issues (breaker tripping & lazy Susan hinge) quickly and as expected. The office staff also followed up with us to make sure the repairs are still good.\n\nWeve met many of our neighbors and people are happy to be here and most have extended their lease agreements. We did find it unusual that we were offered an extension roughly six months prior to our lease extending. The office staff explained that in a pre-lease market, this is normal. In any case, we are enjoying Barkley Village and The Weatherby so well that we planned on extending. The extension process took about 30 secondselectronic signature and that was it. There was a rent increase, however it was fare less than expected and reasonable.\n\nWe have enjoyed our time here thus far and happily accepted a lease renewal offer.\n\nMy mother and I rented a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom unit a couple of months ago. The initial relationship with the leasing staff was rocky, but I feel has improved since weve moved in. The unit is as advertised, and the appliances are very nice. The dishwasher is so quiet! We rarely hear our neighbors and our fellow residents are nice. The leasing office have been very responsive to the few2 maintenance requests since we moved in. The maintenance team have been professional and prepared to complete work in an efficient manner. My mother was so pleased that Kim and the maintenance team had installed a safety bar in her bathroom before we moved in. The hallways and trash areas are kept clean, the garage doors actually work to keep your car safe and the garage is well lit. What we would have liked to see when we moved in; how to operate the BBQ grill (the power source is not anywhere youd expect and not labeled at the time), a map that indicates where the mail room is for large packages (didnt know there was one, but there is), where the trash area is and what the process is to use the club room (still a little confused about that one). Im sure that Covid precautions had a lot to do with how tours were/were not done and move-in tours done. Anyway, for us it is a nice complex thats close to everything we need to keep our life moving. The relationship with the leasing staff is much better and I dont worry about anything anymorewe actually plan on signing another lease. If you move here, I believe youll be happy and very comfortable with your choice.",

        "review": "Congratulations, my first negative review goes to the thieves operating WestView Realty.\n\nThey should be in JAIL, not business.\n\nBe prepared to be lied to your face, hidden fees the day you move in, traps to steal your hard earned money and neglect like you've never experienced so they can gain from it.\n\nThe experience I had with this leasing agency was an absolute nightmare. From the very start, they were masters of deception, leading you with false promises, hidden fees popping up on moving day, and manipulative traps designed to snatch your hard-earned money away. The team's lack of professionalism and transparency was glaring, leaving you feeling swindled the moment you handed over your deposit. If you have any concerns, be prepared to be ignored over and over again. Expect to pay way more than the advertised price and kiss your deposit goodbye.\n\nThey operated like thieves, sucking the life out of every penny you have. This whole ordeal felt like a robbery, and dealing with them was akin to being drained of every drop of trust and satisfaction.\n\nIn my opinion, this agency stands as a testament to the worst in the industry, making it an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.\n\nYou've been warned. Run as soon as you read this, PLEASE!",

        "review": "Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Westview Realty unless you enjoy headaches and disappointment.\n\nFirst off, getting a response from these folks is like trying to summon a ghost. I had to send carrier pigeons to get any info on the leasing process. They're on some other level of unresponsiveness.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the paperwork. It's like they handed me a puzzle instead of a lease agreement. I asked for clarification, and it was like talking to a brick wall. Good luck understanding anything without a cryptographer on speed dial.\n\nOnce I finally signed my soul away, I walked into a property that looked like it hadn't seen a vacuum or a paintbrush since the '90s. They must have missed the memo about basic cleanliness and maintenance. Dog urine on the floor of the elevator and trash on the entry floor.\n\nOh, and the maintenance requests? I might as well have sent a message in a bottle. I had a leaking sink that turned into a mini swimming pool before they bothered to send someone over. Apparently, they're on island time when it comes to fixing things.\n\nYou can tell these baboons are savages, by the look of their eyes you can tell they are money hungry and given the other reviews I've read I sense that I will be charged thousands for petty stuff. Save yourself the trouble. There are plenty of other leasing agencies that actually give a damn about their tenants. This one's a dumpster fire you don't want to get close to. NO TENANT APPRECIATION!

        "review": "Westview is a real estate company that also does property management. Meaning, there is a process they explain to lease and a criteria you must meetthey arent messing around so read it carefully. Another example; most apartment communities dont charge their residents $50/hr labor plus parts for maintenance that they determine is not normal wear and teardamage I understand, a clogged/leaky toilet I do not. The security deposit is equal to a months rent. The leasing staff in particular Kira Boardman should be locked away from future tenants. She doesnt communicate well, rude and unprofessional. For example; my handicapped wife sent her questions regarding accommodations for the shower, Kira didnt return phone calls/emails, claimed she didnt receive them or turfed the call to a colleague that didnt know what my wife was asking about. On the two occasions that we actually spoke with Kira, her tone of voice was demeaning and subordinate. She made comments like, we dont normally even discuss safety bars until a candidate is approved., or if youre not happy with our service, youre welcome to walk across the street, though we own that as well. When we signed our leasewith a colleague of Kiras, we didnt receive a welcome letter, a happy to have you with us or any hint that we were welcome at The Weatherby. People behave the way the do for many reasons. We were looking for a very specific apartment in a specific type of area. The Weatherby fit our needs well. So we rented for those reasonsunderstanding that we arent necessarily welcome by the leasing staff. If you choose this community, make sure that read the documents as though it were a mortgage and youre renting it with your eyes wide open. Hopefully others will have a better experience. Best of luck!",

        "review": "A sprinkler bursted at an apartment complex (broadway apartments) the customer service has been terrible. The way that the workers talk to people about situations and their frustrations is so wrong, if you work in customer service act like it. For example a very important email about everything that happens was supposed to get sent but that didnt happen so the next day we called and a woman answered and just said oh I forgot to send it. Mind you she was so rude and dismissive about everything. Saying  its not any new information you dont already know. Completely unprofessional. Expecting everybody to move right now like we have places to go automatically. It's a whole apartment complex don't expect everybody to have a place to go this could be their only option so why don't you guys try to be more sensitive about that. With that being said y'all need to get your words straight, saying we can get our rent and deposits back if we move, like you have to give us that anyways because we have to leave with causes that was not created by us. I get that you need to fix this problem but its not like it's not livable. People need time to figure stuff out. Think about the families. Or people that live paycheck to paycheck you think they can just move without their deposit back and getting rent back because you usually needs first months rent right? Sucks for people that don't have the money. Where they gonna go? The street? Right, you can't help us find housing. Oh don't get me started in maintenance. Still waiting for the second shower rod to get fixed and moved in august and now it's January. Had to fight to even get the blinds fixed in the front window of the apartment where everyone can just look in. Listen do not ever go with Westview. 10/10 do not recommend.",

        "review": "I would leave no stars if I could, because working with the Westview Real Estate team has been nothing but frustrating for the duration of the time that I lived here.\n\nThe girls working in the office are unresponsive and unwilling to assist in any questions or needs the tenants at this unit may have. Any time I go in I feel like I'm wasting my time because I get zero help and leave their office/phone calls/emails feeling like I would get more advice talking to a balloon. You can tell that none of the office workers have worked with tenants before, and I understand that they may not actually care if someone approaches them with a concern but a huge part of customer service is at least PRETENDING to care.\n\nWestview has a tendency of not taking care of problems when they're brought up. Upon move in I was supposed to receive 2 keys to the unit, one for my spouse and I but it turns out they lent one to a painter, or the previous tenant had it, or something (they were unsure) so they told me to simply \"make another key\". Very comforting knowing that someone out there had a key to my unit for over a year that I lived there, but hey it wasn't 'their problem' so they did nothing about it. They could have at least changed my locks.\n\nThat wasn't even the worst part about my experience moving in. The worst part was being told via email 2 HOURS before my official move in date that they were going to have to push my move in date back over a week because my unit was deemed 'uninhabitable'. So I was stuck sitting outside of my unit with 2 trucks full of household items with no where to go, and did they offer to put us up in a hotel or anything? No. Westview simply said \"talk to your renters insurance and they'll pay for that\". After speaking to my renters insurance they said that that should have 100% been Westview's responsibility since they broke our contract but they didn't care. So my spouse and I couch surfed for another week while leaving all of our belongings in an open vehicle parked for a week. Thanks Westview!\n\nWhen I moved in there was still litter on my windowsills, holes that had not been cleaned up, mold in the dishwasher, and more. However, if you want someone form Westview to actually come and help fix anything they charge a minimum of $50 just for coming out. So yes, that means they charge $50 for replacing a lightbulb. I found this out the hard way. I lived in a unit with 20ft ceilings and would stack a ton of stuff up high so I could climb to reach high bulbs and spots; however they still managed to charge for the replacements of lightbulbs that were 'burnt out' upon my move out...which amounted to about $70 in total. When, I had replaced ALL of the bulbs 8 days prior to move out. There's many other things like this I could go on about but I'll leave it at that.\n\nFor at least 4 months when I lived at one of their units the garage doors were busted so that anyone could wander in and approach the cars of the tenants; I had stuff stolen from my parking space, found shattered glass, litter, etc and Westview wouldn't do the slightest thing about it.\n\nAlso, the girls in the office tend to simply lock their doors without warning or a sign during their normal business hours on rent due days, be gone during the weekend, and then try to charge a late fee when you couldn't get your check dropped off. (May I add they charge about $50+ to pay online with a card). This was pre COVID by the way, so it was very frustrating. If you're not going to be in the office during regular business hours, at least leave a sign on the door. Send an email, anything; so that when your tenants are trying to pay their rent on time they actually can.\n\nThere's a lot of other things I could mention here but hopefully you sense the theme. I had a very unprofessional and negative experience working with Westview despite how expensive it is to live here. If they could put some of the money that I'm paying them to actually make sure our services are operating (such as the garage doors) instead of pampering their office hamster that would be great.",

        "review": "We are currently residing in Los Angeles and have lived in Bellingham for years prior to moving down here. We are in the process of moving back and have been searching for housing in the area. We decided to place an application with their new property, The Weatherby.\n\nOur correspondences were with an agent named, Kim Seitz. Her lack of follow through and poor customer service during the process resulted in our decision to withdraw our application.\n\nWe had placed and application on their site this past weekend. We followed up with a call and spoke directly to Kim on Monday. We had requested availability of a 1 or 2 bedroom and she stated she would send us pictures through e-mail of a few units that were available later in the afternoon. She did not follow through, so we called again on Tuesday and left a message requesting to see pictures/floorpans of any available 1/2 bedrooms. Again, there was no follow through. We called on Wednesday, Kim answered and we asked her about the status of our application and if she could send us pics/floorplans of the 1/2 bedrooms as she shared she would earlier in the week.\n\nShe responded with a flat: \"I cannot move the process forward until the roommate places an application\". (We had no problem doing so as we both have rented and know this is standard procedure as far as being approved, but many places actually will send a notice or the agent will contact the primary applicant and tell them how to proceed for the \"roommate\". We were waiting to hear from the agent to know how to move forward as the primary was going to be fully rent responsible & able to afford place on his own while the roommate is on disability. We were unsure how to \"link\" the applications in the system.)\n\nThere was an awkward silence and I shared we could certainly fill out the application, but are you now saying that we can't see pictures of the 1/2 bedrooms that you stated earlier that you would send? She then shared she had been too busy and that she was there alone, etc. Keep in mind we had already placed $100 application fee. We could see on Craigslist that they only had 1  1 bedroom left, etc. and were growing concerned about availability.\n\nAt this point, we hung up quickly as we did not appreciate the lack of follow through, excuses, and frankly, the \"attitude\" displayed when we had waited patiently for pictures that she said she would send 2 days earlier. This apartment would have been $20,000-26,000 for a year lease that we were willing to commit to had we signed with them.\n\nWe wrote later stating that we were canceling the application. She continued to send a message about the 1 bedroom the following morning. We were potentially going to reconsider and \"just let things drop\" and we asked how much it would be as she did not include pricing for the unit. She then responded with the message below which showed quite a bit of immaturity, bringing up the conflict that was actually brought about by her lack of follow through initially and also not following up to explain how to link applications, etc. Most places we've rented the primary fills out the application first and then the roomate. Etc.\n\nAnd so, based on the lack of follow through, incompetence, immaturity, and unprofessionalism we decided to look elsewhere. I sincerely hope the property management company provides better training as moving is already extremely stressful and we didn't want the added stress of signing a lease with an agent who we didn't feel we could rely on to get back to us. And, one who made us feel uncomfortable in the process.\n\nWhy bother with a place that shows you UP FRONT that your business does not matter to them???  Thanks, but, UM, NO THANKS.",

        "review": "I would give zero stars if I could. The owner of this management group is the most heartless business owner ever.  Bellingham is such a kind, beautiful, and diverse area, and the owner has no interest but her own.  They don't even tell potential tenants to remove their shoes before entering a showing of someone's apartment.  Seriously, very awesome studios, and new, but over-paying and dealing with management ruins it all.\n\nEven when there was a shooting in the building,  management had the resolution of sending all delivered packages to their main office where we can pick it up during their business hours....what sort of solution is this for their tenants??  And of course they said they would not be liable for any missing packages with that idea.  Even when I forgot to give back the parking pass, they told me to put it in  the mail and it wouldn't be a problem.   When I got my deposit money back, they still charged me for it.  I called and they said they didn't receive it.  They are truly cruel to tenants.  If you live here, don't complain, because they won't let you rent with them every again-even if you pay rent on time and leave the place better than you got it.\n\nSuch a shame that these people delegate over innocent bellingham residents, they make Bham look so bad.  They have no sympathy, morals, or respect for anything.  The office crew thinks they have the most important  job and love telling tenants they are screwed...sorry...not sorry...bye...\n\nLong story short, anyone that writes a good review was either by one of the staff members or just paid to write google reviews.  Shows how shady they are.  It's not hard to be nice-especially to tenants that pay $1,000 a month for a studio, in bellingham...\n\nThe only  people that enjoy living here are irrational narks, and imagine having neighbors like that, with the management like West Views.  My neighbor went out on the street and protested against gays every single day.  This caused honking and riots outside of our entrance door.

We were IN THE OFFICE FILLING IT OUT. Absolutely ridiculous. The girl was rude and was less than apologetic. With the way that we were treated we wouldn't want to live there anyways.

        "review": "We are currently residing in Los Angeles and have lived in Bellingham for years prior to moving down here. We are in the process of moving back and have been searching for housing in the area. We decided to place an application with their new property, The Weatherby.\n\nOur correspondences were with an agent named, Kim Seitz. Her lack of follow through and poor customer service during the process resulted in our decision to withdraw our application.\n\nWe had placed and application on their site this past weekend. We followed up with a call and spoke directly to Kim on Monday. We had requested availability of a 1 or 2 bedroom and she stated she would send us pictures through e-mail of a few units that were available later in the afternoon. She did not follow through, so we called again on Tuesday and left a message requesting to see pictures/floorpans of any available 1/2 bedrooms. Again, there was no follow through. We called on Wednesday, Kim answered and we asked her about the status of our application and if she could send us pics/floorplans of the 1/2 bedrooms as she shared she would earlier in the week. \n\nShe responded with a flat: \"I cannot move the process forward until the roommate places an application\". (We had no problem doing so as we both have rented and know this is standard procedure as far as being approved, but many places actually will send a notice or the agent will contact the primary applicant and tell them how to proceed for the \"roommate\". We were waiting to hear from the agent to know how to move forward as the primary was going to be fully rent responsible & able to afford place on his own while the roommate is on disability. We were unsure how to \"link\" the applications in the system.)\n\nThere was an awkward silence and I shared we could certainly fill out the application, but are you now saying that we can't see pictures of the 1/2 bedrooms that you stated earlier that you would send? She then shared she had been too busy and that she was there alone, etc. Keep in mind we had already placed $100 application fee. We could see on Craigslist that they only had 1  1 bedroom left, etc. and were growing concerned about availability. \n\nAt this point, we hung up quickly as we did not appreciate the lack of follow through, excuses, and frankly, the \"attitude\" displayed when we had waited patiently for pictures that she said she would send 2 days earlier. This apartment would have been $20,000-26,000 for a year lease that we were willing to commit to had we signed with them.  \n\nWe wrote later stating that we were canceling the application. She continued to send a message about the 1 bedroom the following morning. We were potentially going to reconsider and \"just let things drop\" and we asked how much it would be as she did not include pricing for the unit. She then responded with the message below which showed quite a bit of immaturity, bringing up the conflict that was actually brought about by her lack of follow through initially and also not following up to explain how to link applications, etc. Most places we've rented the primary fills out the application first and then the roomate. Etc.\n\nAnd so, based on the lack of follow through, incompetence, immaturity, and unprofessionalism we decided to look elsewhere. I sincerely hope the property management company provides better training as moving is already extremely stressful and we didn't want the added stress of signing a lease with an agent who we didn't feel we could rely on to get back to us. And, one who made us feel uncomfortable in the process.  \n\nWhy bother with a place that shows you UP FRONT that your business does not matter to them???  Thanks, but, UM, NO THANKS.",

        "review": "It was a rough year living in this apartment complex, and the turmoil did not end when we moved out. Some of our concerns are outside of the direct control of the management company, but most are not.\n\nFirst, it is a loud place to live. We started on one side of the complex, and could rarely get a good night's sleep with the noise from both inside and outside the complex. We then moved to the other side, and the train on that side was very loud and disruptive. But neither of these things were in the control of the management company.\n\nWhat was under their control was their customer service. Rarely did we feel attended to. Requests for repairs were sometimes met, but we were just as likely told that a repair (a leak, a clogged toilet, etc.) was our responsibility and they would try to charge us for it. To be clear, they DID charge us for it and only after a good deal of complaint, did they remove the charges. As a renter, I believe it is the owner/landlord's responsibility to make repairs on the property. \n\nWhen we moved out, we were the final tenants in a six-year run of that particular unit. The carpets had never been replaced in that time. Before moving out, I consulted with Alyssa, the property manager. She told me that the life of the carpet was five years and so they would be replacing it. Normally, carpet cleaning is billed to the tenant, but not replacement, she told me. When we left, we cleaned the place fairly thoroughly and took pictures.\n\nIn the end, they decided to clean the carpet and charge us for it, which is gross, frankly. I feel bad for the next tenants. On top of that they charged us hundreds of dollars in labor for things like putting in new light bulbs and replacing the burner pans on the stoves. The job could not take more than a few minutes. Hundreds of dollars! \n\nI know the real estate market in Bellingham is tight, but if you can find another place, I would advise you do. You will lose most of your deposit, and a lot of sleep if you have to live there. \n\nWe are currently in dispute over our deposit. If they make good, I will change my review here to note that.",

It didn't help that my completely justified frustration with said 'quick fix' was met with a lot of unwarranted attitude and back-talk by one of the employees in the office. \n\nWhat was once a beautiful apartment complex, seemingly aimed at young professionals, has since become a dumping ground for rowdy college students, the hallways now trashed from spills of fluorescent yellow paint and what looks like vomit. The parking lot is littered with cigarette butts and trash, and so many poorly parked vehicles, overlapping your space and making it nearly impossible to get out. The traffic from the surrounding businesses regularly blocks parking access altogether. \n\nIt's really a shame; what would have been a 5 star review a few years ago is now barely deserving of 1.",

        "review": "I lived at the Shearwater for 4 years.  The apartment is a great place to live, very convenient location, with parking lot and in-unit laundry, which are both rare in a downtown facility.\nHowever, the management staff were problematic.  The building common spaces were dirty most of the time, the parking lot was never cleared of snow, the security gates often didn't close fully.  \nThe staff consisted of a claque of rude young individuals who seemed more interested in their social lives other than customer service.  Using Covid as an excuse, they kept their business doors locked and maintained short hours well after restrictions were listed.  If one had a regular job and needed some help after 4:30 in the afternoon, well too bad! I returned from a 3 week trip to find that my building key didn't work, they had changed the locks.  Luckily, I got into town early   that day so could get into their office door (not the office, just a crack in the door) and was given the new key. When asked what I would have done if I had gotten there half hour later, the reply was, \"We emailed you that you needed a new key\"  That did not answer my question, and when I searched all my email, plus spam, there was no email\nDuring the rent control, they insisted that they would demand their proposed back rent to be paid as soon as the rent control was lifted, so I should pay their rate even if I wasn't legally required.\nThe rules regarding the lease were rigid.  One had to notify them over 3 months in advance if you were going to renew, which was difficult in my work situation.  If you didn't tell them by that date, they threatened to rent the apartment out from under you.  When I finally retired and moved, the process of finding someone to take over my lease was bureaucratic, cumbersome, and inflexible, with tons of paperwork, and difficult for both myself and the individual taking over my lease. Plus they wanted me to sign documents which would imply I was still responsible for the next year's lease renewal, or so it sounded from what they were seemingly saying. This was at a time when there was a huge demand for rentals downtown, and they even refused to list my unit on their website as being available for rent.  \nIn summary, great apartment, lousy service",

The way that the workers talk to people about situations and their frustrations is so wrong, if you work in customer service act like it. For example a very important email about everything that happens was supposed to get sent but that didn't happen so the next day we called and a woman answered and just said \"oh I forgot to send it.\" Mind you she was so rude and dismissive about everything. Saying \" it's not any new information you don't already know.\" Completely unprofessional. Expecting everybody to move right now like we have places to go automatically. It's a whole apartment complex don't expect everybody to have a place to go this could be their only option so why don't you guys try to be more sensitive about that. With that being said y'all need to get your words straight, saying we can get our rent and deposits back if we move, like you have to give us that anyways because we have to leave with causes that was not created by us. I get that you need to fix this problem but its not like it's not livable. People need time to figure stuff out. Think about the families. Or people that live paycheck to paycheck you think they can just move without their deposit back and getting rent back because you usually needs first months rent right? Sucks for people that don't have the money. Where they gonna go? The street? Right, you can't help us find housing. Oh don't get me started in maintenance. Still waiting for the second shower rod to get fixed and moved in august and now it's January.

        "review": "I lived in an apartment at a Westview Property downtown Bellingham for a month before moving out due to the level of noise in and surrounding the building, and had $750 deducted from my deposit despite ZERO damage or wear to the apartment (and having it professionally cleaned before leaving), and continuing to pay rent for the duration of my lease.\n\nThe first most important issue is the unbearable noise levels both inside and outside the building; I had a water-facing apartment, which initially seemed great, but ended up being so nerve-wracking because of constant noise I had to move out. \nThe noise ranges from blaring, extended horn blasts from trains passing by no less than 5 times a night at all hours of the night, constant construction noise (including incessant beep-beep-beeps from trucks backing up) from 7am-7pm 6 days a week from the waterfront development (which will be ongoing through 2019), amplified music from bands playing across the street at the Market every Saturday throughout the summer, loud DJ music from private parties at the Depot until as late as 2am, and drunk students yelling and carousing at an outdoor bar directly downstairs from the building from 6pm-11:30pm. \nInside the building, tenants blast music on a high-bass surround-sound stereo systems, and neither the walls, flooring or windows muffle sound. I could hear conversations my neighbors were having, along with other unmentionable things they were doing, every night.\n\nThe second big issue is the lease; it is wildly complicated and a lesson in why you should have an attorney review all contracts before signing - there are tons of hidden fees and unreasonable costs buried in the text of the multi-page agreement - and you will get money deducted from your lease no matter how untouched you leave your rental. I was in my apartment a total of 4 weeks and left the place immaculate, and was still charged a cleaning fee, plus fees for things like 1 roll of toilet paper I had left as a courtesy in the bathroom.\nThe management is staffed by people who don't seem to want to take the time to explain any of their policies; when I asked to have a move-out inspection done by my parents, who were co-signers on the lease, they made an appointment, then, told my elderly parents that they \"forgot\" the appointment when they showed up, and that they were not allowed keys or able to enter the apartment anyway even though they co-signed the lease. This was not mentioned at any point, or when I set up the walk through appointment. The staff also became terse, difficult and argumentative when my parents tried to ask them questions, so they ended up leaving feeling defeated and like they were treated poorly. \n\nThe apartment also had a bad, onion-y odor, my previously clear skin broke out shortly after moving in, and cleared up soon after I moved out.\n\nAll in all, after 25 years of renting apartments in cities large and small, this was one of the worst living experiences I've ever had, and despite appearances, the way this company treats people and gets their money - taking advantage of a high-cost rental market - is shameful. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone looking for a reasonably comfortable and quiet place to live.",

Improperly (and illegally) entering our apartment for a showing, thereby terrifying my roommate by having a strange man enter her bedroom while she was sleeping. They further locked doors to litter boxes repeatedly, and didn't lock the front door on another occasion. \n\nThey had the nerve to complain about the disarray the house was in, which was purely due to the typical chaos of taking everything out to get into boxes.\n\nLease here at your own risk!",

        "review": "DO NOT LIVE HERE!\n\nWhen I moved in, the carpet was not cleaned properly so I wrote on my intake form that it was okay and that there were spots on the carpet. \n\nI just received my security deposit back and they charged me $105 for regular cleaning and $120 for deep cleaning! The carpet was not deep cleaned when I moved in why should it be now. \n\nThey also deducted ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for changing of lightbulbs (THAT ALL WORKED WHEN I LEFT) and drip pans! Who charges for drip pans? That is supposed to be managements cost not the renters responsibility.\n\nI was accused of leaving items behind and plastic removal from garbage disposal yet it worked when I was there and I never would put plastic in the garbage disposal like an idiot. Also I cleared the apartment out when I left which makes no sense at all why they would charge for leaving items behind. \n\nAlso the maintenance team stole my power drill from my apartment. UNPROFESSIONAL! \n\nDO NOT LIVE HERE!",

        "review": "I lived in the Cornerstone Apartments for 5 years and on more than one ocassion I was subject to the penny gouging they routinely employ. Despite leaving a clean apartment I was charged for 4 hours of cleaning. i was also charged to clean nonexistent carpeting. They charge carpet cleaning by the sq ft and charge by the size of the apartment not the amount of carpet  Beware and demand your refund if you have moved from that complex. They also charged $100 to open my door after hours at 6 pm one night even though someone walked down the hallway and it took less than 2 minutes. Beware of west facing apartments , especially on the top floor. Temperatures hit over 90 degrees even with fans going and blinds drawn. Look elsewhere.",

        "review": "Westview doesn't care at all about the welfare of any individual residents. They are purely focused on making as much money as humanly possible. Providing consistent customer service is not one of their concerns. There is construction noise about 60-70 hours a week as they are building YET ANOTHER complex adjacent to mine (the Sandpiper). The active railroad nearby coupled with the several bars located on Railroad Ave pretty much guarantees you will have zero peace and quiet if you choose to live in any of these apartments. The rent is also ridiculously expensive for what you actually receive. The elevator is pathetically slow, which doesn't sound like a huge pain until you've had to take that slow elevator 100+ times. The building is dirty and rarely cleaned. Westview's employees are incompetent and apathetic and the lease has multiple contradictions. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE SCHMUCKS.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Westview Real Estate has received positive feedback from some tenants who appreciate the quality of their properties and the professionalism of their maintenance staff. One tenant highlighted how effectively the management handled quick repairs and found the team both accommodating and pleasant to deal with. They particularly praised the proactive approach to maintenance, which ensured that issues were addressed before they escalated into serious problems. Additionally, another tenant commended Westview's office staff for being consistently courteous and professional, detailing how management worked with them through a lease takeover process smoothly and efficiently. This indicates that some tenants find Westview's management reliable and their properties well-maintained, making them a solid choice, especially for those seeking prompt responses and organized management services.</p><p>Moreover, Westview's properties often receive remarks about their excellent condition and convenient locations. For instance, a tenant noted the \"virtually brand new\" condition of their apartment and appreciated its desirable location, justifying the premium rent demands. Such sentiments suggest that for tenants valuing a well-kept and strategically placed rental, Westview Real Estate can be an exceedingly good option. Others have shared their positive experiences with staff members who are ready to assist and facilitate repairs swiftly, further solidifying the company\u2019s reputation among satisfied tenants.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Despite the mix of experiences, Westview Real Estate has earned some glowing evaluations that underscore its strengths in customer service and property management. One resident praised the property management group as being the best they have ever rented from, noting the team\u2019s timely responses to maintenance requests. The reviewer appreciated the understanding nature of the staff, highlighting the flexibility they provided with rent payments during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. This display of empathy and adaptability earned Westview glowing recommendations from satisfied tenants. Additionally, long-term tenants have emphasized the positive experience stating that the staff is not only competent but easily approachable, offering assistance even before troubles arise, which speaks volumes about the level of care and attention provided by Westview Real Estate.</p><p>Another notable example involved a tenant who had lived at a Westview property for six years, expressing satisfaction with the prompt service and ongoing attention to maintaining a peaceful community atmosphere. The resident noted the continuous upkeep of complex amenities like garbage codes and parking gates, which were handled efficiently by the management. The personalized and attentive service played a key role in the tenant's decision to renew their lease yearly, establishing Westview as a standout choice in property management for individuals seeking consistent engagement and reliable residency experience.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>While Westview Real Estate has its strengths, several residents have shared concerning experiences, primarily revolving around customer service and communication issues. Tenants have reported neglect in addressing maintenance requests promptly, leading to frustration, particularly when issues were labeled tenant responsibilities without adequate assessment. For instance, tenants have expressed dissatisfaction with incidents where repairs were delayed or inadequately resolved, pushing the burden onto the residents who expected proactive solutions. The persistent delays and poor communication from the staff have left some tenants feeling marginalized and ignored, depicting an urgent need for improved correspondence and operational efficiency. Additionally, complaints were made regarding the leasing process, with several tenants expressing frustration over lack of follow-through from the staff, leading to an inconvenient and frustrating renting journey. Such feedback highlights a pattern where communication breakdowns result in tenant dissatisfaction, potentially marring the renting experience with Westview Real Estate.</p><p>In addition, residents have criticized certain policies and actions by management, particularly in relation to security deposit deductions, viewed as excessive or unfair. Many tenants have shared similar stories of substantial amounts being deducted from their deposits for questionable cleaning and maintenance charges. The repetitive nature of these complaints implies a systemic issue in the handling of deposit returns, leading renters to perceive Westview's practices in this area as less than trustworthy. Problems such as uncommunicative staff, unfounded charges, and the stress associated with securing the return of deposits illustrate the challenges faced by those renting through Westview, impacting the overall perceived value and experience for some clients.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most severe criticisms of Westview Real Estate touch upon allegations of ethically dubious practices and deeply negative interactions with management. Some tenants have recounted troubling experiences where the conduct of the property management personnel appeared adversarial and dismissive. For example, complaints of mismanagement in handling tenant issues extend to claims of being lied to and threatened regarding future housing references. An instance revealed a situation in which a tenant's request for their deposit return led to hostility and unprofessionalism from staff, creating a stressful and unpleasant leasing environment. Furthermore, numerous accounts describe the application process as unfairly competitive, whereas staff would entertain multiple applications simultaneously, leading potential renters to feel misled.</p><p>Another grave concern relates to the treatment of tenants and property conditions, where maintenance negligence has led to reports of unlivable circumstances such as burst sprinklers and unresolved safety hazards like faulty security gates. The purportedly unchecked attitude of management staff in dealing with these pressing issues has been a significant cause of tenant frustration. Residents describe a property management team that seems indifferent to serious tenant concerns, offering little to no remedy in situations requiring immediate attention. The stark disconnection between tenant needs and managerial action paints a disconcerting picture for future tenants considering Westview Real Estate.</p></section>"
