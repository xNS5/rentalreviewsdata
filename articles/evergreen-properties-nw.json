        "review": "Recently moved to Bellingham from Spokane.\nThe home I am renting needed a little work done when I arrived.\nCasey was exceptionally helpful and was quick to get everything resolved in a timely matter. He is the owner of Evergreen Property Management and strives to make his tenants happy and comfortable in their rental.\nHe is very kind, and really does care about your needs or concerns.\nIf he is ever running late to come fix something, he will always keep in touch.\nShana, who also works for him is also very kind and helpful.\nThis is honestly a great company, so if any doubts, just let them go.\nYou will always be cared for by Casey and Shana.",

        "review": "Evergreen Properties NW has been a DREAM to rent from and deal with as a tenant!  I had a bad taste in my mouth from other property management companies but Casey and his staff took that away from Day 1.  The very few times Ive needed maintenance, I never had to wait and it was taken care of asap.  Not only that, Casey & staff have gone above and beyond a few times when they didnt have to - ALWAYS with a smile, too. Evergreen Properties NW is a breath of fresh air when most companies these days have forgotten what good customer service is!  I will rent from them as long as I need to, for sure. I highly recommend them if youre looking to rent.",

        "review": "We rented from Evergreen Properties NW for approximately 5 years. We were in the unit for 6 years, but it was managed by another company for the first year or so. We are VERY glad that Evergreen Properties NW took over because from then on, everything was much smoother and the staff was much nicer. I suggest calling the office with questions or concerns, as they are more likely to answer the phone or call back instead of email. Casey is very kind and reasonable to work with. He did a great job with maintenance, but there was sometimes a delay in response. We moved out of state, otherwise we likely would have stayed until we saved enough to purchase a home!",

        "review": "Just took over a lease and the whole process was super easy. This is by far the most ethical property management company in the area. Casey specifically is very helpful and responds very quickly with any questions that you may have . Overall very happy with the moving in process.\n\n7/21/20 Almost two years later and this has been a fantastic management company to deal with. Our lease ends next month and we are moving into another place that is also managed by Evergreen. Lara has been beyond helpful as well as Casey. If you plan on renting in Bellingham, I would heavily consider using Evergreen. Nothing beats them!",

Casey works hard, however, unfortunately, he has abysmal staff who do not communicate with the tenant or with Casey appropriately.\n\nBetween rude and unprofessional text messages received by me from his assistant to clear miscommunication between Casey and his assistant, staff alone lost Casey a top review. Id lower it further if Casey were not a joy to work with.\n\nCasey, you run a strong business. I wish you every success and I hope you can find staff that match your dedication, kindness, and responsibility.",

        "review": "This was my experience with Casey and the group which was awful to say the least.\n\n- Casey was over an hour and a half late to the initial meeting to view the house.\n-The lease he sent over was full of errors.\n-Upon showing up to move in, the house was not cleaned and had a hole in the drywall.  After 3 days, Casey brought in a cleaning crew.  The cleaning crew threw away everything in the refrigerator.  Casey laughed about the situation, saying I guess I should have walked through the house before you guys moved in.\n-The house needed numerous fixes, fireplace, sink leaking, and several other fixes.  For items, like the fireplace, he said he would call a local company to come fix it.  I called the local company to confirm Casey has called them, it did not.  It took 3 months to fix the initial items from move in.\n-The house I rented had a deck which I told Casey numerous time about.  Finally, one of the boards broke under me creating a huge safety hazard.  When I told Casey about this, he said he could not touch the house without the owners permission.  What is the point of managing a property if you can not maintain issues? Especially huge safety issues like a broken board on a 10 foot tall deck.  The issue was never fixed.\n-Lara and Casey always complain of being too busy.  Issues with the house took a long time to resolve.  When I moved out, I still had unresolved maintenance claims after 2 years.\n-This is a second job for Casey as he often bragged about doing construction with the owner.  Again, why he often forgets or issues take a long time to resolve.\n-I had to break my lease which I understand should have some fees associated with it.  They tried to charge me fees that were not in the lease.  It took weeks of arguing and requesting the clause in my lease before they finally did not charge me.\n-Would not allow a lease take over as it was not their policy anymore but could not provide written proof of this.  It is funny how a below review states someone just took over a lease.\n-Charged me for the month of rent for April for my lease break but was fired half way through April and did not refund the rent for the rest of the month.\n-Would not do a final walkthrough of the house upon move out.\n\nI could go on and on about how terrible of a company this is or how much Casey/ Lara does not care about their tenants.\n\nResponse: Ah, yes Casey.  Tenants that pay rent on time and leave the place better than they found it are clearly the ones to avoid.  I apologize for being difficult and making you fix things, like a property manager is supposed to do.  And no, you did not work hard, it took weeks to get a response from you.",

          "text": "Oh, Bryant. This review does not surprise me.    Im sorry you feel this way. However, You and your perpetually bitter girlfriend were quite difficult most of time. (Tenants we strive to avoid if I had to be completely honest)  I personally worked with you on many occasions while you were in the process of searching for a home and put up with your dishonestly and excuses the entire time...Sadly, no matter how hard we tried, you werent pleased.  Fortunately for us, you guys moved on.  Please call the office and ask for Casey should you have additional concerns.  Id love to discuss this with you in person.\n\nBest of luck to you both!"

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>In this section, we explore some positive aspects of Evergreen Properties NW as highlighted in user reviews.

His prompt communication and willingness to resolve issues are recurrent themes, with tenants noting that he strives to create a comfortable living situation. The staff is also often mentioned as being courteous and helpful, addressing concerns efficiently. In particular, user reviews praised the company's readiness in handling maintenance requests, attributing a reliable and convenient rental experience to the management team's dedication.</p><p>Another plum in the company's reputation is its straightforward handling of leases and tenant transitions. Several users have described their move-in processes as smooth and stress-free, with staff assisting at every step. Reviews mentioned a few hiccups during check-in but appreciated how the company quickly addressed and resolved these issues, such as managing landscaping or addressing minor move-in concerns. This willingness to correct initial challenges has earned the company a significant amount of goodwill from its tenants.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>User reviews are peppered with high praise for Evergreen Properties NW, especially pointing to the exceptional customer service provided by Casey and his team. They have transformed potentially negative experiences from other property management companies into positive interactions. One tenant recalls how any maintenance needs were met urgently, and Casey frequently went above and beyond to ensure satisfaction. The sense of community and supportive atmosphere fostered by the management was frequently mentioned as a stand-out quality.</p><p>Many tenants feel that Evergreen Properties NW surpasses industry standards by providing a refreshing level of customer service. The property management company's efforts to fulfill maintenance requests with lightning speed and often with a smile make them a preferred choice in the Bellingham area. In a place where rental properties can be competitive, tenants have remarked they would happily continue renting through Evergreen due to their high standards for tenant care and service.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>While there is great praise, user reviews also present some drawbacks experienced by tenants. A few have faced issues with communication, specifically mentioning miscommunication between Casey and his staff, which occasionally led to confusion and frustration. A tenant expressed dissatisfaction due to unprofessional interactions with staff, citing rude exchanges and poor communication that failed to align with the owner's dedication and kindness.</p><p>Another issue that was brought up was a lack of response or delays in addressing some maintenance requests, with the office being occasionally overwhelmed during busy periods. A tenant noted that while Casey was supportive, delays in communication affected the overall experience, indicating a need for better communication channels and staffing to maintain efficiency as the company grows.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Some user reviews highlight glaring issues that have severely impacted tenant experiences, creating a negative perception of Evergreen Properties NW. There are reports of Casey being significantly late for appointments and numerous errors in lease documentation. One particularly negative review described a long list of unresolved maintenance issues, including a dangerous structural problem in their rented home. The staff was depicted as unresponsive, with some claims of neglected maintenance spanning years. This experience suggests lapses in management's ability to effectively resolve significant tenant concerns.</p><p>Further exacerbating the situation, there have been accusations of questionable business practices. A tenant detailed being charged inappropriate fees not stipulated in the lease, struggles in communication during a lease break, and unresolved security deposits upon departure. Another individual shared an incident where they made a long journey to view a property based on misleading availability information, resulting in wasted time and frustration. These instances point to serious coordination problems and perhaps a lack of due diligence, indicating areas where the company needs substantial improvement.</p></section>"
