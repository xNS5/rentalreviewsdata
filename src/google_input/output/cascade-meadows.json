        "review": "Absolutely horrible. I have been a tenant for 1 1/2 years and they have not once answered the phone, returned my calls, answered an email, or resolved any issues. The maintenance team has come in twice and left things in disarray and left their garage on my floors. Today they apparently came into my apartment while I was working and stole one of my kitchen drawers and left the stuff that was in said drawer dumped all over my countertop. I have even gone to the office in person with not much luck. I work in property management so I understand the ropes and this is the WORST property management I have experienced. I feel unsafe living here.",

        "review": "This place has gone really down hill, the dog waist trash cans are overflowing constantly, there seems to be garbage and dog waist everywhere. Its disgusting and un sanitary! There is almost never any dog waist bags either. There are random holes in the ground that Im constantly tripping on in the larger field, making it a safety hazard, and graffiti on the playground. The people working here always seem to be rude. They didnt put anything down when it got Icy and multiple people were slipping and falling. They just dont seem to care about there tenants at all.",

        "review": "We've lived here for years, the first half was great, the second half wasn't. What changed? The apartments got bought out by a different company. After the take over office hours seemed to be cut in half, and the overworked staff got rude, understandably as they now have the same amount of work to do, in about half the time. Our car has been broken into twice. The staff didn't even say \"that sucks\" just \"that happens\". Our upstairs neighbor is loud and vacuums as late as 4am. Despite it claiming in the lease this is against the policy, the staff refuses to do anything. Our lease ended this month, and we got a letter saying that our rent is going up by $175 dollars. Making our one bedroom cost more than our 2 bedroom 2 years ago! When we brought this up to the staff their response was \"well, now the two bedrooms are $1300. (This is untrue, our old roommate said the rent changed from 875 to 1200) and told my wife she could get a second job or go on government assistance! The nerve! Well we found a new apartment, and when we went to notify the office of our intent to move they told us that we are a day late for the 20 day prior. One. Freaking. Day. Late. So now we have to pay 387 dollars plus rent for everyday the apartment isn't filled with a new tenant. For being one day late. They refused to give us any leeway on this. Now here the real assinine part. We never intended to move until the beginning of this month, despite everything we were going to sign a new lease, until we saw that the rent was increasing by 175 dollars. We got that notice 30 days before we had to sign a new lease, and we have to give notice of intent to leave 20 days before the lease signing, meaning we had to find and get approved for a new apartment all within 10 days. I had to take sick days at work to do that. And we were still one day late. This place blows, no one move in.",

        "review": "The staff is overwhelmingly rude and disorganized. The people living here are shady and hostile. It's definitely not a place I recommend anyone to live. People steal the reserved parking regularly, there's garbage all over the parking lot, people are too loud. I couldn't tell you how many times I've woken up in the middle of the night on a work night because of the inconsiderate people living here. Maintenance issues also take about a month or so to get resolved.. So that's ALWAYS a plus",

        "review": "I agree with the negative reviews that seem to be everywhere about cascade meadows. i have been here for years and it gets worse every time. The extremely rude office ladies and a sarcastic and rude maintenance staff. even the most simple question is \"answered\" with a passive aggressive tone. my neighbors a few numbers down broke their lease to and had to pay around $1000 just to get out of here! the rent goes up every year and the quality of the apartment is pretty shabby. I could really go on about the disappointing facts that surround Cascade Meadows.",
