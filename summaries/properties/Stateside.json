This article is intended to be a tool to help potential renters in finding suitable property management or rental properties, and it includes summaries of user reviews of Stateside. The sentiment presented is a collection of both positive and negative aspects, aiming to provide a balanced overview.\n\n## Good\nResidents have praised Stateside for its luxury apartments aimed at students, citing the modern furniture and appliances, as well as the excellent location, which affords easy access to nearby shops, restaurants, and the WWU campus. The internet and gym amenities have satisfied some tenants, contributing positively to their living experience. Certain reviews also mention that the leasing staff is very informative and friendly, creating a welcoming initial interaction for prospective and current residents.\n\nAnother aspect that has received appreciation is the community atmosphere fostered by Stateside, with some residents enjoying the provided social gatherings. The responsive and professional conduct of the property management in dealing with inquiries was highlighted as a reassuring sign of quality service. This is further exemplified by the instances where maintenance concerns were resolved quickly and satisfactorily, enhancing the living experience.\n\n## Great\nThe architecture and design of Stateside have received high commendations, with some tenants enamored by the amazing views of the bay and the city from the buildings. The contemporary and clean design of the apartments seems to be a hit among the student demographic. Furthermore, amenities like free laundry services and a spacious community kitchen have been particularly well-received, as these features significantly contribute to the convenience of day-to-day living.\n\nEnthusiasm about moving in is another common theme among the reviews. Some residents have expressed their excitement, particularly praising the help and assistance provided by the leasing team. Positive experiences during tours and responsive communication with leasing managers suggest that customer service is an area where Stateside shines. This promising pre-move-in engagement paints a promising picture for future tenants.\n\n## Bad\nDespite the aforementioned praise, Stateside has not been immune to criticism, particularly concerning its parking situation. Residents have voiced frustration over the steep parking fees, with charges deemed outrageous by some, especially for those not willing or able to pay for gated parking options. Street parking is described as inadequate, adding a layer of inconvenience to daily life. Another concern raised by tenants is the return of security deposits, with some reviews stating unfair charges upon move-out, an issue that appears to be recurring.\n\nNegative remarks also extend to the cleanliness of the apartment complex; reports of unkempt common areas clash with the image of luxury living that Stateside aims to provide. The professionalism of the leasing staff has been questioned, too, with accusations of unprofessional behavior during the leasing process. These issues have contributed to a sense of dissatisfaction among a section of the residents.\n\n## Ugly\nA more troubling set of issues emerges from certain user reviews, pointing towards potentially deep-rooted management problems. Residents have complained about long response times and under-trained staff, which lead to further frustration and sometimes unresolved issues. The issue of elevators being out of service for hours has posed significant difficulties, especially for residents with accessibility needs, reflecting a lack of preparedness for emergency situations.\n\nFinancial grievances are another sore point. Some former tenants claim to have been continuously charged for utilities like electricity even after vacating the property. Additionally, there are accounts of Stateside engaging in price gouging practices, with sudden and steep increases in parking and, presumably, rental costs, affecting affordability and tenant satisfaction. Aspects such as these contribute to creating a tumultuous living environment for some of the residents at Stateside.\n\nThis article utilizes the broad spectrum of user reviews to provide a nuanced view of Stateside property management.
