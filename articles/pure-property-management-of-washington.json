From the start, everything went smoothly, thanks to Celese, who helped us move in. She was incredibly professional, friendly, and attentive to our needs, making the transition seamless.\n\nThe property itself was in excellent condition, and any minor issues we encountered were promptly addressed by the team. The level of communication and support from PURE has been top-notch, giving us peace of mind as new tenants.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend PURE. Their exceptional service and dedicated staff, especially Celese, have made our move a great experience. Thank you for making us feel so welcome!",

So because I live next door to the property that you manage you dont feel like you have no responsibility to respond to my many phone calls and emails? I have heard nothing.

It took me resorting to outrage to get a response that took twelve days and has yet to solve any issues.  This company is not worth losing your money to, absolutely embarrassing that they call themselves professional but cant even rent a secure unit out.",

This is an absolutely horrible and down right disgusting rental company dont waste your time going through them and dont expect your deposit back soo if you do rent through them just leave the place trashed when you leave. When we moved out of the resident we were ever paying in rent the house should be condemned and we actually left it cleaner than when we moved in and they have the audacity to send me a $100 check out of the $2500 deposit I had to put down to move in to the run down brick house from the 40s that is literally falling apart.

It has been over a month and I still haven't received my security deposit and the property is already listed for sale. I've been calling, left messages and no call back to explain what is going on. I visited the office everyday and it's always locked and has a sign saying all managers are in the field. Why would they have an office if they are always on the field, makes no sense. It's very unprofessional that the company does not return my calls or emails to explain what is going on. I've rented from different management companies and I've always gotten my security deposit within a month from the move out date. I am very disappointed with this management company.",

Communication is incredibly slow and poor, they charge a rental package thats supposed to include setting up your utilities but we still had to call the gas company to setup our own gas and then dealt with scary gas and carbon monoxide leaks in the unit due to an ancient valve that shouldnt have even been there and then when replaced wasnt even tightened properly.

This property management found a legal loop hole to displace my single mom and her 3 kids during the pandemic, stating in a letter that they intend to move into the property themselves within 60 days. Prior to this during their lease, they contacted the management about a septic problem with the house. The management did not send someone out to check the issue and continued to be unresponsive. During the wait our family was able to check the states public records that proved that their property's septic tank had yet to be cleaned for the past 10 years despite the legal requirement. Since this timely septic issue affected every toilet in the house and wasnt resolved, they hired a personal handyman to clean the tank and communicated so. The property management was then responsive, asking for reimbursment for not only \"tampering\" with the septic tank, but for \"tampons\" that apparently clogged the tank despite never actually investigating the issue. After moving, the management continues to contact the family about owing money for the carpet, despite already paying the usual carpet cleaning fee. They are putting a single mother in dept.

In the 9 plus years of renting from this company they raised rent at every single opportunity they had. Since they fancy themselves as a \"virtual company \" they can be extremely difficult to reach or speak with in person. They also will force you to participate in several rental programs such as a furnace filter delivery services and others at a monthly expense to you on top of rent. Fair warning if you have pets you will be required to register them through one of their many 3rd party apps you are required to use at a cost to you upon every lease renewal date. You will also be subject to home inspections every 6 months. You will be given a time and date which is non negotiable because there schedule is just so busy. This company is definitely only interested in profiting as much as possible while doing as little as possible in the way of customer service.

I chose today at 1:30pm\n\nI just received an email saying I was confirmed for another date and time that is 3 days beyond what I chose. The email didnt reference our appointment today.\n\nThere seems to be a lapse in communication and a lack of desire to make good on situations with prospective tenants.\n\nVery disappointed with the lack of ownership and responsibility of this company.\n\nIntegrity and honesty are my core values so when something isnt aligned with that, the universe does its job and spins people and companies out of my orbit. This seems to be one of those times.\n\nMay this review be helpful for those who need to see it.

Then the lease had fee upon fee which most just said \"going rate\" so to rekey 1 door cost 97 dollars I soon found out... 45 dollar benefits package that is no benefit just more money in their pockets. Also they do follow guidelines and laws sure, upped our rent 800dollars as soon as they could after covid restrictions were lifted, there's no limit on raising amounts in wa state and clearly they enjoy that law!! When I spoke to the owner about the lease and all these new things I didn't sign up for with remax she gave me the run around and when I moved out we paid all of the fees.. But I know of same discussions with other tenants where their lease got changed and those fees would not apply so not sure what made them special... I understand their are bad tenants and landlords get ripped off at times but it's really sad when good tenants then have to pay for it..",

I had appliances break (dishwashers) in each apartment. They were replaced promptly and it was not taken out of my deposit. They were lenient and charged no fee for the one time we were late paying rent. It was only a day late, but still.  I got my full deposit back (minus like $10) from each house. The key is to remember the details; windows and sills, behind appliances, inside cabinets, etc. They give you a list, it's super easy. \n\nThe two problems I ever had both involved the parking lot. 1) SonRise will never call a tow-truck company to move cars without passes. 2) When it snows they do not shovel and only sometimes salt. If you plan on living in one of their units take some initiative and sweep/shovel your own stairs and walk ways and move your cars to street parking when the flakes start falling if you want to get out the next morning.",

We understand that humans are imperfect, and that we all are trying our best, but we want to warn the rest of the Bellingham community to stay away from Son-Rise.***\n\nThis was the worst experience I've ever had at a property management. My husband and I applied for a house with Son-Rise, along with one of our friends as a roommate. After 3 days of silence post submission of our applications, we reached out only to hear that we had \"missing items\" from our application. (This struck me as unprofessional, and awkward seeing that I was the one who had to seek THEM out to hear what I was missing versus the other way around.) Two days after we retrieved the missing items from our application, (items weren't even really missing, just lost in their emails) I called them back to see what our status was (since I didn't ever get a call from them) and found out there was yet ANOTHER item we were \"missing.\" Twice I had to reach out to find what we owed. Twice they were vague about the items we needed to complete this process. After two more weeks of playing tag with this property management, we found out we needed a co-signer. After we sent in the application for the co-signer, they reached out (FINALLY) saying we needed to track down our rental reference, because they themselves couldn't get ahold of them. It has been another week since we got all of the loose ends tied up, and we still have not heard back from Son-Rise about the property. Not only was our time and money wasted, it was unappreciated. Such an awful experience with a property manager who couldn't care less about the livelihood of future tenants.",

She is horrible at her job and should be removed from her position immediately. She takes sides in neighbor disputes and is the most condescending and rude a hole I have ever had the misfortune of speaking with. The way that she speaks to people (and I am one of four other people who have said similar things about her) is never okay in any situation, but as someone who works for the owners of the condo she should definitely not be rude to owners. If you ask her a question, she acts like the whole world is falling apart and speaks to you like you're a child. Selling the condo was the best thing I ever did, and I celebrate never having to look at her or speak to her again. Cheers!!",

I have rented at places in Miami, Los Angeles, Laguna Beach and Scottsdale which all are high well educated places. Ever since I started renting from this company it's been nothing but a hassle first week of renting their asked to up my rent because they had made a mistake on the price and asked for more money? Then I had signed a six-month lease with the option to renew for another year after living here for 60 days they had told me the owner is selling the place and I will not be able to re-sign my lease for another year. And then as a renter it is my job to maintain the yard as in no trash don't make it look sloppy if my grass is a little too long that's my opinion and I have got asked to cut the grass for the realtor to stage photos which I will be leaving in 10 days and I'm traveling in those 10 days while trying to move there telling me if I don't they're taking it out of my damage deposit which isn't right. I have a life and my life isn't mowing the grass if it's too long as a realtor or management company that's their responsibility they think it's out of control.  There all under graduated people working there that I don't think know what they're talking about and their guessing they're rude not respectful people.

        "review": "Lived in one of their brand new houses for a total of 2 years. As for bothering tenants they are fine, barely interacted with us. Yet the company is extremely unprofessional. To start, we were told when moving in \"We installed wood chips so that yard work will not be involved with the house\" then later received a notification that we needed to remove weeds that were growing. Glad they gave us an unusable heinous yard yet still expected us to maintain it like it was grass. They did inform us 24 hours in advance of yearly inspection, but they never informed us when the owner would randomly show up. A few times the owner would show up at our door without giving us any prior knowledge and inform us he was there to replace a filter or something (we always let him in because the owner is actually a super awesome guy, son-rise is the problem). We also informed them that our glass chandelier broke when our tall roommate hit it with his head, they never helped us fix or replace it, yet charged us at the end. We told them we were moving out 3 months before the end of the lease, which they forgot about until we had to remind them 10 days before our move-out. Now for the real KICKER: we put a couple thousand dollars down in the deposit. When we moved out we asked them when we would receive it. They said \"we have 21 days until we have to send it\". A month later I asked where it was and there response was \"Since no one informed us of an address to send it to, we mailed it to the house you leased from us.\" YES! Son-rise mailed an extremely valuable check to a VACANT house which is up for rent even though they have permanent addresses from the 3 people on the lease. Communicating with this company slightly feels like you are talking to a kindergarten class. Nice in person but I swear to god, behind closed doors they are as chaotic as a propane factory hosting a fireball juggling tournament.

We mowed our lawn every few weeks but they kept charging us as if they had to pay someone for lawn service. When we moved out we cleaned the house and garage way better than it was before we moved in. They charged us for 12 hours of 'cleaning', batteries, carpet cleaning (there was one room with carpet) and other random fees I've never experienced before. We made sure all batteries and lights worked before we left, and We scrubbed that housed. I called them and they were extremely rude, told me they couldn't do a walk through with us because someone else had moved in already. And then hung up on me. Very Christ like.

When I informed them that the house had mold (our lease said that they would take care of mold) they kept telling me that it probably wasn't mold and I was just confused about what mold looked like. If you do rent from them be sure to well document everything and get things in writing, especially if you are younger since they seem to see that as an opportunity to take advantage of you. \nMight be helpful:\nhttp://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights",

        "review": "I really  wanted to like Son-Rise. I loved the apartment, and the service was great when we were signing our lease but the past months have completely changed my perspective. As we prepared to move out we began to find out about all the extra fees and cleaning charges they require you to pay (even if you leave your apartment spotless). This would have been fine if they had been outright about it from the start but all we got was sweet talking and patronizing lectures. They have truly been quite rude to us. Basically, this is just another one of those realty companies that does whatever possible to take money from defenseless tenants. When  we finally moved out they ended up charging us for the time the apartment was vacant even though we had specifically asked them if they would only charge us to the day we vacated. Again, all I ask is that you say things outright and not twist legal language to your profit, is that too much to ask. These are sleazy untrustworthy people, don't do business with them.",

The company doesn't have enough employees to take care of apartment problems. One agent forgot to respond for a whole year. Son-Rise runs on a shoe-string budget, if you make the mistake to rent from the company don't expect much in return for the high rents charged. I'm not a university student but I think that's their attitude about everyone. The web site is pretty words but some of it's claims are false in my direct experience. They didn't always screen applicants for the best of renters, believe me.",

I'm assuming it took them this long because they hired people who would work for cheap and acted completely unprofessional, not giving my roommate and i proper amounts of time before they entered our apartment. They have left multiple notes on our doors telling us how much money the leak has cost them yet the only reason it cost as much as it did is because they did not maintain the plumbing system previous to the leak.",

Also, the toilet ran the whole year.  The dryer was taking longer and longer to dry clothes, up to 3 hours by the time I moved out.  Asked them for 6 months to fix it.  The dishwasher detergent dispenser didn't work.  Even though they wouldn't fix anything, they certainly have alot of rules for their tenants to follow.    In general just a frustrating experience.",

        "review": "Renter beware. My wife and I just finished renting from Son-Rise in August. We had nothing but issues in our dealings with this rental company. I can provide proof for nearly all of my issues below. \nHere is why I would steer clear of Son-Rise:\n- Unit was never cleaned prior to moving in\n- Water stains on floor of unit had not been fixed as I was told they had been\n- Dishwasher never worked properly\n- Numerous light bulbs were burned out when I moved in\n- Fixing my hot water heater took 3 visits from two different maintenance men\n- A bullet hole that occurred in my wall was never repaired. At first I was told it would be my cost to fix as it was not a result of the units owner. When I pressed the issue, Son-Rise agreed to fix it at their cost. It was never repaired while I lived in the unit.\n- Upon terminating my lease (admittedly late, but only by three days) I was responsible for September's rent (moved out in August). Within the rights of Washington Landlord-Tenant law.\n- Paid September rent knowing our unit had been viewed by multiple people and an application had been submitted prior to the end of August.\n- Was never informed when a new lease was signed (When a new lease is signed, I would be due a prorated amount of September's rent).\n- I found out a new renter was in the unit when I contacted the energy company to arrange my last bill.\n- I was only refunded rent when I contacted Son-Rise and pressed the issue about the rent as well as some absurd charges made on my deposit (fire alarm batteries for $45?)\n-Oh, beware of the automatic $25 taken out of your deposit as \"Administrative Fee\"\n\nSome other items to be warned about are the poorly written lease (several sections seem to say one thing, but Son-Rise interprets them another). The company overworks their employees (in my opinion) and this slows down all action on maintenance requests outside of legally required responses (so water/electric/heat) as well as any inquiries. I could continue, but would begin entering my personal feelings and not fact. The only reason that I gave Son-Rise two stars is that the rent was easily cheaper by $100 a month than elsewhere and that they did end up refunding the rent due to me in addition to most of the charges to my deposit (and I still contend they owe me all but the $25, but getting that would cost me a lawyer and that costs more than the other charges)",

We are licensed and bonded just to note. On the phone to the front desk lady I was calling in my plumbing issue and asked ya know \"hey I work at Gary's Plumbing and Heating and is there anyway...\" Didn't even get to finish my sentence before she cut me off and said \"they have to be licensed and bonded\" and I said \"Oh of course they are..\" cut off again I got to hear \"Um yea, so no\". Rude much? And when she asked is it okay for us to enter your home while you're not there and I said no, I'd would like to be there, she almost sounded like \"well.....okaaaaay\". Yes, well okay...do not enter my home without my permission while I am not there. End of story. So now I'm a little apprehensive whether they will actually follow what I asked and hope I don't show up from work to see someone I don't know in my house.",
