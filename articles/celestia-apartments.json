Of course with any new apartment, things are already chipping off like the cheap paint on the back door and interior doors. But regardless, we love our place and being near the park and everything else! We have enjoyed the community space upstairs, too!",

        "review": "We moved in early September 2024. Tim and Payton provided prompt and courteous service. We scheduled a tour and Tim followed up with us in the morning for our scheduled tour. During application process and lease signing, Tim was quick to respond and also followed up for any questions. It was quick and smooth process with user friendly system. Management does a great job, and building is new and in good shape. It is a quiet place and is close to all amenities. It is located next to Cordata park - with walking trails, pickleball and basketball court and nice play area for kids. An ideal place.",
