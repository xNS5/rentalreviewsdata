        "review": "We lived at Barkley for two years, and it was the best apartment experience we've had. Maintenance was always taken care of promptly, the property management team is friendly and helpful, and the neighbors are decent.\n\nBeing able to move in with an alternative to a traditional deposit was very helpful at that time, and upon move out they didn't nickel and dime us for things and were helpful/understanding throughout the move out process. While we were tenants, we were also able to utilize Flex payments and pay rent in two payments, which was very helpful. \n\nThe apartments themselves are nice, and a far cry from the college apartments on the other side of town. Our unit overlooked a green belt on our back side, which was our favorite part. It made it feel like we weren't smack in the middle of town, with all of the convenience of being right smack in the middle of town.\n\nIf we ever have to move back into an apartment, I would absolutely want it to be Barkley.",

        "review": "My experience closely matches Gretchen F.  By the time I moved in Sept 2017, the aforementioned property managers were gone and we had some nice ladies, Kathryn and Anne.  Kathryn was very understanding and would work with us within the limited scope she was able.  Anne was very very strict and by the books but fair in my opinion.  The owner is a company called Coast Management based out of Seattle. \n\nI initially rented a 750 sq ft 2 bed 2 bath with W/D, pet rent, utilities and a reserved parking spot for $1244/mo. It was a first floor middle unit with a nice view of the \"woods.\"  \n\nDeer would walk right past the giant glass sliding door and porch. They are cute, BUT deer are flea infested pests... so the first month we were there we had flea problems until we figured out we cannot open the back door and let the dogs enjoy the porch.  \n\nAfter the flea debacle we found out that the interior master bathroom had a serious mold problem.  No blame in the property managers the building design and position does not allow good air flow. As soon  as we found out they relocated us and sent in a professional for remediation. \n\nMoral of this story is to look at an apartment before you rent.\n\nWe stayed two years. It is not a bad place or a bad property management co.   When we left our 2 bedroom, 2 bath, with covered parking, dog rent and utilities would have been $1675 total...  I moved to Beverly Hills CA and found something comparable for $1900...  \n\nThe bad: It is getting expensive and not worth the quality or sustainable for the average salary in Bellingham. No one picks up their dog poop.  This is a Bellingham problem not just a Barkley problem.  Since this is like the only apartment complex that rents to people with dogs, the common grass areas smell like a kennel... it's not exactly a nice green space your kids can play in. \n\nThe good: They are renovating and updating everything.  The neighbors were all nice.  There were only a few bad owners with poorly trained/socialized dogs. The location is very convenient to stores, entertainment, bus lines, and hwys.",

        "review": "I moved from Buffalo, NY to Bellingham in August 2017 for a new job with just three weeks notice. Trying to find a pet friendly apartment within my budget in such a short time frame was not an easy task and I had to take what was available - that was at Barkley Trails. Cannot believe how expensive the rent is for the size of the apartment...$1150 + $25 water + $25 pet rent for a 622 sq. ft. one bedroom - it was literally the only thing they had available. It's in a convenient location (one mile from my job), it had a washer/dryer, and a dishwasher. Okay, should be fine...\n\nWhat a ripoff. As others have mentioned, forget coming home late. Even reserved parking spots may not be near your apartment. Half of the parking spots are normal sized (thankfully I could usually snag one of these) and half of them are so tiny I could barely squeeze out of my compact car! The dryer never worked completely, everything had to be run through twice. I suspect the outside vent needs to be cleaned. The two baseboard heaters were the least efficient heating elements I've ever experienced - and expensive! I could not believe the cost of my electric bills over the winter! \n\nI freely admit, my rent was late three time during my lease. I had some car issues that were very costly. However, my rent was always paid by the following paycheck, in full, with late fees. They make things extra confusing by leaving two notices stapled together on your door. One says you have three days to pay, one says ten days. It wasn't until the very last one that I discovered the three days is to pay the base rent ($1125) and the ten days is to pay the other charges and late fees. I received notice at the end of June that they were electing not to renew my lease beginning in August - not an eviction, just choosing not to renew.\n\nI just received my \"refund\" on my security deposit and refundable pet fee ($350 of the pet fees are refundable, $150 is non-refundable). They kept $120 of the security deposit to cover \"lightly sanitizing\" the floors! What the heck?! I'm assuming this is because of my pet, but anywhere else I've lived, that is the entire purpose of the non-refundable pet fee: to cover the cleanings associated after moveout. What a joke. \n\nShould also mention that despite the lease stating that you can't leave garbage outside the front doors or smoke on your balcony, neither of these things are enforced. My neighbors routinely left multiple bags of garbage outside their door for days at a time, attracting many bugs. People also smoke everywhere, to the point where it was a nuisance to open the windows in my living area. \n\nI am so relieved to be out of that place. I've found a beautiful condo to rent directly from the owner, with no extra pet fees and a reserved parking space steps from the entrance of the condo. Two bedrooms and it's $100 cheaper per month than the Barkley Apartments! \n\nI will gladly take part in any communication with the Attorney General as others have mentioned. It seems management staff changed again about halfway through my lease and the new people were even worse than the previous ones.",

        "review": "in our current climate of change posting this is the best activism available for renters as the laws are bent for the landlords.\n\nWe lived at Barkley Trails for 6 years. The first four was not bad. (last two years had to do with bad upstairs tenants). In September 2016 management changed. The person who reviewed the current management is correct. They are young, arrogant, entitled, rude, condescending. biased, insensitive and fraudulent. Their boss is Jeannie Torchia torchia@coastmgt.com (425) 405-1340 . The manager, Lauren Kennedy blatantly lied about our move out. I have filed complaints with the Attorney General. This was to keep a public record of their practices. Do not expect justice from them, but move on and have your justice in finding a better place to live. **note: previous manager Amanda was at least fair. Amanda told me directly we would have all our deposit returned because we had been there so long. Lauren Kennedy tacked on fees to \"sand\" the nail patches in each room. I am meticulous and know they did not need sanding. I honored the lease, filling the holes as required by the lease. She was looking for reasons to hold back deposits. She charged us for a blind we had them in to fix that they couldn't fix. They claimed something was broken and had to be replaced. If it were broken I would have reported it to them. After six years there was wear and tear as is expected in long term living, but nothing out of the ordinary. When Coast management bought the property they used our apartment to help sell it because of the way I had it decorated and kept it. I know Lauren Kennedy fraudulently withheld most of our deposit. Report every little thing in writing. Coast Management also own Brampton Apartments in Bellingham, WA. One thing they do, if you are not section 8, is lie at your move out to hold back your deposit to make up the losses with the section 8 renters. They also tried to get approval to charge for water and sewer independently of the rent but the county denied this because of all the section 8 tenants they have there. They owe me money. No two ways about it. It is a debt that will go unpaid.  Keep records and diaries. Resist minimizing and avoid \"benefit of the doubt\" with these landlords. Report it all in writing. Again:  Jeannie Torchia torchia@coastmgt.com (425) 405-1340",

        "review": "After reading the previous reviews I 1000% agree with them. Starting with we weren't given a paper copy of the lease. Origionally i was told it was emailed to me but since I never got it, she had me sign on the computer in the office, and was told they'd get it to us. We constantly had to have maintenance called for repairs, our dryer (needed to be ran 3-4 times to dry) took them 3 times to come \"fix\" and we gave up asking. We had toilet issues that were reported from the day we moved in until a month before we moved out, again never fixed.\nSomeone before us had painted the walls different colors and the patch jobs done were terrible, we got wall art to cover it all up. Yet they claim they repaint the whole apartment between renters. \n Open parking is terrible if you come home late, we paid the extra money for reserved spaces after one night of waiting 45 min to find a spot not even near our building. When people parked in our paid spots they left it up to us to find out who the car owners were. \n  We complained about birds in the vents in Febuary which caused noise super early in the mornings, we were told they clean them out every August and would just have to wait. We spent the last day of our lease cleaning the apartment. We left it clean as opposed to when we moved in and found trash on the floors, dirty counters/floors/refrigerator/oven. Yet we still got charged $135 for cleaning because a fly was found in the window and some of the blinds were dirty in spite of the fact the blinds needed replacing. When we turned our stuff in she was brushing us off so she could talk to the maintenance guys and didn't do our final walk through with us. Yet when we asked about why were being charged the amount for cleaning she asked why we didn't do the walk through with her. We reminded her that we tried notifying her about the disuse when we turned in the keys and parking passes but she was too busy to deal with us and kept saying all that stuff is just routine repairs, it's not big deal. \n\n$300 dollars of our deposit wasn't consideredrefundable we understand that, yet they held back more than they should have for an absurd reason. It's incredibly frustrating when you're given the run around for no reason, and when you're mis-led by the staff. In the end we were told we can't dispute the charges because they already cut us a check and it's final. Never mind the only way for us to know the charges was to get the check. \n\nOther than that stuff, the neighbors were decent, but the dog owners were terrible about picking up the poop.  We needed a place to live and didn't have much time to find one so we landed here. If we ever rent again, we will research better, but it won't be with this company.",

        "review": "I pay $1272.00 for a 2 bedroom apartment and I cannot wait to move, these are the worst apartments I've ever lived in. The staff is rude and incompetent and totally apathetic when you call with any issues. There are 2 maintenance people; cheaper apartments in town have 5 generally. They don't keep the property well maintained. Our car was stolen, it was broken into twice. The Barkley neighborhood sucks and people moving here need to know that, because the managers will tell you how safe and nice it is. I loathe this place and am super looking forward to moving out.",

        "review": "Thank you, Laine W. I agree with every word you posted! When we moved out at the end of April 2017,  we left the apartment cleaner than the first day we moved in. I was expecting to get all of my deposit back but they held $75.00 because of dirt in the window tracks! The window tracks were cleaned with a vacuum and small brush. Unfortunately for Barkley, I have pictures. You can use my name if the Attorney General should contact you! I have many complaints which I brought to Lauren's attention and also had to contact Jeannie Torchia because of Lauren Kennedy condescending attitude!",

        "review": "Beware, of being seduced into thinking these are well built apartments. Built in 2002, so you might think that the noise level between upper and lower apartments isn't going to be so annoying. It is annoying, and in general will sound like an elephant is above you. If you have noisy neighbors below you that fight or argue, you will hear it even through the carpeting and floor. The refrigerator/freezers are terrible. Very small freezer space and if you fill it, you will have problems. \n\nYour lease is going to be very long, over 10 pages (get a lawyer to review it), and there are many unfair conditions. When the time comes to move out, you will have management bringing \"god knows who\" into your apartment up to 20 days before you leave with only 24 hour notice, whether you are there or not.  \n\nIf you don't want to be in buildings with pets (thus fleas), they will tell you that there is another building that doesn't allow pets. You might want to rent there: beware they don't tell you that they allow any person who claims a disability to have a pet in that building, so there could still be fleas. \n\nThey say no smoking is allowed in or near apartments, but they allow smoking near the balconies, so if smoke bothers you don't plan on having your non-air conditioned apartment windows open during hot summer. After your lease is over if you want to stay on month to month your rent could go up by almost $200/month. They want to move people in and out; can you guess why?\n\nThe nicest thing about this place is being able to hear frogs in the spring if you are in an apartment on the backside by the woods. You'll spend a lot more for heat on this side. If you end up on a ground floor, you'll never be able to open your windows, as anyone can park in front of your apartment and at night the car lights will shine in.",
