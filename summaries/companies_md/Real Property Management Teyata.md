# Real Property Management Teyata: A Comprehensive Review

## Good
Real Property Management Teyata appears to be a company that shines in many aspects, as reflected in their high average review score. Clients have repeatedly praised the company for its responsive staff, who are often described as helpful, attentive, and professional. From the user reviews, there is a recurring theme of employees going above and beyond to address tenant issues promptly, whether it's assisting with lockouts or addressing maintenance needs swiftly. One user recalled an instance where the company managed to avoid locksmith fees for them, serving as a testament to their dedication and customer service.

Other reviews laud the hands-on approach of property managers like Kellie and Logan, emphasizing their attention to both tenant and owner needs. A number of landlords highlighted the team's excellent management of multiple rental units, indicating that the company can handle a significant portfolio with care and efficiency. Specifically, property owners seem to appreciate the thorough tenant screening process and the professional handling of leasing transactions. They have earned recommendations for the competency in managing investment properties and have been characterized as a "one-stop shop" for real estate solutions.

## Great
The greatness of Real Property Management Teyata comes through in several user reviews celebrating individual team members. For instance, staff members like Kellie Strong and Lawton Coursey have consistently received accolades for their ethic, customer service, and high level of expertise in property management. Their knowledge about the real estate market, timely communication, and the ability to provide informative virtual tours have been particularly noted and appreciated by clients.

Additionally, property owners and investors have expressed high satisfaction with the company's services, endorsing their professionalism and efficacy. The staff's willingness to educate clients on all aspects of property management has been praised, and their adeptness at problem-solving comes through clearly in user testimonials. This attention to client education and transparency helps landlords feel at ease, knowing that their properties are in knowledgeable hands. The responsiveness and the company's ability to achieve target rent amounts, while ensuring tenant satisfaction, have spoken to their excellence in the field.

## Bad
Despite a majority of positive feedback, some user reviews indicate areas where Real Property Management Teyata could improve. Some tenants have reported periods of unanswered calls and texts, particularly after initial periods of exemplary service. This fall in responsiveness seems to have led to frustration over maintenance and repair requests going unresolved for extended periods. A critical recount involves a broken dishwasher that was not dealt with until after the tenant vacated, indicative of a lapse in the maintenance follow-up process.

The issue of poor communication has been a pain point for some renters and property owners alike. A few have described the company as unresponsive, with significant communication breakdowns. Such experiences have adversely impacted client satisfaction, demonstrating that the company occasionally struggles to maintain the high service standard set by its more positive reviews. This inconsistency in service, especially related to follow-through on reported issues, suggests room for growth in client relations and service delivery.

## Ugly
A fraction of the user reviews showcase some alarming experiences with Real Property Management Teyata. The most serious accusations include lying, enabling landlords to breach laws, and attempting to exploit clients. One alarming case references a lack of action regarding known issues with mold in a property, which can pose severe health risks. Moreover, there are allegations of the company breaching agreements, failing to pay out funds and security deposits, highlighting severe discrepancies in financial management and client trust.

Such allegations, if true, would signify a serious breach of professional standards and could cause considerable harm to Real Property Management Teyataâ€™s reputation. Though these are isolated user reviews within the context of an overall high average rating, they serve as potential red flags that prospective clients might want to investigate further. The company's response (or lack thereof) to these accusations in user reviews also leaves much to be desired, indicating a need to strengthen their crisis management and customer relations strategy.
