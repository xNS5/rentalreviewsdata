        "review": "I was a resident of the Foothills property for 3 years, during which I had many unfortunate interactions with the Royce Group management. I was targeted for a few dead plants at the end of season while allowing other properties to look disorderly with no resolution. I believe this was largely based on my age (in my 60s). They aggressively targeted me for things that were not even my property without asking like a civilized adult. They assumed that a TV left in the parking area was mine and threatened to fine me for its disposal. At the time, I didnt even own a TV.\nThey Impounded my car and lied about it. Despite knowing exactly where I lived, they placed a sticker on my car facing away from where it would be easily noticeable over the weekend. When confronted they said that it was towed because it was inoperable (a lie as I had driven it out of impound). They then tried to lie saying it was because the tabs were expired (also NOT the case). They did not make any attempt to call me, knock on my door, or show any good faith attempt to resolve the issue before towing. Only reason I did not sue was because my daughter found a technicality in the lease stating that they could do that if the vehicle had any disrepair ( one of my windows did not roll up all the way and my bumper had some tape on it). All of this while allowing multiple other vehicles to remain on the property without having been moved for months. This was definitely an act of aggression based on impoverished appearances. They show disdain for people of lower income. Despite that, they themselves do not keep up their own property.\nFailure to light pathways caused me to fall showing that they did not care about the safety of their tenants  as well as car damaging pot holes that they were informed of multiple times and did nothing for the entire duration of my tenancy. They continuously raised the rent despite not investing it in making their property a nice place to live for the price. They also offered a swimming pool in their advertisement which remained empty for the majority of my tenancy then was filled in with dirt (false advertising amenities). The maintenance staff were incredibly courteous and went out of their way to help. They deserve more professional employers. The dwelling itself was alright, nice storage. The place has a lot of potential to be very nice if it werent for the deplorable behaviors of their management team.",

        "review": "I have a good friend who has lived at the Foothills for 10 years. She is nearly 70 years old and has a 34 year old mentally ill son she cares for 24 hours a day. He has schizophrenia and sometimes talks out loud to the voices in his head. He is a sweet young man when stabilized and totally harmless. A new neighbor heard him carrying on a conversation with himself and got frightened. She complained to the office and they are now in the process of being evicted.\nLast October, her upstairs hot water heater exploded and flooded the upstairs bathroom and the kitchen on lower level. There is no flooring or sink in upstairs bathroom, and no kitchen sink, cupboards, or counter in the kitchen. They provided her a small wash basin to do dishes. She has continued to pay rent and continued living in these terrible conditions for 5 months.\nShe is soon to be homeless, as she can not find a place to rent. This entire situation is atrocious and should be illegal.",

        "review": "The foothills apartments give me dirty crack den vibes. I've been living here for the past year with my significant other and we're ACTIVELY trying to find anywhere else to live but what I can call the lowest end dumps in the deepest depths of hell itself. We pay 915 for a one bedroom but come a few months from now, our place will be 1050 a month. We have walls so thin I doubt paper would be a good analogy for how gaunt the walls are. We don't have any sort of dishwasher in our place and we have disruptive neighbors who play piano at odd hours and take long noisy showers also at odd hours. Our bedroom and living room will be freezing cold if we don't keep our heaters on at all hours of the day, that jacks up our electric bill quite a bit as well. The pot holes are atrocious and I'm sure they keep f'ing up the brakes of our vehicle. They claim to have a swimming pool but it's always covered and actually FILLED WITH DIRT. So, they lie, we have a leak in the ceiling and I have called the royce group about it but they haven't called back or tried to send a maintenance guy over to patch it up. The water here goes cold within minutes so you better like taking speedy showers. Oh, and our power just shuts off because the breakers get overloaded by a lamp. Most of the switches and outlets are dead in our apartment so getting things to power up is scarce to say the least. They also overcharged us to move in. 915 a month for rent but I paid nearly 3200 bucks to get a place here. Quite a rip-off and I'm concerned I'll be not able to move out since I'm straddling the poverty line. I cannot recommend these dirt bags to anyone. Hope I don't get evicted for this review!",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite its drawbacks, some residents find aspects of living at Foothills Apartments to be satisfactory. Several users highlighted friendly neighbors and the general quietness of the area. Additionally, there are positive remarks about the peacefulness due to the location, with some describing it as a tranquil environment where one can enjoy the surroundings. While not extremely luxurious, the apartments offer some basic amenities that are appreciated, such as the pet-friendly policy allowing dogs older than one year, which is a significant plus for animal lovers.</p><p>Another commendable aspect is the maintenance team, which is often praised for their courteous attitude and dedication. Multiple users acknowledge that the maintenance staff goes above and beyond to ensure tenants' needs are met, though their efforts are sometimes overshadowed by management issues. A few tenants noted the complex has potential to be improved, hinting that management's focus on enhancing living conditions could lead to a more satisfying experience, as the apartments themselves provide adequate storage space and have a certain charm that residents appreciate.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>Although user reviews are largely negative, a handful stand out for expressing a significantly positive experience at Foothills Apartments. Residents have described the complex as \"cute\" and \"elegant\", indicating their satisfaction with the aesthetic appeal and atmosphere of the property. Some appreciate the sense of community, finding comfort in the interactions with neighbors and delight in the welcoming environment.</p><p>Another strong point is the property's convenience, particularly for those who value proximity to local amenities despite being nestled away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Reviews applaudit for offering a peaceful retreat that is still accessible. For these tenants, the combination of location, charm, and community feel contributes to a pleasant living experience that surpasses their expectations, making Foothills an understated gem in their eyes.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Recurring frustrations among residents include the significantly high rent increases that do not correspond with improvements in amenities or living conditions. Many reviews express dissatisfaction with the outdated facilities, pointing out the lack of modern conveniences like dishwashers and the ineffective heating systems. The thin walls leading to constant noise disturbances are a common irritant for tenants, contributing to discomfort and frustration.</p><p>A frequent complaint involves the state of disrepair across the property, notably the potholes in the parking areas which are left unaddressed despite multiple reports to management. The once-promised swimming pool now filled with dirt is another sore point, leading to claims of false advertising by the management. These issues highlight a disconnect between rental rates and the level of service and maintenance provided, leading residents to question their continued stay at the complex.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most alarming reports about Foothills Apartments involve accusations of discriminatory practices and severe neglect of essential repairs. One user described an eviction process seemingly influenced by bias, while another shared a troubling account of living without necessary facilities for an extended period following a water damage incident, despite the continuous payment of rent. Additionally, there are claims of a hostile management environment, particularly for individuals perceived to have lower income.</p><p>Safety concerns also arise from experiences like theft and inadequate lighting leading to dangerous falls. Multiple reviews highlight a shocking disregard for tenant welfare, such as stickered vehicles towed without proper notice and unresolved hazardous conditions within apartments. The combination of these aggressive management practices and ignored maintenance requests leaves some tenants feeling disrespected and vulnerable, painting a grim picture of the property's administrative leadership and overall habitability.</p></section>"
