        "review": "We moved into the Park View Village Apartments sight unseen and Cheryl the property manager was so helpful and easy to communicate with.  She sent us videos of multiple units for us to choose between to best suit our needs prior to making our final decision.  She is by far the best property manager we've had the pleasure of leasing from.  Would recommend the property to others as not only are the apartment and community amenities great so is the management and service.   Cheryl and Alex are very responsive to work orders and get requests handled in a timely manner.  The apartment has a trail right behind it that leads to a park, which is great if you have pets or enjoy being outdoors.  If you are looking for an apartment to lease then look no further this is the spot for you.",

Alex is super quick and friendly when we put in work orders. The whole complex is quiet and friendly. We are close enough to everything to still feel like we live in town while being more secluded. 1000/10 recommendation if your looking at living here.",

It's has sucurd front doors ( you have to be buzzed in by someone that lives there or have your own key to unlock the doors)  once inside you come to find yourself in a upscale lobbie with very pleasant decorations and different seating options and arraignments.",
