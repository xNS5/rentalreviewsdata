He is the owner of Evergreen Property Management and strives to make his tenants happy and comfortable in their rental.\nHe is very kind, and really does care about your needs or concerns.\nIf he is ever running late to come fix something, he will always keep in touch.\nShana, who also works for him is also very kind and helpful.\nThis is honestly a great company, so if any doubts, just let them go.\nYou will always be cared for by Casey and Shana.",

        "review": "Evergreen Properties NW has been a DREAM to rent from and deal with as a tenant!  I had a bad taste in my mouth from other property management companies but Casey and his staff took that away from Day 1.  The very few times Ive needed maintenance, I never had to wait and it was taken care of asap.  Not only that, Casey & staff have gone above and beyond a few times when they didnt have to - ALWAYS with a smile, too. Evergreen Properties NW is a breath of fresh air when most companies these days have forgotten what good customer service is!  I will rent from them as long as I need to, for sure. I highly recommend them if youre looking to rent.",

        "review": "We rented from Evergreen Properties NW for approximately 5 years. We were in the unit for 6 years, but it was managed by another company for the first year or so. We are VERY glad that Evergreen Properties NW took over because from then on, everything was much smoother and the staff was much nicer. I suggest calling the office with questions or concerns, as they are more likely to answer the phone or call back instead of email. Casey is very kind and reasonable to work with. He did a great job with maintenance, but there was sometimes a delay in response. We moved out of state, otherwise we likely would have stayed until we saved enough to purchase a home!",

        "review": "Just took over a lease and the whole process was super easy. This is by far the most ethical property management company in the area. Casey specifically is very helpful and responds very quickly with any questions that you may have . Overall very happy with the moving in process.\n\n7/21/20 Almost two years later and this has been a fantastic management company to deal with. Our lease ends next month and we are moving into another place that is also managed by Evergreen. Lara has been beyond helpful as well as Casey. If you plan on renting in Bellingham, I would heavily consider using Evergreen. Nothing beats them!",

Casey works hard, however, unfortunately, he has abysmal staff who do not communicate with the tenant or with Casey appropriately.\n\nBetween rude and unprofessional text messages received by me from his assistant to clear miscommunication between Casey and his assistant, staff alone lost Casey a top review. Id lower it further if Casey were not a joy to work with.\n\nCasey, you run a strong business. I wish you every success and I hope you can find staff that match your dedication, kindness, and responsibility.",

        "review": "This was my experience with Casey and the group which was awful to say the least.\n\n- Casey was over an hour and a half late to the initial meeting to view the house.\n-The lease he sent over was full of errors.\n-Upon showing up to move in, the house was not cleaned and had a hole in the drywall.  After 3 days, Casey brought in a cleaning crew.  The cleaning crew threw away everything in the refrigerator.  Casey laughed about the situation, saying I guess I should have walked through the house before you guys moved in.\n-The house needed numerous fixes, fireplace, sink leaking, and several other fixes.  For items, like the fireplace, he said he would call a local company to come fix it.  I called the local company to confirm Casey has called them, it did not.  It took 3 months to fix the initial items from move in.\n-The house I rented had a deck which I told Casey numerous time about.  Finally, one of the boards broke under me creating a huge safety hazard.  When I told Casey about this, he said he could not touch the house without the owners permission.  What is the point of managing a property if you can not maintain issues? Especially huge safety issues like a broken board on a 10 foot tall deck.  The issue was never fixed.\n-Lara and Casey always complain of being too busy.  Issues with the house took a long time to resolve.  When I moved out, I still had unresolved maintenance claims after 2 years.\n-This is a second job for Casey as he often bragged about doing construction with the owner.  Again, why he often forgets or issues take a long time to resolve.\n-I had to break my lease which I understand should have some fees associated with it.  They tried to charge me fees that were not in the lease.  It took weeks of arguing and requesting the clause in my lease before they finally did not charge me.\n-Would not allow a lease take over as it was not their policy anymore but could not provide written proof of this.  It is funny how a below review states someone just took over a lease.\n-Charged me for the month of rent for April for my lease break but was fired half way through April and did not refund the rent for the rest of the month.\n-Would not do a final walkthrough of the house upon move out.\n\nI could go on and on about how terrible of a company this is or how much Casey/ Lara does not care about their tenants.\n\nResponse: Ah, yes Casey.  Tenants that pay rent on time and leave the place better than they found it are clearly the ones to avoid.  I apologize for being difficult and making you fix things, like a property manager is supposed to do.  And no, you did not work hard, it took weeks to get a response from you.",

          "text": "Oh, Bryant. This review does not surprise me.    Im sorry you feel this way. However, You and your perpetually bitter girlfriend were quite difficult most of time. (Tenants we strive to avoid if I had to be completely honest)  I personally worked with you on many occasions while you were in the process of searching for a home and put up with your dishonestly and excuses the entire time...Sadly, no matter how hard we tried, you werent pleased.  Fortunately for us, you guys moved on.  Please call the office and ask for Casey should you have additional concerns.  Id love to discuss this with you in person.\n\nBest of luck to you both!"
