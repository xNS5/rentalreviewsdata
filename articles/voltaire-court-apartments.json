With only positive comments regarding both the property and the management company, this section does not have any specific detail of a negative resident experience to report as of this article's creation.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Similar to the \"Bad\" section, the lack of multiple reviews makes it difficult to form a comprehensive opinion on any \"ugly\" aspects of Voltaire Court Apartments. The user reviews do not contain references to neglected duties, unreturned security deposits, poor communication, or any severe issues that would warrant inclusion in this section. Therefore, at this time, the article does not feature any \"ugly\" elements related to the property management company or the apartment itself.</p></section>"
