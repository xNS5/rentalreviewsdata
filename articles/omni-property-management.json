        "review": "Ive been renting from Omni since mid December and have found them to be a great company. I read the few low ratings sitting at the top of their most recent (as any property management is bound to have) but felt happy to move forward and see a lease through.\n\nIm happy I have chosen Omni and so grateful for their amazing staff. I have found Jessica to be so extremely helpful and friendly. Shes truly a gem and it makes me happy to be renting from this company. They are on top of their response time to questions and concerns and have always gotten back to me promptly.\n\nI recently had been having my difficulties with my autopay and was given grace to be refunded for late fees so kudos to their understanding!\n\nAs someone in service industry it can be daunting to rent from a property management and prove income, but Omni (specifically Jessica) worked with me to find ways to provide proof of income which took a heap of stress off the process.",

          "text": "Jennieyz B, \nThere are often challenges during times of inclement weather. We do our best to address them in a timely manner and as vendors are available to do so. I am unsure which location you reside in but several of our properties have narrow driveways and/or parking lots which make it difficult to impossible to plow. Our priority in these situations is to address walkways and entry points first with hand shoveling and ice-melt application. When the snow and ice are only expected for 24-48 hours there is not always time or a need to go beyond basic remediation. \nIn contrast, the parking lot where our office is located has a large parking lot that is empty during non-business hours which allows for a plow to access it easily. (This is also a commercial complex of which we have no ownership or management of.)\nAs always your feedback is valuable and we appreciate your time in leaving this message. If you have further concerns we encourage you to reach out to us directly through our office. \nThank you, \nLacey, Owner and Operations Manager\nOMNI Property Management\n360-746-9613"

We had some mildly serious maintenance concerns that were addressed immediately, even at times when finding a contractor is hard.\n\nI feel like OMNI is above board and doing their best to be fair to both tenants and landlords , as well as following fair housing regulations and practices.

        "review": "I had an incredibly poor experience renting through Omni. Communication throughout our whole lease cycle was inconsistent and unprofessional. I loved the property I rented but if I hadn't been moving out of state I would have moved to a property managed by anyone else, without hesitation, and paid more to avoid the loopholes of an Omni leasing experience. I've rented from private landlords and other management companies in other areas and never felt as taken advantage of as I did by Omni. If you are considering renting with them I would highly advise you to consult the Washington State tenancy laws before you sign anything that will minimize your rights.",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "Corinne, \nWe are truly sorry that you felt that we were not consistent in our communication with you.  We make every effort to explain the lease agreement and requirements in a clear way as we understand that the legal wording required can be confusing. I see we went back and forth multiple times by email/text during this transaction. Roommate switches and lease changes can add to the confusion with so many parties involved.  Our hope is that if you feel there is something more we could have done you would reach out to us directly to try and rectify the situation. However, I understand that there is not always a completely satisfactory solution for all parties involved.  All leases have costs involved for certain items and we make best efforts to remind tenants what is written in their signed lease agreement as soon as these situations come up. \nWe hope that you have found a more satisfying living arrangement for yourself.\nBest Wishes, \nLacey Lutjemeier, Operations Manager\nOMNI Property Management LLC"

I waited three months and was never contacted. Finally I contacted OMNI days before rent was due to figure out how to pay them. I was told it was their busiest week of the year.\n\nWe were told rent would increase and six months before it happened they quoted us about a 20% increase. Then, two months before they doubled it to a 43% increase.\n\nWhen I asked if this was a mistake, I was told that 'the house could be rented for more if it were marketed today.'\n\nNice",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "We appriciate your feedback and we certainly understand that the rent increases in this area have been more difficult for some more than others.  \nI hate to have this converstaion in a public forum but this is how you have choosen to proceed. \nAs you noted you were give 6 month's advanced notice of the increase and ample opportunity to discuss the situation, sign the offered renewal and lock in the rate offered or find other accomidations. After much work on the home and changes in city requirements you were give 2 additional months at the same very low rate. We then again negotiated the offer for a discount for another 3 months. Even currently your rent is several hundred dollars lower than market rent. \nWhat many renters do not understand is that the cost of ownership has increased greatly over the past several years in Tax increases, Insruance increases and the cost of labor and materials to make repairs.  Taxes alone have increase around 30% over the past 3 years. And though this is not the case for you, many owners also lost month's of unrecoverable rent during Covid. Some even lost their property because they were unable to pay their mortgages. \nWe understand that rent increases can be challenging, and we want to assure you that we have made an effort to keep this adjustment reasonable. We value our tenants, and we are committed to providing them with a well-maintained and comfortable living environment.\nPlease feel free to contact us directly to continue this conversation in a private arena. \nSincerely,\nLacey Lutjemeier, \nOwner, Operation Manager\nOMNI Property Management"

Upon moving in we noticed the thermostats did not work, which means if you turned it on to a temperature the apartment would just continue to heat and would never shut off. We put in a work order to have them fixed, not only did they not fix it but the maintenance man told my girlfriend to Google how heat works. Lacy then took it upon herself to come to the unit and turn them on to prove a point. Basically we had on off switches for thermostats, on top of that they charged us $55 for the maintenance response.\nFast forward to month three of the lease, we paid rent on their website (the same site and card number that we had used the two months prior), Lacy calls us half way through the month to tell us that there was a $150 late fee for rent not being paid. Lacy could not give me a reason why it did not go through. She basically told me I had to pay $150 for a glitch in their system. After arguing with her for 20 minutes she finally told me to bring in a paper check that day only to wave the fee. We moved and are now seeing the charges for deposit.\nWe were charged 17 hours of labor for the unit Cleanup which is ridiculous, the pictures she sent us of our \"excessively dirty\" were straight up laughable. It was just some sweeping that needed to be done. So that means we don't get a deposit back. Ridiculous.\nI am extremely happy to be done with this property management company. Anyone thinking of renting with them I would just say beware.\n\nAlso, one of the 5 star rating is from a current employee, so that's misguiding and unprofessional.",

Although you aren't supposed to discriminate when it comes to housing, I also feel that you don't have to tolerate the bullsh!t from bad tenants wrecking a place.  I talked with Lacey L from Omni Property Management and explained that I wanted a win-win situation.  She was able to narrow down tenants who had responsible and courteous lifestyles (OMG, that actually exists!) and we have not had any problems.  Of course, I also did my part by checking out the units and making sure things were clean, working, and passed inspection.  I would also get my hands dirty and scrub, vacuum, and clean. Still...I might be able to change a lightbulb, but I'm no handyman.  Also, I've heard horror stories about tenants behaving badly, not paying rent, and then claiming they are the poor, helpless victims against the Evil Landlord (Lordy...grow up and save that drama for your next Oscar).  So, I don't have time for that.  I mean, really...how hard is it to pay one's rent on time, keep the noise down, and not demolish a place?  My friends and I were able to do these basics growing up.  Then again, I was an Eagle Scout, so perhaps my values are slightly different.\nAnyway,  thank you, Lacey and Omni Property Management, for making sure that I don't have to put up with that baggage.  I've got more important and fun things to do.  Lacey has always been available when I've phoned or emailed, and has returned my phone calls if she could not pick up right away.

They provided me with a solid, affordable rental with minimal hassle, which is far from the experiences I had with other property management agencies who jerked me around and one of which even stole money from me. Omni, on the other hand, conducted themselves with integrity and were very easy to work with for the duration of my lease. When something needed to be fixed, they got it fixed. If there was some sort of miscommunication, they did not hesitate to clear it up. They were always very kind with me, and when I moved out, I received my entire security deposit back; apparently this is rare among Bellingham rental agencies, but I wouldn't know because I've only ever rented from Omni and they were awesome. If you are an honest, respectful person, they will provide those same qualities in return. Don't hesitate to reach out to them if you need a place to rent!",

It synthesizes user reviews into a well-balanced overview of OMNI Property Management, highlighting both positive and negative aspects that customers have experienced. Please note that this article doesn't include all possible reviews due to condensation for brevity, and personal experiences with the company may vary.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Good</h2>    </heading>    <p>Many customers have reported satisfaction with OMNI Property Management's staff, citing their professionalism and responsiveness. Tenants have expressed gratitude for the helpfulness of the management, especially when dealing with maintenance requests. Speedy responses to problems and a clear concern for tenant and owner welfare were frequently mentioned. OMNI\u2019s ability to resolve maintenance concerns promptly, even during challenging times when contractor availability was scarce, has been a source of relief for several tenants.</p>    <p>Landlords and property owners have praised OMNI for its superb management services. The company has been commended for taking care of every detail, allowing property owners to have peace of mind, especially those living at a considerable distance from their properties. Homeowners have felt reassured by OMNI's professionalism and quick assistance on issues. The proactive approach to management and consistent on-time delivery of rental incomes was also appreciated.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Great</h2>    </heading>    <p>Among the compliments, customer reviews often highlighted individual staff members for their contribution. For example, Jessica was noted for her exceptional service, demonstrating the company's dedication to hiring staff who truly care about clients' experiences. Furthermore, the company has been responsive to reviews and customer feedback, indicating they value their customers' input and are willing to engage with and address any concerns raised publicly.</p>    <p>From a business standpoint, some property owners regarded hiring OMNI as one of the best business decisions they made, applauding the company for its affordability and the comprehensive attention given to their properties. The quick turnaround between tenants and the securing of reliable and responsible residents have also been points of high praise, helping property owners to minimize loss of income and maintain their properties well.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Bad</h2>    </heading>    <p>Unfortunately, not all experiences with OMNI Property Management have been positive. Some users have encountered difficulties, particularly with communication, finding it inconsistent and unprofessional at times. This has resulted in frustrations and left certain tenants feeling taken advantage of or inclined to move elsewhere. Additionally, specific concerns related to tenant rights and proper understanding of lease documents have been raised, with suggestions to consult state tenancy laws before signing agreements with OMNI.</p>    <p>There were also mentions of dissatisfaction with the handling of maintenance, specifically snow removal during the winter. The perceived neglect of tenant parking lots, in contrast to the well-maintained office parking, led to discontent about the company's prioritization. Such incidents have stirred up feelings of neglect among the tenants, who expected the company to apply similar standards of care to all managed properties.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading>      <h2>Ugly</h2>    </heading>    <p>Some blistering reviews characterized OMNI as negligent in their duties, with reports of rudeness and unprofessionalism from staff, including from higher levels of management. These negative experiences caused some reviewers to caution others against renting through OMNI, citing their own bitter experiences with the company. Furthermore, one tenant encountered a significant rent increase with what was deemed an unsympathetic response from the management when questioned.</p>    <p>Issues with handling security deposits have also emerged as a contentious point, with accusations of unfair charges being levied against former tenants. These charges, described as excessive by some, have led to disputes and profound dissatisfaction with OMNI's management practices. The tensions have been exacerbated by accounts of one-sided communication, with responses being provided selectively, contributing to an overall perception of unaccountability and lack of empathy from the management.</p>  </section></article>"
