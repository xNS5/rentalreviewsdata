It's not listed as \"student housing\" but is probably better than the options that are actually for students.\n\nI noticed that only some units have dishwashers; mine does not, even though the pictures I was provided showed that there was one, so if you're particular about wanting a dishwasher I would make sure you ask which units have them.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is the laundry situation- we share it with Laurel Court. It's a small room with 3 washers and 3 dryers and they're all old, coin operated, and kind of suck.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place! I've heard people in the past have had issues with PTLA but I never have. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a good fit for students.",
