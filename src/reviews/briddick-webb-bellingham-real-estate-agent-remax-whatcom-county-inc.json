We just purchased a condo and we were unavailable to go see it when it came on the market.   Briddick went over there himself, took videos for us, checked it out thoroughly and we made an offer for it based on his recommendation without having physically seen it. It closed today, we got our keys and his assistant Jillian opened the door for us to our new home with a thoughtful welcome gift.\n\nApproximately 6 years ago Briddick sold another condo for us in 5 days with multiple over-ask offers.\n\nA great guy, a great team.  We highly recommend them.\n\nJohn and Nancy Shogren",

When you work with The Briddick Webb Team, you, as their client come first. Through your input they will tailor their approach to achieve the goals that you desire in any real estate transaction.\n\nWe presented the Briddick Webb Team with a multilayered real estate scenario where we were selling our current home, while purchasing another home and a storage unit. The Briddick Webb Team worked with ourselves closely to achieve our desired goals. They offered guidance and support and truly listened to our needs and established a plan to achieve our goals. No matter what obstacles that presented themselves during the process, their caring and compassionate approach found a solution that was sound while taking care of our needs.\n\nWhenever I would request anything from Briddick, his response was always, No Problem! This proved to be true as he and his team were always able to deliver on their word, and we were able to realize our goals.\n\nIf you are looking for a Realtor whom knows the market and puts you as their client first, we recommend The Briddick Webb Team with highest regards. Briddick and his Team are simply best at what they do!",

They kept us informed regarding both the sale of one house and the purchase of another.  Their guidance and suggestions throughout the process were right on target and the closing process was the easiest that I have ever experienced (note: I have purchased and sold 7 houses over the years).  Briddick has vast knowledge of the real estate market in Whatcom County and is highly professional and makes the selling and buying experience a very pleasant one.  He and Jillian handled all the details promptly and efficiently and went the extra mile to assist us in both our search for a new property and the sale of our last property.

My fiance and I  had been working with him for well over a year trying to get a feel for the market before actually putting in any offers, and throughout the entire process Briddick was patient, knowledgeable, flexible, and willing to do anything for us. Every listing agent we met also had great things to say about Briddick and loved working with him as well. We were at a very competitive price point and did have our share of heartbreak, but Briddick was with us until the end, supporting us all the way until we finally found the perfect home.

The buyers learned this when flipping a mattress on closing day, despite close friends of the deceased offering to dispose of the bed to protect the emotional wellbeing of future owners.\nWhen the widowed partner contacted Briddick inquiring of the possibility of purchasing the home where she planned to raise a family, Briddick explained that a backup sale was in the works, and promptly asked if she was interested in an alternative property in the Bellingham area.\nThe emotionally inept, insensitive, and greedy behaviors of this individual should not be tolerated in our beloved Bellingham community.",

The one area of our lives which was steady, kind and professional was each and every member of the team and all our interactions with them. Questions were always answered quickly and with care to be accurate, clear and detail-oriented.\n\nThere was such a genuine interest and desire to know us all in ways which yielded great returns. He consistently and patiently heard us, diligently searched both listed and soon to be listed properties, and in the end found us just what we wanted. His referrals and hometown knowledge helped us throughout the process. I will be giving my unqualified and enthusiastic recommendation to any and all of my family and  friends considering a move here. If that is you then do yourself the favor of letting this team have your back. If you've made the decision to move to our new home, Bellingham, you couldn't do any better than Briddick and this team!",
