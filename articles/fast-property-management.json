        "review": "I'm 60 yrs old, and I have rented the same apartment in Woodland Townhomes since Aug 2012 (almost 11 yrs.) Speaking only from my own personal experiences.. Kris & Kim Fast have always been polite to me.. if your honest with them, if you respect them, they will respect you. I personally have never had a problem with management.. they've always given a 24-hr notice if they need to enter my apartment for any legit reason.\nThe maintenance man, Piers.. has always been nice & respectful towards me.. he's a thoughtful and understanding person.  Anna Fast who helps with management is polite and professional, it's always pleasant communicating with her.. she's a good person. Integrity & respect for others is everything, I recommend the Fast Property Management Team.",

My wife and I have had a great experience with them ...and that's not usually something tenants say of PMs.",

The 1 issue I've had in the multiple years renting with them they had someone out that day to check out the issue and get it fixed.\nDoubly impressive being when that I split with my partner they helped him find a similarly priced place in their management portfolio.\nNever been more impressed with a management company than with these guys. 100% would recommend",

  "summary": "<article>  <section>    <heading><h2>Disclaimer</h2></heading>    <p>This article was generated by ChatGPT and summarizes user reviews of Fast Property Management. The views expressed in this article are intended merely to provide insights into the services provided by Fast Property Management and should be used as a tool to help you in your decision-making process for finding a property management company or rental property. This article reflects both positive and negative aspects based on user reviews up to the knowledge cutoff in March 2023.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Good</h2></heading>    <p>Many tenants have highlighted the efficiency and reliability of Fast Property Management when it comes to responding to maintenance issues. The property management team's prompt action has often been praised, with one reviewer recounting an instance where an issue was quickly resolved on the same day it was reported. Such experiences have been a reassuring aspect for renters who value timely solutions to property-related concerns.</p>    <p>Moreover, the company receives frequent commendations for the courteousness and professionalism of its staff. Users have described positive interactions with team members, emphasizing their polite and helpful demeanor. This has contributed to a favorable view of the company's customer service, showcasing Fast Property Management as a company that prioritizes tenant satisfaction.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Great</h2></heading>    <p>Apart from service responsiveness, Fast Property Management stands out for its adherence to respectful practices such as providing a 24-hour notice before entering tenants' apartments, as mentioned in one testimonial. Such practices have helped build trust and a sense of respect between management and renters, proving to be a cornerstone of the company's ethical management standards.</p>    <p>Tenants have also noted the company's caring attitude toward its residents, with some users reporting a tenancy duration of several years while consistently experiencing a high level of service. This not only highlights Fast Property Management's ability to foster long-term tenant relationships but also signifies their dedication to maintaining an amicable and accommodating business approach.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Bad</h2></heading>    <p>Although the general tone of reviews is exceptionally positive, it is possible that Fast Property Management's dedication may occasionally falter, a concern that is not reflected in the reviews provided. For instance, potential areas of occasional shortcomings such as delays in addressing less urgent maintenance requests, lapses in communication during peak times, or inconsistencies in service provision across different properties have not been highlighted in the user reviews. However, these are common issues faced by many property management companies and should be considered by potential clients.</p>    <p>With every company, there is always room for improvement, and while user reviews do not currently reflect this, there may be instances where tenants have experienced difficulties but have not publicized their experiences. Prospective tenants should therefore always approach reviews with a balanced perspective and consider asking the company directly about their policies for handling such matters.</p>  </section>  <section>    <heading><h2>Ugly</h2></heading>    <p>It's essential to note that the current swath of reviews fails to present any significant adverse experiences, leaving the 'ugly' aspects of the management company largely unreported or non-existent in the available data. This absence is indicative either of the company\u2019s proficient management standards or a lack of feedback from dissatisfied tenants. Without concrete negative feedback, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive picture of any potential flaws within Fast Property Management's operational practices.</p>    <p>The lack of negative reviews could potentially be misleading, as it is unusual for a company to achieve perfect satisfaction across all tenants. It's always advisable for prospective renters to conduct thorough due diligence, seek out additional feedback from current or past tenants, and communicate clearly with the management company to understand how issues are typically resolved should they arise.</p>  </section></article>"
