        "review": "Absolutely horrible. I have been a tenant for 1 1/2 years and they have not once answered the phone, returned my calls, answered an email, or resolved any issues. The maintenance team has come in twice and left things in disarray and left their garage on my floors. Today they apparently came into my apartment while I was working and stole one of my kitchen drawers and left the stuff that was in said drawer dumped all over my countertop. I have even gone to the office in person with not much luck. I work in property management so I understand the ropes and this is the WORST property management I have experienced. I feel unsafe living here.",

        "review": "Its hard to not be frustrated after years of being here. It causes me anxiety to even think about the place, even though I have been moved out since February. The staff are underpaid and overworked. My mail was stolen more than once from this location. Indigo Real Estate is in Seattle, and doesnt give a damn about the tenants in these buildings as long as their standards and regulations are seemingly kept up to par. My neighbor was shooting drugs, dealing to strangers, smoking cigarettes in his apartment, and at one point multiple people banged on my back sliding glass door thinking my unit was his. No matter how many written complaints I made, the management could not or would not kick him out. His car window got bashed and he blamed it on my family even though we saw three people he used to deal to roaming the parking lots for a few days prior and heard them state that he owed them money. After that we decided to move, and the management charged us an arm and a leg for services that werent done to our unit because they mixed us up with another unit that had moved out the same week and trashed their place (luckily most charges were removed).\n\nIts a big relief in my life to be rid of this place. Even though the location was convenient, the neighbors were not, and it was not a kid friendly/family friendly neighborhood. I would never recommend it to anyone who can afford something else.",

        "review": "This place has gone really down hill, the dog waist trash cans are overflowing constantly, there seems to be garbage and dog waist everywhere. Its disgusting and un sanitary! There is almost never any dog waist bags either. There are random holes in the ground that Im constantly tripping on in the larger field, making it a safety hazard, and graffiti on the playground. The people working here always seem to be rude. They didnt put anything down when it got Icy and multiple people were slipping and falling. They just dont seem to care about there tenants at all.",

        "review": "We've lived here for years, the first half was great, the second half wasn't. What changed? The apartments got bought out by a different company. After the take over office hours seemed to be cut in half, and the overworked staff got rude, understandably as they now have the same amount of work to do, in about half the time. Our car has been broken into twice. The staff didn't even say \"that sucks\" just \"that happens\". Our upstairs neighbor is loud and vacuums as late as 4am. Despite it claiming in the lease this is against the policy, the staff refuses to do anything. Our lease ended this month, and we got a letter saying that our rent is going up by $175 dollars. Making our one bedroom cost more than our 2 bedroom 2 years ago! When we brought this up to the staff their response was \"well, now the two bedrooms are $1300. (This is untrue, our old roommate said the rent changed from 875 to 1200) and told my wife she could get a second job or go on government assistance! The nerve! Well we found a new apartment, and when we went to notify the office of our intent to move they told us that we are a day late for the 20 day prior. One. Freaking. Day. Late. So now we have to pay 387 dollars plus rent for everyday the apartment isn't filled with a new tenant. For being one day late. They refused to give us any leeway on this. Now here the real assinine part. We never intended to move until the beginning of this month, despite everything we were going to sign a new lease, until we saw that the rent was increasing by 175 dollars. We got that notice 30 days before we had to sign a new lease, and we have to give notice of intent to leave 20 days before the lease signing, meaning we had to find and get approved for a new apartment all within 10 days. I had to take sick days at work to do that. And we were still one day late. This place blows, no one move in.",

        "review": "The staff is overwhelmingly rude and disorganized. The people living here are shady and hostile. It's definitely not a place I recommend anyone to live. People steal the reserved parking regularly, there's garbage all over the parking lot, people are too loud. I couldn't tell you how many times I've woken up in the middle of the night on a work night because of the inconsiderate people living here. Maintenance issues also take about a month or so to get resolved.. So that's ALWAYS a plus",

        "review": "Section 8 housing offers a huge tax break. I get it. Cascade Meadows staff work hard for very little pay. They are yelled at every day by some of the craziest people in Bellingham. And they endure. They do their best and I really appreciate the people.\n\nThe company that purchased Cascade Meadows is called Indigo Real Estate. They couldn't care less about their employees or residents. This is the only place I know of in Whatcom that doesn't recycle. At all.\n\nGood location. A gamble on neighbors. Good customer service.",

The extremely rude office ladies and a sarcastic and rude maintenance staff. even the most simple question is \"answered\" with a passive aggressive tone. my neighbors a few numbers down broke their lease to and had to pay around $1000 just to get out of here! the rent goes up every year and the quality of the apartment is pretty shabby.

One user expressed appreciation for the hard work the staff puts in, even in challenging circumstances, indicating that they endure tough situations caused by difficult tenants and occasional disorganization.</p><p>The apartments themselves have been described as well-kept and in a convenient location. Some reviews highlight amenities such as in-unit washers and dryers, which tenants find appealing. Overall, those who have had positive experiences with Cascade Meadows appreciate the community feel and the effort that staff make, suggesting that the property has potential under better management.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>While many reviews are critical, a few tenants have reported satisfactory living experiences at Cascade Meadows. One user specifically mentioned that the rental rates were reasonable and expressed pleasure in their accommodations, including the availability of laundry facilities and dishwashers. This indicates that, for some, the property meets their basic lifestyle needs while being budget-friendly.</p><pAdditionally, several tenants have praised particular staff members, expressing gratitude for their assistance. These positive experiences reflect that there can be moments of effective management and tenant-care within the broader, often disappointing context of the property\u2019s reputation. It's clear that the experience at Cascade Meadows can vary significantly depending on individual circumstances and expectations.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>The negative reviews at Cascade Meadows often focus on the management's communication and maintenance issues. Many users have reported a lack of responsiveness from the staff, stating that calls and emails frequently go unanswered. A tenant mentioned feeling unsafe after a troubling incident with maintenance staff, which escalated into personal property being tampered with. This lack of trust can lead to significant anxiety for residents.</p><pAdditionally, many users cited issues with cleanliness and general upkeep of the premises. For instance, overflowing waste bins and litter in the common areas have been noted, impacting the living experience negatively. This consistent theme of neglect suggests that while some tenants may appreciate certain aspects of the community, the overall management of maintenance and communication leaves much to be desired.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><pThe \"ugly\" side of Cascade Meadows is highlighted by numerous accounts of experiences that contribute to a sense of dread among the tenants. One user described an alarming incident where their unit was entered without consent, resulting in personal belongings being tampered with, which breaches tenant rights and trust. Another tenant recounted feeling unsafe due to a neighbor's disruptive and potentially harmful behavior that management neglected to address despite multiple complaints.</p><pFurthermore, the rising rent costs and financial disputes upon moving out have mired the reputation of Cascade Meadows. Several tenants expressed frustration over extra charges related to their security deposit refunds, indicating a bleak view of how tenants' finances are handled in this organization. Such experiences paint a grim picture of the consequences of living here, leading to the conclusion that potential renters should exercise caution before making a decision.</p></section>"
