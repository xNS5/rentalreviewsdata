Everything related to payments and maintenance can be done through their online portal, which is very convenient. I also appreciate the transparency of all the building fees, which they send directly to your office in a letter.\n\nSomething else that's nice about the Bellingham Bank Building is that it's always clean, with security cameras everywhere. You need a keycard to enter and use the elevator (at night), but the offices have regular keys.\n\nOverall I've had a very positive experience and will be renewing my lease.",

        "review": "The staff is great, and the building I lived in (the Leopold building) was wonderful. Jena Curry and the rest managing the Leopold apartments were excellent. They were really quick to respond to whatever issues I had, and were happy to help me figure out some of the more (at first irritating, later charming) features of my room. The Leopold is an old building with a lot of original fixtures, and they preserved as much as they could - if you're willing to trade a bit of modern convenience for some antique charm, then you should rent with these guys. A last note, having just finished an early lease break; I had to move quickly due to family, and the Daylight staff were really quick to help me find a new tenant, get the proper forms filed early, and make my move happen with very little difficulty. I cannot recommend them highly enough",

The building was safe and secure and clean. The neighbors were cool. The staff were friendly and easy to work with, and the rent was more than fair. When I wanted to upgrade they worked with me to find something in my price range within their other properties and though I didn't end up changing units, I appreciated their effort. I will miss my cute little apartment. It was a very special place. I would have stayed there forever if I didn't buy a house.",

Daylight Properties does not own these carts.  \n\nPlease feel free to contact our office directly with any issues you may have as a resident of our Leopold Apartments.

This in turn led to the installation of a new fire suppressant system in 2015.  This process may have caused a temporary inconvenience to the residents, but the increased safety to our Tenants is more important."

I wanted my bedroom door changed, I wanted some of the paint colors in my living room and kitchen swapped, and I wanted my refrigerator door mounted to open on the opposite side.  Some of these seemed kind of minor and made me feel like I was just being picky.  So, honestly, I really wasn't sure what to expect or if this would be taken seriously.  Boy was I surprised.  Jena, the Leasing Manager, immediately noted my requests and made me feel like they were well received.  Then she had a maintenance technician, Keith, contact me the very next business day!  Keith met with me within 48 hours of that!  He was great.  We walked through my apartment, looked at all of my requests, and came up with a plan to address all of them.  Every single one!!!  He was so easy to work with and was very personable and responsive to everything I had listed.  He didn't, for a single minute, make me feel like I was just being picky, even though I had thought I was.  The whole experience was incredible and now I am living in a place that I've been able to make my own, with their help.  It's really encouraging knowing what a great team there is supporting me.

I responded to an ad on Craigslist for office space.  \"Hannah\", who apparently is in charge of showings, indicated that she had a 10:45am slot available for showing it to me.  I then called back and got her voicemail, confirming I would be there at the appointed time.  She then called me back to say \"Sorry, that time slot is taken and I don't have time until next week.\"  What?  Due to the fact that this was a small space, perfect for my needs and she was throwing up roadblocks to showing it to me and wouldn't lease it to me without showing it to me...but had no time to show it (a vicious, circular loop of highly unachievable conditions), I offered to give her a deposit right there and then.  But, that was refused.  She said she would show it to me this morning if it was still available, but that it \"would probably be leased by then.\"  I then called one of the principals, he listened, but then told me to call \"Hannah\" again.  Right! A big \"No Thanks!\" on that one!  So, this morning, she calls me to say she can show it to me, but she has a \"lease pending.\"  Pathetic!

One tenant expressed immense satisfaction with how the management team handled various requests and maintenance issues, indicating that they felt comfortable and well-supported throughout their rental period. Another review pointed out that, despite the age of the buildings, regular maintenance and cleaning significantly contributed to an enjoyable living experience.</p><pAdditionally, tenants appreciate the range of unique properties offered by Daylight, from quaint residential options to commercially viable spaces.

One user noted dissatisfaction with the company's policy on charging fees for mistakes made by tenants while highlighting a seemingly one-sided approach to accountability regarding billing. This sentiment points to a perceived lack of fairness when it comes to resolving disputes or addressing billing inconsistencies from the company's side.</p><pMoreover, some reviews indicate that tenants faced communication challenges, particularly regarding appointment scheduling for property showings. Instances were mentioned where interested parties arrived for viewings only to find no one available to meet them, leading to frustration and lost opportunities. This suggests a need for improved operational procedures in communication and scheduling to enhance prospective tenant experiences.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Certain reviews shed light on a more troubling aspect of Daylight Properties' management practices, particularly surrounding tenant relations. Some users have reported a lack of response to critical issues raised, indicating feelings of being neglected post-rental agreement. Specific instances of unresolved maintenance concerns or inadequate attention to tenant feedback were mentioned, painting a picture of a disconnect in customer service experience, which could deter potential renters.</p><pAdditionally, a few complaints centered around the aggressive nature of contracts and policies, which some tenants expressed as being disproportionately favorable to the company. This includes concerns over punitive practices that could overshadow the rental experience for unsuspecting tenants, leading to frustration and a sense of being taken advantage of financially. Such sentiment unfortunately weighs down the otherwise solid reputation the company has built with many satisfied renters.</p></section>"
