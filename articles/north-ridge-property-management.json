Tonya with North Ridge property management is an awesome property manager and she has made our move in and  living experience here smooth and enjoyable. She is very responsive to maintenance needs and any other questions we have. It is refreshing to get this level of customer service even after we signed the lease and renewed our lease! I definitely recommend living here and working with Tonya.",
