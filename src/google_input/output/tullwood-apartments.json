      "review": "There is a homeless community right outside the fences of the apartments. They never interfere physically with the activities of those living inside, but nearly EVERY NIGHT, you can hear them arguing, screaming, and sometimes even SHOOTING GUNS while those inside try to live their normal day to day lives. Then, once you get past that, there's the fog, the faulty fire alarms, the dirty and poorly kept stairs and elevators, and a locked \"bathroom\" that is in the ground floor hallway, for whatever reason. (Even though all of the apartments have actual bathrooms.)\n\nThe streets around it are filled with boring malls, a complete lack of sidewalks, and the occasional road kill. At least the food close by is affordable. But even then, it's not worth going out for a walk unless you like forests full of trash. Or boring parking lots. Literally, these apartments are here solely to crash in if you can't afford to live closer to the center of the city.\n\nThis part of town probably used to be a beautiful forest a few decades ago, but now it's just the wastebin of snobby capitalists and starving hobos. I would give Tullwood Apartments a 3 normally, but the boring gray shopping \"district\" and the constant yelling from homeless (including as I write this right now) makes this barely a 2. I'd probably give it a 1.5 if I could. There's literally a car stuffed full of an old homeless ladies' junk in the parking lot, and nobody cares. I am very tired.",

(carrying up large packages,  watching out for my daughter, answering my questions quickly and helping us resolve leasing and key issues quickly)  I feel so much better knowing I can reach out to him.  I visited recently and while there could be some improvements in some areas I felt much better and at ease knowing Dan was there to help!

Dan has been knocking them out of the park since he started here a few months back. We finally got carport lights replaced, the front gate gets fixed same day rather than a week later, we gained a handicap access door, and he's taking care of the hallway carpet smell here very soon. Cameras are going up rather than just being talked about. The man is all around improving this place and we appreciate it. Thank you, Dan.",

The walls are super thick so you almost never hear your side neighbors a little noise from upstairs but thats to be expected. There is a homeless camp behind this building but they keep adding more security to keep us safe which I appreciate. Not to pricey for the size either.",

I have plenty of space in my unit; a washer and dryer in an actual laundry room, a large bathroom, etc. Plus it's pet friendly! I like that any store I need is just a couple minute drive.

We lost everything in the floods that hit Sumas in Nov 2021 and I wasnt sure if I would even find a place for my family on such short notice. Thankfully a friend of mine told me about Tullwood so we applied and it couldnt of been more wonderful. We were in our new apartment before Christmas and havent been happier. We know there are elements outside the gate but we are pretty much safe and secure with Amy and the security officers around.\nIts a nice location with extremely nice apartments.

It was a God send. But still not able to recover from the flood financially and my husband losing his job we fell drastically behind on bills. A last ditch effort I tried talking to Amy our landlord for some sort of extention or anything to help us.

She is always willing to spend time on how we can align our goals to help each other and make sure residents are number one priority. She always promotes Xfinitys low income internet Internet Essentials, she knows that will benefit her residents, when visiting her, getting the common area fixed up and starting with getting all the tvs working and updated with new equipment, i got that set up and sorted out then we even held a small event in the common area, you can tell her residents really like her, many came down to say hello which gave us an opportunity to meet all the residents and introduce ourselves, she expressed the security issue and how worried she was for her property but most of all her deep concern for her residents, I knew this was a huge concern and was able to help her get in contact with a Comcast business rep to go over options for her. Amy and all the residents have always been welcoming and very willing to listen to ways that I can help her property when it comes to Xfinity and Comcast. I look forward to working with her for many more years.",

A new playground has been scheduled to be installed in early spring, the carpets have been removed and the odor along with them.  No rules have been put into place to keep all common areas clear, no trash or other items are allowed to be stored in the hallways.  Some of the parking spaces are small, so larger vehicles need to park in the back parking lot, when the lot is re-stripped we are going to try to widen the spaces to make it easier for people to park.

Now the manager on the other hand was super nice until she decided to fine me for everything she could possibly think of. I ultimately decided to sign a lease early termination and that's when she really screwed me over by claiming I owe over 10 grand in fees.

Honestly, I never thought I would have such an amazing time here. Amy was so king to us, literally we got free furniture from her, she hooked us up with Internet because she knows a person at Xfinity (we tried another service but they would not give us internet until a week later) but the xfinity guy hooked it up for us the same night because of Amy!!\n\nAmy really does go above and beyond, and if you have questions, she is super responsive! She even gave us the key to our apartment wayyy after office hours around 10pm! That alone saved us a nights cost for a hotel room!\n\nThe best part is, its a safe neighborhood, literally 5 mins walk to Walmart and maybe 15 mins walk to restaurants and stores like Best Buy etc. Also, the people here are all families or working professionals.

In the interest of full disclosure, I give out Woods coffee cards to tenants when they are spotted doing a good deed, like helping a neighbor or going out of their way to keep the community safe. I also have thrown Tenant Appreciation parties, passed out food boxes to the doors of tenants in need, purchased many gallons of milk and bread to pass out to tenants who might be struggling in the wake of our current situation, as well as worked with tenants who need special arrangements made for rent and fees as you will remember I did for you during your time as a tenant here. This has been my practice as a property manager for my entire career even prior to my four years at Tullwood, and lending a helping hand is who I am.
