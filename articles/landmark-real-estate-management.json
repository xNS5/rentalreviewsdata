The website is user-friendly, making it easy to view available listings, schedule a showing, and submit my application online. All staff members I interacted with were friendly, helpful, and responsive via text, phone, and when I viewed the unit in person. All important building policies and costs were clearly laid out in writing and the staff I spoke with made sure to highlight and confirm important details. The entire process was smooth.",

Not having moved in a long time I was unsure what to expect, but the entire process was pretty smooth. The unit is as good as advertised. Applying was straightforward enough, and the company responded quickly to any questions I had. I was surprised at the number of documents that I had to sign, but I realize this is all part of the procedures for moving. I'll see how things progress from here, but so far Landmark has been good in the apartment they had and the support needed.",

Cami and Yanna were very helpful, efficient and did such a wonderful job explaining everything to us and helping us through our application process. They were also very good with following up. And understanding when my situation changed and we ended staying longer. They helped us renew our lease the second time. Stress free!! Everything was easy and smooth and that is more than you can ask for in such a stressful moving time. Every time we need anything fixed, it was always done in a timely manner and with good quality. I feel comfortable calling and speaking to them about any questions I have? Thank you so much to the team at Landmark Real Estate Management!!",

        "review": "Updated: If you choose to be a customer of Landmark, make sure you know your rights and how to advocate for yourself. I am typically pretty easy going, and I love to avoid conflicts when I can. I am slow to escalate situations, and I am patient for people to have opportunities to do right. I had to contact the Better Business Bureau to get Landmark to take me seriously enough to do the job correctly this time.\n\nI notified Landmark about the issue in my bathroom in August of 2023 after they purchased and took over my property and raised my rent $300 in one go. (I didnt have much leverage to fight it because I was without a lease as my previous landlord didnt resign my lease before leaving, and Landmark wanted me to agree to the $300 to begin a lease and I chose to eat the cost due to lack of funding to unexpectedly move out at the time.)\n\nThey wanted me to agree to raise my rent $50 in April of this year, and I reminded them of my bathroom. They are just now getting a plan of action for a solution to get it done right this time, and it is June of 2024, nearly a year after I originally notified them.\n\nAfter I continued to follow up, in May of 2024, they offered us to move into a neighboring apartment that has visible mold growing and water damage, as seen in the photos below. It also smelled musty or of stale something like smoke, Im not sure as I was unable to identify it myself. The window lock was broken, the electrical outlets were all pulled away from the wall and faceplates broken, the tub was stained pink, the bathroom cabinet was water damaged to the point of the cabinet wall separating from its self and showing the actual wall between the crack, as visible in a photo below. There was spiders and cobwebs in the corners at the level of the floor. When I complained, Landmark assured me that they had checked in with the cleaners over email. It was dirty. I informed them, and they were slow to respond.\n\nEventually Landmark offered us another neighboring apartment whose bathroom is directly against ours. We also happen to know the neighbor who lived there before had her ceiling fall through from sewage in her bathroom. The ceiling falling through happened over a year ago, and I dont know if this is where the smell came from, but when we entered the apartment upon offer on June 6, 2024, it visually appeared cleaner, however it smelled like sewage, especially inside underneath the kitchen sink, which happens to be on the opposite side of the wall as the bathroom toilet. Inside the bathroom of the second apartment they offered us, that smelled like sewage inside, the base of the toilet was also shattered, as seen in the photo below. I let Landmark know it smells like sewage and the toilet is a safety hazard. They took time to respond again and finally called this morning, June 12, 2024, to come to an agreement, coincidentally the same day I contacted the Better Business Bureau to request help to resolve this unfortunate issue.\n\nIf Landmark just worked with me to come to a solution in a timely and legal manner in the first place, I wouldnt have felt the need to escalate the situation to this point. Im already exhausted and I didnt want to deal with this, but here we are.\n\nAs a customer, I highly recommend requesting a walkthrough with Landmark in person, take photos of any and all blemishes and concerns, and send them to landmark with writing that states anything you notice, and dont sign to live anywhere if its not up to standards if you have the option. Luckily I have the ability to advocate for myself. Not everyone is so privileged.\n\nOur community deserves safe, sanitary, and affordable housing!

        "review": "Landmark gets some points for being pretty much the only apartments that don't require you to make 3 times the rent amount in income (which is unreasonable for many of us), as long as you have the savings to pay the first six months upfront.  But the rest of the points were gone once they used us to pay for improvements as we left.\n\nWhen we entered the place, it had not been maintained properly.  Nails stuck up from the median between the kitchen and living room.  Rust-prone nails used in the bathroom.  Blinds that didn't reach all the down so our neighbors could see me sleeping.  For f***'s sake, the fridge was just a little bit in the oven's way, so you had to open the fridge door to open the oven door!  My engineer brother kept pointing out various other improper repairs he noticed.  But we hammered down the nail, taped under the blinds, shifted over the oven, and made ourselves a home, burdened only by rowdy neighbors (courtesy of the nearby college I'd bet) and often insufficient parking.  It was the cheapest 2-bedroom apartment around, and it showed, but it wasn't terrible, and we lived there for a few years.\n\nThen it was time for us to move, as they decided the whole complex would not have their leases renewed, and we had to move.  They gave us 8 months forewarning, ahead of the contractually agreed notice, which I do appreciate.  We gave the place a quick once-over cleaning and left, as other life events got in the way and we couldn't give it a proper cleaning.  Ah well, the $1000 deposit was for this kind of thing.  Then we get a notice that it's all used up plus we need to pay another $600.  Why?\n\nClaims that the blinds were damaged (not that I could see any from their inspection pictures), water damage from one of the reported leaks prior, \"missing\" bulb covers.  You see, I didn't know about the importance of taking pictures/video of everything when moving in and out, so I couldn't prove that not all the lights tucked under the cover were good when we arrived, etc.  Of course, judging by us paying for the damage from their poor plumbing, I guess they'd make sure we still paid out the nose even if we HAD proper documentation.  They had a committee for reviewing security deposit cases, but a couple days later we got a message of basically \"We investigated ourselves and found ourselves faultless\", you know how it goes.  I expected most of that deposit to be gone, as I left the bathtub filthy, but I didn't expect to be charged so much for \"we forgot how sloppy we kept this place when we handed it to you\", and my contentions fell on deaf ears that wanted to use me as much as they thought they could get away with to make the place better than they left it.\n\nSo if you must take Landmark, go for it.  Your stay will be tolerable, and the courteous management will keep in touch with you about recent issues/repairs.  But take a picture/video of absolutely everything, including empty uninteresting surfaces.  Because they will make you prove that the hallway DIDN'T have door stoppers when you arrived.  Also, while not uncommon these days, they still lose points with me for doing the predatory \"you must renew leases 6 months ahead of time or lose it\" that ensures you can't shop around without risk of being without a home altogether.  Brace for the pain that only true slumlords can deliver.\n\nOh, and if you can't afford parking permits right now, just park anyway.  It takes a few months of overfull lots before they consider maybe enforcing parking.",

        "review": "My experience with Landmark was very mixed. Signed a year-long lease with two roommates, lived in a house from September 2023 through September 2024. If I was able to write a review for just one person (Lolly, our property manager) it would definitely be 5 stars; she was excellent at communicating, great to talk to, and adept at solving our problems. And we had a LOT of problems.\n\nLandmark pays a separate company to clean their properties in between a change of tenants. Whoever they hire just didnt do half the job. Our downstairs bathroom had dust and debris all over the floor and in the tub, there was food waste and literal garbage in the kitchen cabinets (so we got to move in and immediately deal with ants ), the upstairs floors were incredibly dirty, both bathroom doors had weird marks on them, and they left one of the burners of the stove on! Luckily, we held onto the move-in sheet and listed everything we found. Landmark eventually compensated us for the cleaning WE had to do, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nWe also had some issues with bills. During the original application process, one of my roommates submit paystubs from two different jobs to indicate she made enough money to qualify for the rent payments. Whoever ran our applications kept insisting that she didnt qualify and had to get someone to co-sign. It got to the point where my roommate had to send an email where she did the (elementary-school level) math for them. After that, we didnt get a response for over a week, and I had to call landmark just to get an update on whether we got the spot or if we had to keep looking for somewhere else to live. Whoever I spoke with on the phone informed me that we got the spot, and told me the person who had been sending those emails would be calling my roommate to apologize for the inconvenience and lack of communication. For that, I would love to be able to give Landmark props for fixing their problems, but when my roommate received the apology call she was met with some serious attitude and was yelled at for not submitting everything correctly the first time. It was clear this person was only calling because she got in trouble for being bad at her job, and had her feelings hurt when someone called her out. We also had an issue where Landmark took rent payment from this roommate over a week after they said they would, and this discrepancy in expected payment dates caused her to have an overdrafted account. Landmark then charged her $300 for insufficient funds. Now, this very well may have been a genuine mistake, something that just happens sometimes. But me and the third roommate never had this issue with our rent payments, and I find it funny that the only person this happened to was the one who called out a worker at Landmark for not being able to do basic math \n\nNow, Landmark overall doesnt feel as slum lordy as other property management companies in Bellingham. I know people who had their security deposit outright stolen from them by Utopia (formerly Chuckanut Properties). Again, Lolly was fantastic; she responded promptly, gave the impression that she really cared about us as human beings, and helped us deal with things that werent entirely Landmarks fault (e.g. she contacted City of Bham water for us after they shut off our water because the prior tenants hadnt paid their final water bill). If everyone at Landmark had showed her energy and gone the extra mile like she did, I could easily see myself giving a perfect review. But I just cant do that when they gave us shit before moving in, left a burner of the stove on, left garbage in the kitchen, and then had the audacity to charge us for leaving a couple thumbtack holes in one of the bedrooms.\n\nIn summary, Landmark has at least one rockstar employee, and at least a couple more who do their job poorly. The company overall deserves two stars out of five. And, despite this, they might genuinely be the best option for large property-management companies in Bellingham   if you decide to rent through them, hope you get Lolly ",

There were some kind of unexpected charges, or ways that perhaps we misunderstood things (e.g., the utilities charge is not $40 for the unit but $40 per person), but all-in-all, pre-move-in has been smooth. More later!\n\nSo far, the application process with Landmark has been smooth! The various staff members I've spoken with have been friendly and helpful, and the process was made extremely clear. Their application fee is $65, compared to $50 for most other property managers in Bellingham, but so far that is our only criticism.

In this economy, the competition for housing is overwhelming so if you find a place that looks good, you have to jump on the application. But now, they say it's not first come first serve unless you pay the nonrefundable holding fee. This is extremely predatory. We were pressured into paying this before we had seen the unit. Then we went to see the unit only to discover that it was completely misrepresented as a 2 bedroom. It is not a legal 2 bedroom. It is a 1 bedroom with a windowless office. This seems criminal. Now we are locked into an apartment that is going to be uninhabitable for our family. Now we have 48 hours to sign a lease or what? You get to keep the nearly $500 I gave you? It's really greedy of you. I'm going into this lease very unhappy and looking immediately for somewhere else to rent.\n\nOn top of all of that, I asked to be shown an empty unit and the person at the front desk did not relay that to the person showing me the apartment so I was unable to take measurements like I needed to. So now I have to go into the moving process not knowing what furniture I need to keep or get rid which is very inconvenient. And of course you don't just have the dimensions or a floorplan because you don't think of your renters as humans who might need to know that stuff. We're just cattle you cram into these unconscionably small boxes that you massively overprice. Bellingham City Council needs to do something about this. I'm writing a letter to the mayor to encourage her to actually do something about the greedy,  predatory, and criminal rental companies in this town. I thought Landmark was one of the decent companies because I rented with them before and it was fine but it seems they have lost their minds. Greed ultimately corrupts.

Ive felt like every concern Ive had over the 3 years Ive been a tenant has been answered in a prop and timely manner.  Most renters have encountered challenges with their rental. A appliance goes out, issues with a fuse box etc which is of course to be expected. Any homeowner can tell you the challenges one can face within the home and what it takes to fix it.  As a renter, its so important to have a landlord or management company that takes these issues seriously and fixes them promptly.  Fortunately with our Manager Cami Winslow, every concern or issue has been resolved quickly and fixed correctly.  Knowing that these things will be fixed when needed is invaluable and the biggest reason we are staying with Landmark and at our current residence.",

They're highly likely to keep your deposit no matter what, potentially charge you beyond your thousand dollar deposit, and never respond to maintenance calls. The second year the bathtub was clogged from move in time, the walls have unpainted putty all over them, trim around the edges rotting out, no weather trimming on front door, dishwasher filled with black mold. The agent I had showing the property was an hour and a half late, didn't know which key was for the buildings front door, or how to access the laundry room. If you're new to town, DON'T rent through them if you can help it. They mostly own property around the university to take advantage of students who've never rented before and don't know better.",

Ocean, the first lady I spoke with, was rude and short with me. She doesn't tell you what she is going to do she just sends you off to someone. I asked her not to just send me off to a voicemail, because this was a time sensitive matter and instead of talking with me to solve this issue, she transferred me anyway. When I called back in, I got someone else (I can't remember her name, unfortunately) and she was extremely disrespectful. I don't know what happened in the two minutes it took me to call back, but as soon as I introduced myself, she had a terrible attitude. Immediately was talking over me, cutting me off when I tried to explain the situation, raised her voice at me, and accused me of yelling at her. It was the WORST customer service interaction I've ever had. She was extremely rude, disrespectful, unkind, unwilling to help resolve the issue at hand, as is her job. She is obviously incapable of handling that position, if that is how she treats the tenants calling in for assistance. I asked to be transferred to her supervisor, and she was snarky about it, but luckily transferred me right away. I spoke with Wendy. Wendy was amazing. Clearly, knew how to do her job, and what customer service meant. Literally, all I wanted was an escalation so that my property manager knew that I was trying to reach her about a time sensitive issue. That's it. That's a completely reasonable request, and Wendy was able to  help me with that in 5 minutes. So, in my experience, don't go into that office, expecting to be treated with dignity. At least not by those two workers. They showed very clearly that they have no desire to be respectful or uphold any standard to customer service.",

Its nice to be left alone as a tenant, we never had the quarterly inspections or really anyone give us a hard time (except once when they told us we had to mow our lawn, it definitely looked better long but I understand).\nHowever, this lack of communication is why we really didn't enjoy their management. We never (not once!) got emails back when we had questions, if things broke (and things were broken most of the time) it took hours and many, many phone calls to get a hold of anyone. I missed multiple days of classes trying to get in touch with someone about our heating being out during the coldest month of February (it got below 15 degrees and we had no heat in our house).\nOn that note, there were so many issues with our house which were genuine safety concerns - windows being painted shut, our single toilet consistently breaking (like at least twice a month) and then randomly starting again -- we once called the emergency line because it was a weekend and their response was that we needed to wait until Monday... there were 5 of us and ONE TOILET. Their solution to the no heat problem was to send over 6 space heaters, which immediately flipped the circuits and forced our fridge and freezer to shut off. Our stove top looked like someone had shot at it (literally bullet hole looking things) and the \"5th\" bedroom they advertised was the size of a walk in closet and I as a 5'2 person could stand straight up only right inside the door. There was no windows in that room and it got above 110 degrees on sunny summer days. I lived in the basement because the fifth bedroom was not a room, the dryer very near to when we moved in got a disconnected aluminum tube that was supposed to send hot wet air outside. Well, it instead filled my room with all of that wet hot air anytime any one used it. We asked them to fix it, got asked to be sent photos, and after we did, no one ever followed up or came to look at it. I tried taping it myself but the moisture was to intense for the tape to stick. My entire room and most of my stuff was often damp for a full year.\nI was often genuinely concerned for my well being and the well being of my roommates and I am so glad we decided to move.",

Be careful if you're living in a unit on Alabama because some of the stuff has not been fixed or serviced since 2020 and wires are exposed. In the unit as well as mold and a bunch of other stuff that they refused to fix even though they had my holding deposit for over a month and a 1/2 and held me up looking for another place and refused to do any kind of work on the townhouse. Says that they will have their financial department. Reach? Out to you when your holding fee is ready but it will take more than two weeks to get back and they hold you up more! I'm glad I won't be renting from them and that housing saved me for a headache!!",

HOWEVER, I called the office and spoke to Ashley, who was so understanding and incredible. I had called my bank and I was pretty sure that the charge wouldn't go through at all, but I won't know until after my rent payment is technically late. She not only assured me that it obviously was not my fault that the charge was incorrect, but she helped me fix the whole mess that I am in and made sure that I would not be charged any late fees for when it is fixed. Other than that, I haven't had any other issues with Landmark. She did say that this happened to a few people though, so I would check in with them to make sure that your online account is set up right before the last few months of your lease. They really need to change their system.\nTheir customer service regarding the main office has always been great for me though.

Prompt maintenance, responce to emails, and clear communication (I am also the person to read every word in a contract, which helps avoid surprises because I know what I am getting into. Definitely reccomend for some of these 1 star people). They do have a weird thing with lease takeovers where the security deposit continues through the years, but if you trust your takeover people then we simply figured it out like adults and the people moving in paid the people moving out. It is a weird law but not the end if the world. I also appreciate that we can pay a securing deposit for an apartment we like before viewing or before our applications are processed. Sure, it is a gamble as to whether we get our money back, but it is a well informed one that we take advantage of in the competitive apartment world of bellingham.

Recently, they changed the new team and it's horrible. I filed for work order on April 27th because the freezer stopped making ice. She followed up with me with a message and I answered her message that the freezer just suddenly stopped working. Then, she just forgot about this email. Now, without a question, if it's suddenly stopped making ice, a normal person would assume something went wrong with the freezer and cooler. However, this lady adressed that I didn't mention anything about the cooler not working. First, who would jump to conclusion immediately without analyzing for information. Second, she didn't want to admit it's her fault for not responding to my email and insisted that we have been communicating via emails, in fact, that didn't happen. Third, she gave me that BS of new construction so it's under warranty and they can't send their men into the unit. Moreover, I called today and brought up this again. The agent answered very unprofessional. \"We need name and address, that's more important\" with a terrible attitude and tone. Where's \"We are sorry that happened to you, can we please get a name and address?\" Even McDonald employees are more friendly than Landmark customer service associates. I don't know if we should stay with Landmark for future. This is just very bad experience and unprofessional working ethics from the employees. We are currently paying 3,800-4,000$+ a month for Landmark and for this price, the sastisfaction we received is low to terrible.\nIt's been 9 days of room temperature food. If anything happens, expect a lawsuit. We have plenty of time and resources to make sure that this is heard !",

Long story short, they are as unprofessional and crooked as the rest of the reviews say, even if they manage to put on a good face for a while.\n\nAfter signing a mutual lease termination in October, they allowed my ex-roommate to stay on the premises for an additional 45 days, during which time he didn't pay rent, utilities, or keep the place clean. At the time they told me not to worry about it, the lease termination meant I wasn't responsible for anything he did after.\nAfter they served him a pay or vacate notice he left, but the apartment was trashed. I offered to clean it up before they did the final move out, as I felt bad he'd been so irresponsible and appreciated what I thought was their help. They told me I wasn't allowed to go back and clean or repair anything because I terminated my lease months ago.\n\nThen, in March, about a week after I move out of the Tullwood apartments and am no longer a Landmark customer, they send me a $1500 bill that includes not only the rent and utilities my former roommate owed, but also all the damages and cleaning fees. That's $1500 AFTER my deposit, which I did not get back when the lease was terminated in October.\n\nThinking it was a misunderstanding, I called the office several times over the course of the week, and the property managers refused to take or return my calls. It was finally the accountant Rich who said that even with the lease termination I was still responsible for the charges, and to pay up or go to collections.\n\nWhat a nightmare.",

If you ever have to call to resolve an issue, you usually only get one call to the front desk before they recognize your number and stop picking up. Even when they do pick up, any time you need to speak to a manager/anyone with the authority to resolve your issue, that person always happens to be out of the office (convenient for them since the issues these individuals resolve typically come at a cost to the agency). On one occasion they pulled this routine of ignoring calls and claiming the property manager was out for lunch (at 3pm? Really?) for 3 weeks when my roommate was simply trying to get a refund because we had been double-charged for a $10 electric bill. They gave me the same go-round when I was trying to resolve an issue with the end of my lease. For weeks I called the office to inquire as to whether I would be given a partial refund for my rent payment for the month of November, given that I had committed to vacate by the 20th. All i wanted was to know if I would either receive said refund, or be given until the end of November to vacate. One final note is that, at the start of my tenure with them, they conveniently forgot the addendum on the lease that I sublet, which would state that the lease expires in November, and tried to wrangle my roommate and I into a year long commitment instead of the 3-month commitment we signed up for from the sub-letter. It took an actual visit from the sub-letter with a physical copy of the addendum in hand to overturn this mistake. Horrible, unethical, slimy company that I would advise any and all prospective tenants to avoid at all costs.",

We may get a copy of the bill, but that doesn't give us access to find out whether or not you've made a payment. We did make sure to rectify this, upon receiving all the necessary information.

First off their office is so unorganized that if you have any sort of paperwork that the needs to be taken care of it takes them days to process through it all. Secondly, the place that we currently live has needed so many maintenance issues updated on it that were supposed to be completed before we moved into the place. We've had our lease for about 5 months now and they still have yet to complete them all. On top of that there were minor issues that were submitted as maintenance requests, and when confronting them over several weeks later they denied ever receiving any requests. When asks when they would be able to send someone out they said that they had no idea and couldn't even give a time frame. I told them that this was unacceptable and we've been waiting for weeks to have several minor issues resolved (this would take an hour out of any maintenance persons day if even that) they got extremely defensive and then started being the most disrespectful to me for simply asking for a date to schedule a maintenance appointment. As someone who has worked retail for several years and seen a lot of bad customer experiences, this takes the cake as the worst customer experience ever. I will never rent from them again, and I would rate them 0 stars if that were an option.",

        "review": "Living in a rental property managed by Landmark has been a headache for almost 2 years- and we only rented with them for one!! It started when we had to sign a lease 6 months prior to moving in. They hiked the rent up by $100 in between paying the holding fee and signing the lease, they did not take care of the water bill prior to our move-in so we were constantly hours away from having our water shut off, and no one responds to emails/voicemails. Getting repairs done was a nightmare- I had to threaten legal action just to get running water and lights on in the house. We received erroneous bills in the mail which they would say were 'taken care of,' only to receive another bill plus late fee later. They are extremely unscrupulous about returning deposits. Legally they have 14 days to return your deposit so they send a letter stating they are holding your deposit for \"estimated\" charges. They claim you'll get it back once they receive receipts from their vendors. Good luck! You have to continuously call and email to get any response. I finally consulted a lawyer and I can't wait to be done with them.",

        "review": "CALL BEFORE APPLYING to check availability!!!! They leave taken units up after someone has put a holding fee down and let people apply for them, then send an email saying its unavailable but you can transfer your application to another listing (they will refuse to refund it even if the unit was not available at the time you applied even though they still had it listed). This can be good depending on if there are lots of  listings that appeal to you, however it seems to be a ploy to make people feel invested in Landmark and to then try to force themselves to find a place to apply to with Landmark. I applied to two unrelated units at 6-7pm, and 8:48 am got emails saying that both units had had holding fees placed on them.  I asked to know the exact time for the holding fee because one of the units had been listed for months untouched, so I found the timing a little suspicious that they had been taken overnight just like that. Additionally, they post new units usually when they are closed so you CAN'T call. You have to risk losing the unit by waiting till they open to ask about availability, or risk the wasted fee; they know what you will choose and are literally banking on it. They never got back to me so I can only assume that the listing were taken loooong before I ever applied. They even updated the availability date of on of the units to \"Available Now\" after they informed me it had been taken. EDIT: Further proof of this suspicion was confirmed when I saw the same taken apartment newly listed on FB marketplace 3 days after a I was informed a holding fee had been placed on it and they had stopped accepting applications on it.

I urge you to consider going to another leasing company for your apartment rentals/leasing if you plan on settling in the Bellingham area. I know most Yelp review pages for leasing companies will have negative reviews but I HIGHLY encourage you to read about my experience and consider going to another company when looking for Bellingham apartments/houses.\n\nWhen I moved into my apartment, I was appalled that they said that they cleaned and fixed the apartment. OK, I'm a pretty clean person but who says the apartment is considered fixed when there are holes punched into the door... Not only did we take photos of this but we reported this immediately to the leasing company and it took them 2-3 months for them to finally fix the doors.  \n\nNow, moving out I'm so appalled at this and to this day I am appalled. Our security deposit was around $800. We made sure the apartment was cleaned spotless, even better than when we moved in. Everything was fixed and tidy with no damages. We got back $24. All I said was \"LOL are you serious?\" I was so shocked at this. Did they change the carpets? Fix the blinds?  Redid the kitchen with this?!? We called so many times about this and they said they were going to look into this and we finally got an answer saying that there was damage to the apartment case closed. I'm so confused at this and still to this day as we left the apartment in better condition than before. In the end, fighting this for months after we moved out was not worth $300+ of my share of the deposit as we would always get told that a message will be taken and a call will never get returned to us...\n\nI've rented from now 5 places and this is by far the worst company I've ever leased apartments from. Even if you find the perfect apartment complex and it's through them, I want to urge you to find another place to rent from. If you choose to rent from Landmark, you better document everything with your phone (including photos and videos) of when you move in and out and ask for a final ledger upon move out. PLEASE PLEASE find another place. Now I know why the previous tenants left those holes in the apartment (see photos) and I would have probably done it too after all the frustration I faced leasing from Landmark.",

They had to get rid of that app within one year, but certainly didn't help those of us who were struggling.\nThe property is rundown. The rules about no smoking and pets are not enforced. There were bug problems that continued for several months. Smoke from neighbors smoking on their porches seeped into the apartment. There was a huge problem with the walkways along the 2nd story entrances. So many soft spots that I was concerned about dropping a foot through the walkway.  \nI think of all the time and all the phone calls I have made over the last year for different problems.\nThen, in the checkout process, we received approval to check out early. But this was never communicated to the Accounting department. So the Accounting department refused to honor the email approval we received from the property manager. We paid about $500 that they refused to refund.\n\nThis company seems very disorganized. And the employees do not seem very happy. Be very cautious if you decide to rent from them.",

        "review": "Do not be deceived by the seemingly nice properties Landmark owns. I have been a tenant with Landmark for about 7 months now. The entire experience has been nothing short of frustrating and overall exhausting. We will not be renewing our lease here when the lease is up.\n\nI do not know where to even begin with these people. The property manager we deal with is Grace Macdonald. Both room mate and I have not liked this lady from the get go. We moved to Bellingham with the hopes of finding something nicer than our old place and we settled for the place we have now with Landmark. The apartments themselves are decent and fairly new, but the management makes it so that the apartment quality isn't even worthwhile.\n\nLet us start with how unprofessional the landlord is. Every other day or so, we get texts that sound like a third grader wrote them. We have been asked to basically spy on our neighbors and be snitches on each other for Grace. Everything, from literal begging and pleading, to how to park cars etc, is texted about all the time. It seems as though she cannot properly manage her property well at all. Do not think any complaints or maintenance you have will be handled at all. We have been waiting for our washing machine to be fixed for four months now. Still nothing from them. We have neighbors above who stomp louder than elephants and we were essentially told to suck it up when we asked if they could message the people about sound etiquette. But only week one into our stay and we already had Landmark messaging us to be more quiet.\n\nThe apartments are nice... in the winter and winter only. They are equipped with heaters in all rooms. But in the summertime, these apartments will make you feel like you are in a slow cooker. NO AC whatsoever. Be prepared to drop $400 on an AC unit for your place. The apartments are on the expensive end. 2 bed and 1 bath is close to $2000 every month, including all utilities. We are broke. the bedrooms are also small as hell. The security deposits and pet fees are outrageous too! Each cat is $500 and an additional $40 every month to your already ludicrously expensive rent.\n\nThere are no amenities at all. No covered parking, no garages, no pool, no gym, no clubhouse. You get the idea. What you DO get offered by Landmark is a gardening plot and paid parking spots. But, as the name suggests, they are paid for monthly. So, in addition to expensive rent, you can pay $60/month for a parking spot no closer than 95% of the parking and $30/month for a box of dirt. Money greedy.\n\nBottom line, living here has felt like being watched over by the Gestapo - Landmark cares solely about money and making their tenants miserably controlled. Never renting from these people again.",

Well over 21 days passed and no deposit or statement of fixes was given. When I inquired after a couple months, they sent me a check for just over $10.00. I followed up with a demand letter for entire deposit citing the RCW they were blatantly attempting to violate, they refunded the full deposit within one week.\n\n2. When moving out of our last place after buying a home, I wanted to make sure they still had the move in inspection form we signed; they legally need to have a copy on file to be able to keep some/all of a damage deposit and they also are legally required to provide a tenant one copy when asked during that tenants tenancy.\n\nWhen we asked for a copy, we were told it wasn't available, it was filed away in storage off site, they had switched from paper files to digital since we moved in and they may not have it at all and they'd have to get back to us a different day, etc. After a rather large commotion and being threatened to have the cops called on us for harassment because we knew exactly what we were entitled to (we actually offered to call our family friend for them who is a sheriffs deputy on duty at the time, they declined) they conveniently sent over the electronic pdf of the document via email within literally 21 minutes of us leaving the office. Very impressive if it was indeed a hard copy only stored offsite like they stated. \n\nThere were some other instances of subpar property management, but these two situations told me everything I need to know about how they do business. There is a reason they are one of the worst reviewed property management companies in Whatcom county.",

I applied on May 25th and did not get an approval until 6/24 to get keys THE NEXT DAY.  I had spent weeks asking for updates so I would know whether to start cleaning and packing.  Their stupid online application system makes it very difficult when getting an ESA animal approved...even though my dog had lived with me on an approved status for the last year!

The whole thing was NOT my fault.\n\nAnd then....with 5 days to move in record setting heat wave, I asked for an additional couple days to have a hidebed couch taken out by Habitat for Humanity.  They gave me until July 1st.  Not helpeful.  It is 8/21/21 today and my old apartment still sits empty.\n\nThen they charged me 6 additional days of rent in July as well as 8 hours of cleaning!  They place was awfully cleaning but for some cleaning residue and a few bits on debris on the floor that likely blew in as they opened the door!  \n\nI disputed the refund amount and got back half of what I was asking for accompanied by a bitchy email from Cherise.

They will fix little things in a reasonable time frame, but anything else takes weeks or doesn't happen. \n\nThey charge fees for everything. Be mindful of every entry because they frequently over charge.

They charge many in   \"error\" and include a \"service fee\" for their entry of the initial fee being charged. The entry fee is only $3, but it's still frustrating to be changed a fee for them to enter a fee.\n\nWater management is also really sketchy. There's only one meter on the our four-plex, so they charge a \"water fee\" and divide the bill based on square footage and number of people in the house, but will routinely \"miscalculate\" and overcharge. Ex: We were charged $136 for one month of use in our apartment, and when we asked if we could see the bill they said \"no\", but noted that they had overcharged, and then lowered the fee to $90. We've since asked to see the bill on three additional occasions and they've said \"no\". \n\nWe will avoid renting with Landmark in the future.",

This enthusiasm for this company has quickly faded as each encounter we have had with them has been both frustrating and the staff have proven to be disingenuous. \n\nWhen asked to fix the collapsing counter in our apartment, we were told that it would be taken care of. On further inspection after it was \"fixed\" screws had been put into the base of the counter, but weren't actually attached in place to keep it steady. On first glance it looked as if it was fixed when actually no support had been given at all.\n\nAs a company, Landmark has proven time and time again that it does not care for its tenants. Every exchange through this company has been through text, impersonal, and has always included a threat. When trees were being taken down in the northern parking lot, instead of being asked to move our cars we were simply informed that if they weren't moved by the next day they would be towed. \n\nAlthough that example might seem pretty innocuous, it's a behavior that is repeated almost every time we have any interaction with them. When rent was due recently, my account that is set on autopay originally took the money from my account, but bounced it from the system the same day. Instead of alerting me to this by email, call, or text, Landmark instead taped an eviction notice to our door. Once I fixed this error with rent we were then slapped with a fee of over $100. Now while I understand the fee the real frustration has come from trying to talk to staff at Landmark.\n\nCustomer service has been unhelpful and more willing to threaten tenants than actually provide a semblance of sympathy. I know I can't tell anyone where to rent from, but my experience here has been incredibly disappointing.",

They will definitely try to overcharge you/ charge fees and not even tell you.\n\nFor example, 3 people happened to move out around the same time, and getting the 3 new housemates on the lease has taken an eternity and required us to constantly badger Landmark over the phone, because they haven't told us when something needs to be submitted like 3 separate times now. After weeks of waiting with no word from Landmark, we just now learned that there was a form we were supposed to submit that no-one knew about. (They didn't bother emailing it until 3 weeks after the new roomies moved in). This was after we had been assured weeks prior by Landmark that the process was done on our part & it just had to go through their system (they told us this multiple times).\n\n This one example is just the tip of the iceberg. The property itself is decent (although the appliances are ancient & it was clearly built on the cheap), but Landmark's internal machinery is incredibly slow & often doesn't work.

Many units are not properly labeled (some will be labeled as \"studio\" but you WILL be sharing everything!!!!) and parts of the website say \"pets OK\" and some parts say no pets (I have screenshots of this). Horrible photos are presented of the older units, and many units are masked with the caption \"*Note: Photos may not depict exact unit(s) available\".  How do I know what I am applying for?? I live out of the state and find it completely unnerving that they do not feel the need to include actual photos. This company is a scam and a catfish. Do not let them take your $45 application fee, as they will run to the hills with it. I will never  forget about this terrible experience I have had with this company.

The units are clean and kept very well.  When I moved in, there were multiple minor issues that needed to be addressed including a broken exterior window in the master bedroom.  It took Landmark 2.5 months to have the glass replaced.\n\nWhen I moved out a couple of months ago, I cleaned the place spotless as expected and outlined in the lease agreement.  This was also noted by Landmark in the YouTube video they record while performing the move out inspection.  The only issue was noted as being some minor dust on the marble counter tops in kitchen and bathroom.  They ended up charging me a cleaning fee that was deducted from my deposit.\n\nLesson learned and bottom line (and what I have heard about all property management companies in Bellingham), be prepared as they will keep a portion of your deposit no matter what.

Once I called them out for it, they stopped billing me but took the $70 I had already paid them.

        "review": "I was a tenant at a landmark property from November 2020 to September 2021. I am absolutely appalled at what others, including myself, have been through in dealing with these sharks. First of all, the main office is ridiculously unresponsive and you have to call them seemingly dozens of times in order for them to even reliably pick up and answer your call, even during stated business hours. Secondly, the terms in our lease at Sophia Place were ridiculously unreasonable. They can (and will) nickel and dime you for everything they possibly can. Want a garden plot? $50 security deposit and then $30 a month. Paid parking? $60 a month for a spot no closer than 95% of the rest of the parking spots. Also, be prepared to empty your bank account if you have pets, and the deposits are NOT STATED on the website. In case anybody was wondering, it's $500 per pet for a security deposit followed by $40 a month thereafter per pet. Speaking of prices, the cost of rent is absolutely unaffordable. By the time we moved out, we were paying almost $2000 a month including utilities and pet rent and all of that jazz for our 805 square-foot apartment. The base rent for Sophia Place got jacked up as well. It used to be $1500 a month for ours, and if we hadn't moved out, it would have been $1605 a month. Also, they do not do month to month leases. So if your lease is about to expire and you can't find another place to go, tough luck, you will have to sign for another several months, if not a year. It's whatever they decide. Also, forget about getting your security deposit back. You will never see it again, even if you make your apartment shine brighter than the surface of the sun. The staff themselves are extremely rude and sound like they absolutely hate their jobs, and the ones that don't sound like they are very clearly faking a positive attitude. If you can, please find somewhere else to live in Bellingham. It's sad that seemingly every other property in that area is owned by Landmark so it doesn't give you many options. Don't do it. Just don't do it.",

We tried scheduling through their online system and all three times Landmark cancelled the viewings without telling us. That's right THREE TIMES. The first time, it seemed like an arbitrary mistake, it was fine. Turns out we didn't need a reservation and were told when we called to just pick up the keys. The second time however we waited at the house for nearly half an hour and nobody showed up. We called. Turns out it was a mistake on their end. The house is still occupied and they never notified the tenant that people would be coming by to view the house. They actually apologized that time and offered to reschedule us for today. We graciously accepted the apology. Hey mistakes happen. We had a VERY busy day today and made it back to Bellingham, sleep deprived, hot and anxious to see the house and lo and behold, we waited another 20 minutes. Nobody was there. We called and the person on the phone was rude to US and blamed us for cancelling the reservation. There is no way we could have. We made the reservation over the phone. The person kept talking over my fiance and offered no apology, solution or explanation beyond that if the tenant doesn't want to show the property, they don't have to. OKAY, but I thought you just told us that it was our fault? \n\nALSO the house looks totally trashed from the outside. There is definitely potential and it was in our price range, but the yard is an absolute WRECK. Nobody has maintained that yard in perhaps years.

I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to some of the office staff as most were having to work from home and for the most part, they were polite to me. \n\nMy husband and I were moving back to Bellingham after living abroad, and due to the virus, were not able to see a unit in person. The website made it seem as if all tours were virtual at this point. We saw the pictures of a like unit online, which in reality looked very little like the actual unit. We applied and submitted a holding fee. I was not thrilled about submitting a holding fee before seeing the unit in person, but I was under the impression only virtual tours were being done at the time. \n\nDespite turning a holding fee into the dropbox, when I finally got through to someone around a week later, I was informed that my deposit had not been received and the unit had been given to someone else who had put down a holding fee. I found the receipt number of the money order submitted and despite the office not recording it, they had cashed the check and taken my money. After a few days of sorting this debacle out, they found my payment, told the other person there had been a mistake and gave us first dibs on the unit. We scheduled a viewing of the apartment, to which no one showed up from the office. I got a text afterwards blaming it on car trouble. We saw enough of the unit through the windows to know that it was insanely overpriced for both the area and the quality of the unit. We were homeless at this point and began looking for other units with other companies. Despite the fact that we never actually signed the holding fee agreement and they had made so many mistakes along the way, we had to accept the fact that they pocketed about 400 dollars from us for doing nothing. They had not even processed our applications until about two weeks later. It appears from reading other reviews that this is a common occurance with this company and that the pandemic is a good cover for shady business practices. \nThank God, we came across a private landlord who had our applications processed and a background check done within two days and allowed us to move in. Processing applications does not have to take weeks, be unorganized nor require a middle man to get rich on ridiculous fees. I would advise against using this company, as I would against most property management companies, but if you have to choose, avoid Landmark.",

After reading some of the other reviews (http://g.co/maps/b9hv7), I'm pretty sure it's the same shitty company.\n\nDO NOT RENT FROM THESE CRIMINALS.\n\nI'm reaching into the past to write this review, but considering this shady outfit managed to screw up my credit for several years I think it's only fair...\n\nWhen myself and two other tenants moved out of a house managed by \"Property Management Professionals\" we were given a bill that stated not only were they taking the entire $1000 deposit for the rental but demanding a couple hundred more on top of it.  The itemized list of charges was laughable; this was for a crumbling old house that the landlords had put ZERO money into for years (broken cabinets, faulty fixtures, filthy carpets, etc. when we moved in) and really needed a complete remodel.  \n\nGranted, our use of the space had added to the wear & tear so using some of the deposit money for repairs and cleaning was entirely justified.  Hell, even if they had taken the entire $1000 for this purpose we would have been OK with that.  The problem was that they demanded MORE money and each of us refused to pay it.  They threatened to send me to collections over the bill, and when they did so I received a letter stating that I had 30 days to refute the charges in writing.  You bet your ass I refuted those charges!  Did me no good, though: after repeated attempts through both Property Management and the collection agency to explain the situation and go through the itemized list of charges line by line I was completely blown off and told that I'd better just pay up or sacrifice my credit.  This being my first experience in such a situation I didn't realize what a mess that was going to be so I stood on principle and refused to pay their extortion money.\n\nWell, several years later I've found that NOT paying the $200 or so that this company unfairly charged me with no recourse has probably cost me thousands of dollars due to a lower credit rating.  Thanks a lot, assholes.  I'll never have anything to do with these people again, and I'd urge anyone considering renting space in Bellingham to stay away from Property Management Professionals as well.",

BEWARE!\n\nI have been in property management in Seattle for over thirty years, and upon renting a house in the York district in Bellingham for my son and two friends I have encountered a truly unscrupulous business.  There is nothing good, fair, kind or ethical about Landmark Real Estate Management.\n\nPlease, when you move into a property take exact and perfect notes on your move-in/move-out documentation.\n\n   Carefully note the condition of the property upon moving in because if you don't you will be taken advantage of by a business that rents property in bad condition and then blames you for it upon move out.  Landmark will be keeping a $1,200 damage deposit and charges $400 for an elderly man to come mow the lawn for one hour and bills the tenant.  Granted, tenants should maintain the yard, but charging tenants about $200 each time for a lawn mow is highway robbery.\n  \nWhen I went to the managing office for Landmark to discuss these issues the general manager was no where to be found.  There was a young couple in the office suffering from the same problem - a property left immaculate and the damage deposit kept.\nI will be contacting an attorney and could care less what it costs.  These people have to be stopped. \n\nPlease, think long and hard before you use this company to obtain rental property.

        "review": "A one star review is generous. \n\nThough I thought I'd give yelp reviewing a go in the past, as evident by my one review, I gave it up - I didn't dig it that much. I feel this is a responsibility of mine however to divulge some interesting information and my experience with Landmark Real Estate Management.\n\nOur apartment complex, Civic Shield, was low end. We knew this heading in. It isn't flashy or particularly nice, fair. What we did not know was Land Mark's ramshackle performance of attending to our needs. \n\nUpon moving in the apartment wasn't even cleaned - we had to remind them of this. They sent a cleaning woman who spent a very reluctant twenty minutes at our apartment, repeatedly asking if she was done yet. She didn't do a great job.\n\nOur kitchen sink leaked profusely, and we had to have that fixed four separate times. Four times we had to have our master bedroom toilet repaired as well. The front bathroom sink needed replacing and the oven had to be fixed, and only one or two repairs were prompt or anywhere close. \n\nMost of this is excusable - apartment/renting stuff, no big deal right? I concur! What was problematic truly, though, was the insurgence of black mold. The apartment is built into the ground and in all of the rooms a bout of black mold started growing feverishly as soon as summer ended, and it was furious. We scrub it and use air filters and air out the room, but it comes back and back again. I believe this to mean there is mold in the walls, at least the foundation, and find this  unacceptable. To rent to people without proper inspection (giving them the benefit of the doubt here) is incorrigible. Landmark showed little to no interest in fixing this problem, but did manage to send a person to clean the mold a few times before finally using some sealant...on one part of the mold.\n\nMost disturbing is the following email, wherein I had recently called to let Landmark know that as they showed the apartment I would have no problem with letting potential renters know of my experience. Here is the response from my email, verbatum:\n\n\"If here is an issue with Landmark you need to come to us, not tell potential tenants about it. I have every maintenance request you submitted about the mold and every time we have addressed it properly and the way we are required to do so. It is not your place to tell anyone anything. Again, if there an issue you can address it with me in out office. If you have proof we never responded I need to see it in person. I have requests that show otherwise and I am more than willing to provide them to you. We have addressed all maintenance requests you have submitted. You are moving and it is not your place to tell anyone anything. Please provide me the proof that we don't respond. I know for a fact that maintenance is there right now fixing things because he just called me from there. I need the proof though please. You can drop it by the office by the end of today. I will gather our proof that we have and this will be discussed. Looking forward to meeting with you to review all of this.\"\n\nGranted I was incorrect in my assumption of there tardiness, apparently I miscounted, and we never did meet in person because of this realization on my part. There is no point in meeting to discuss their lack of haste and care for their poor property, but really what is interesting to me is \"It is not your place to tell anyone anything.\" Imagine if a burger place said, \"Here's your food, but it is not your place to tell anyone anything about your experience with our product.\"\nAgain stated later, \"You are moving and it is not your place to tell anyone anything.\"\nIt's like I rented from Bellingham's own mafia! Any ways, that's my soap box. Enjoy, rent wisely. They certainly are cheap, and we didn't die, so there's always that.",

From their point of view, every unhappy tenant is in the wrong, show Landmark even the slightest hint at your frustration, and they will break down and act like you are one hundred percent in the wrong and they should hold zero blame. Some examples to supplement my complete lack of faith for this company: Instead of handling late rent on a case by case basis and taking time to understand a tenants needs, this company has completely done away with a grace period due to the fact that in the past customers would always pay on the fifth. Great. Whatever. But when I pay my rent 24 hours late due to their servers not allowing my payment to go through, and I'm charged $134, that's absolutely ridiculous. They are also cutting a huge chunk out of our security deposit for an issue that was caused by previous tenants, and despite the fact that I sent in three maintenance requests throughout the year (all of which were ignored completely), I still get to pay for a problem that I can only help but think was charged to the last tenants security deposit to and they pocketed the money instead of using it to fix the problem.

        "review": "In short summary: NEVER RENT FROM LANDMARK. Landmark Real Estate Management has been completely unprofessional and negligent to my roommate and me over the past year that we have rented from them. \n\n1. Though their office is nice and the younger staff are friendly, the older women in the office are rude and their property managers are lazy. \n\n2. Upon moving into our apartment there were a host of maintenence items that should have been taken care of before we moved in. We listed these on our move in inspection and also filled out a maintenance report. In addition, the apartment was not cleaned properly. The bathroom had grime on the walls, toilet, and tub. The carpets were so dirty they filled up an entire vaccum bag. One of the locks on our front door would not work and our mail box was broken. My roommate found a comdom in the closet, along with other more minor issues. According to Washington State Rental Rights, the maintenance items should have been fixed within 10 days. It took over two weeks for only some of these issues to be fixed only after we contacted them multiple times about it. The other minor issues were never fixed because about a month after moving in we had a major issue...\n\n3. The whole ceiling above our shower began to get moldy incredibly fast. We would clean it properly but the mold wouldn't come out. We sent in another maintenance request and this time we had to send them a formal letter that they were breaching renters rights by not fixing it within 10 days (took over two weeks of multiple phone calls and office visits every few days with no response from our property manager). By then part of our ceiling needed to be replaced and the maintenance man cut a hole, filled it with plaster, and just left it like that. We had to contact them again so that he would come back and finish the job properly. It should not have taken over three weeks to fix a mold problem. Aparently it was caused by leaky pipes from the apartment above.\n\n4. With that ordeal settled it was a few months before we had another maintenance issue. My main point is that their communication and lack of response with tenants is extremely unprofessional and unneccisarily stressful for the renters involved. It seems like there should be a better way to communicate... like with phone calls and emails about progress or notification that they received the request and will fix something within a certain time frame... or something. \n\n5. More recently we received a notice to vacate within three days on our door. Both my roommate and I were gone at the time for the week so we did not receive the notice which was only sent by mail and door posting that was only accessible at the apartment that we weren't at. It seems like for urgent matters like these a phone call would be in order. The notice was for rent. Aparently their drop box was broken into on the day that rent was due and our cash and check (paid with both, yes we realize that part should not have been paid in cash, however it was a Sunday, banks were closed and one of us was out of checks that had not come yet in the mail). The more professional thing to do would have been to send out a notice to tennants that the drop box had been broken into and that they were investigating the situation. What they did was tell us we had to vacate over two weeks later and we didn't find out until three weeks later in a panic over a phone call that we made to them. After inspection their office does not have security cameras and they stated that they were not responsible for anything the public does on their property. Basically, if you use that excepted method of payment and it is breached, you're screwed! They said they put a notice out on Facebook. Why would we ever like their page after our first few experiences? In the end, since we chose to put cash money in the box that there is a note on warning not to put cash into, we decided it would be in our best interest financially to pay the extra stolen rent money instead of hiring an attorney and going to court. That's in addition to the stress caused to both of us who are students working hard to pay for school. Since my roommate's check was stolen, my roommate needs a new checking account. \n\n6. Needless to say, we have learned a lot from this experience and know what to look for in the future. We will do our best to spread the word around Bellingham and hope you do too. \n\nCheers! :D",

        "review": "This isn't a blatant five star review, they actually deserve all five from my experience with them. I would have given them a four star review, but the last month and a half they have been bending over backwards to accommodate my needs.\n\nLandmark took over the property I am renting about eight months ago. For years I was trying to get the former property management to clear the trees and ivy and blackberry bushes from around my deck. It's a second story deck and in the summer it was unusable due to the overgrowth. They didn't do anything about it and I figured the new management (Landmark) wouldn't care either. Let's face it, most property management companies aren't really in the business of spending money to fix things; it cuts into their profit I guess. I made the call anyways figuring it was the responsible thing to do, and if it destroys the deck at least the blood won't be on my hands. A week later I got home from work and I could actually see my deck! I walked out onto it and they had cleared the growth back 15-20 feet! It might not sound like much, but this was full grown trees and blackberries that hadn't been touched in about 4 years. If you've been around blackberry bushes at all, you know how much damage they can do if unattended for a few years.\n\nAnother example is that I had a dishwasher and a range that were not functioning properly. Again, multiple calls to former management and finally someone came to look at it (entered without knocking....grrrr) and he said that I needed a new range and that they probably wouldn't get me one. Whatever, I just used the two functioning eyes on the stove. A few months ago I mentioned it in passing to Landmark (we were talking about something else, can't remember what) and they said they would look into it. Two days later someone comes out and fixes both items in about 30 minutes. He was confused as to why I didn't say something about it earlier...\n\nWhich leads me to this: Should a renter be amazed when a property management company does the job that they are supposed to do? Of course not. BUT, that's the way it is. I've been renting from different property managers for 25 years in three different cities and none of them have ever been so prompt and responsive about dealing with complaints. It really floored me. \n\nSo, there's the four stars. I think they deserve that for being better than the others, and for being prompt.\n\nThe final star is for the two months of me trying to move out and having problems with the place I'm supposed to move into. I gave notice, then had to extend my notice. They were completely accommodating and friendly. They put it on the market and found a renter who was supposed to move in. I had to extend my notice AGAIN. Again, they were accommodating and helpful. Then, guess what? Another extension! This time they had to work with the person who was supposed to be moving in. Totally polite and kind. Totally helpful. (Special thanks to Joy!)\nThis was completely over the top in what they HAD to do. They didn't have to help me out and I didn't actually expect them to. Legally or morally.\n\nTL;DR\nThese guys did flips and cartwheels for me when they didn't have to.\nWould rent from them again.",

I have called multiple times and been givin the run around and put on hold. I cant imagine how long it would take them to fix a problem at a property. Whether or not my application goes through i will not rent from them. I read some reviews before applying and figured id still give them a shot. DONT MAKE THAT MISTAKE!",

        "review": "The people in the office are nice, and my landlord wasn't absolutely terrible even though she was kind of mean, but there seemed to be really bad communication between the office, the landlord, and the landlord's assistant.  I found someone else to take over the lease, and she applied at least two months ago and still hasn't gotten onto the lease.  This was partially because her old landlords were difficult to get a hold of, but it also doesn't sound like they've been very good at staying in contact with her about that even though the landlord called me saying they hadn't been able to get a hold of her and was kind of threatening and mean when I talked to her on the phone.  My roommate talked to the landlord's assistant, but then it didn't seem like the landlord had heard anything about their conversation.  Since they couldn't get a hold of her most recent landlords, she submitted a cosigner application about a month ago and they still haven't processed it.\n\nThe main thing that bothers me is that I thought I had signed a lease extension form (and it turns out I had) and I went to landmark's office to talk to them about getting off of that, but they said they didn't have any record of me signing that form and that they just had a note on our place saying not to advertise yet but nobody signed onto the lease for next year and that I didn't have to worry about it.  When my landlord called me I told her this, but she said that she did have the lease extension form that I had signed.  Now I have to advertise for someone to take over in two months and I don't even know if they'll be able to get onto the lease in that long of a time.  It's a good thing I talked to my landlord or I wouldn't have even known that I needed to find someone to take over.  Really frustrating.  I know that this isn't all Landmark's fault, but a good chunk of it is.",

        "review": "I have had a terriable experience leasing from them. One when I moved in the place was trashed and when I say trash imean hair, soap bars and a clogged drain, drier broken and filled with lent. Also, I got varied information about parking when i moved in like its free parking with permit, you get 3 spits which were both inaccurate. Secondly the property manager took over 2 weeks to respond to question on the bill. Also they towed my car because I accidentally parked in the stall next to mine without calling and my permit was clear were it could of been seen and it had was late at night and the numbers are very faded. Which still doesn't make sense since over half the lot is unoccupied yet they make many tenets park on some hill. The list goes on like I have repeatedly put in forms for the heater to be fixed and still nothing, it has been 2 months! This place is horrible and hard to work with. When you have a question they give you indirect answers.  When my car was towed they gave me an invalid number and I had to look it up to find my car!!! Not at all a place to lease through especially young college kids they will rob you, praying on your inexperience of renting just like they did to me and my roommates!",

        "review": "If I could pick zero stars I would.  This company is the most unprofessional, unqualified company I've ever attempted to communicate with.  Rude.  The management of my daughters apartment changed hands and they never informed me, the payer of the rent and co-signer, that they were changing.  They had my email address and never had a problem taking my money, but when I called to ask why we were delinquent on the payment to another company they at first told me they had no record of me or my daughter in their database.  On my insistence, she then found us in \"history\".  I asked if she could send me an email with the new management company information and contacts and she straight up told me \"NO\" she would not do that.  She said if I want any information I would need to wait until her manager came in or leave a voicemail.  Really?  You transferred my contract with you and then refuse to send me an email to give me the information?   This is only the recent frustration.  This apartment had broken lights, broken toilet and bug infestation when my daughter moved in.  They did manage to fix the light, but the bugs are so disgusting my daughter will often times will come to my house to spend the night even though we have to continue to pay rent.   DO NOT RENT FROM THEM",

        "review": "I am warning you, DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE. My boyfriend and I live in the Southgate apartments which are managed by landmark. We rent a 2 bedroom apartment and were promised 2 parking spaces, for 6 months we parked in our assigned spots and had no problems. In January more people starting moving in, and there for the parking lot got more full (the parking lot doesnt have enough spaces for tenant capacity) and we were told that they  finally had parking permits and to come pick them up. I went to get our 2 passes and they had the nerve to tell me that they \"reworked some things\" and now one bedroom and 2 bedroom apartments only get 1 spot and the 3 bedrooms get 2 parking spots. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO ANYONE?! There is no guest parking, no street parking, and literally no where else to park our other car. I mention that to them and the property manager tells me \"some people dont even have a spot, you should be thankful you have 1\" well b**tch our lease says exactly \"the tenant in allowed to have 2 cars on the premises\" so not only did they break there lease, but our other car has to be parked almost a half a mile away!! I have never dealt with more inconsiderate people and not to mention they never call back when you call them and one time I waited over a month for maintenance to finally come fix things for me, and I had to put in THREE maintenance request before they got around to doing anything. Im gonna say it one more time DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT",

          "text": "Hi Jordan, this is Candace, the property manager of Southgate apartments, I wanted to thank you for your feedback and I am deeply sorry for the inconvenience around the parking at Southgate.\n \nAs you know, parking is limited at Southgate, after tenant complaints and confusion over who parks where, we are switching to assigned parking with permits.  When we did an audit of our current parking, we discovered that tenants in 1 and 2 bedroom units had been assigned several parking spots that were assigned to vacant 3 bedroom units. Therefore, we are reshuffling things to ensure that all our tenants have access to at least one parking space.\n \nPrior to making this change official, we made efforts to inform our current tenants about the change with a notice in October of the initial audit and again in December of the final change. Both notices contained information on the reduction of parking for 1 & 2 bedrooms and the alternative location to park on Byron Street.\n \nAs for maintenance, we are constantly working to ensure tenants would continue receiving timely maintenance services.\n \nWe are working hard at Southgate to make it an enjoyable place to live. Change is not always an easy thing to endue however sometimes it is necessary to improve situations.\n \nWe hope that you understand that these changes will improve customer service to our valued tenants.\n \n-Candace"

        "review": "Stay away from this company. My daughter had to put a deposit down sight unseen for an apartment yet the actual apartment was more dated & in need of serious tlc. It was to have been ready days before we moved in & they were still working on it when we started moving it. The place was half painted & filthy. The carpet was so disgusting, even after supposedly being cleaned that I refused to allow my daughter to be responsible for cleaning carpets that needed to be replaced & could never just be cleaned. The carpet looked 20 years old. Ridiculous. So I got into it w/ the general manager & threatened legal action. My daughter was starting school the following week & we had signed ( I cosigned) months prior so finding another place on such short notice was not realistic. So she gave me a waiver, in writing, that she would not be charged for the carpet cleaning. Make no mistake, the place was not clean, non-working fan,lights, and a heat register as well as the toilet not flushing. I documented everything, first on the move in list then in an email to the general manager  & of course dozens of pictures. The maintenance man fixed the heater, the fan & the toilet after several weeks but nothing else got done. We did the cleaning ourselves. My daughter was nicely ensconced into school & couldn't be bothered chasing him down & asked me just to give up. So disgraceful. The complex was not maintained & it's a skating rink when it snows. Lawsuit waiting to happen. And they let just anyone rent from them from potheads to heavy partiers. 8 months in they want her to sign another contract for another year lease & when she didn't commit, they started showing her unit w/ often times less that 24 hours notice twice a week for about a month straight before I gave them notice that they were affecting my daughters enjoyment & per WA State law, they were abusing their right to enter. In every situation w/ these people, you will need to send any communication certified. Fast forward, they renter her place out, upon moving out, we took many pictures. The place was much cleaner when she moved out than in. Along w/ the keys, I included her forwarding address along w/ the reminder that she had a waive on the carpet cleaning. After several calls,, she finally got a walk thru. The employee acknowledged that the unit was cleaner than on move in, that they had recieved her forwarding address as well as her permanent (my) home address & that they were fully aware of the carpet cleaning waiver. Two weeks later, no deposit. After almost 3 weeks, she gets the deposit- the apt # was not on the envelop-you have got to wonder if it was on purpose- & it was mailed out the very last day it legally could be. Alas, they charged her for the carpet cleaning AND the lightbulb that they NEVER replaced & were told about 3 times claiming there wasn't a maintence request put in for it-insane! So of course I'm furious, I leave them a very heated message about how they failed to address the envelope containing her \"partial\" deposit, that the lightbulb WAS reported & that we verified ALL was aware of the carpet cleaning waiver. My daughter gets a condescending \"I don't give a s$@t\" response from a Casey claiming the lightbulb was on us & they needed a copy of the waiver as well as the request in writing. I was not amused. I dropped off a copy of all & sent a very pointed email to this Casey- no response, of course. It will be a week tomorrow & if she doen't have the balance of her deposit by Monday, I'm filing is small claims. Because what they're doing is considered \"bad faith\" in legal terns, not only will I go after the balance ( I really think they didn't think that I still have my copy of the waiver, but hell, they could just be really flipping incompetent) but all of my costs doing business w/ these jokers thus far w/ my certified mailings as well as court costs & I'm going to ask the judge to use their discretion & fine them the full extent of the law. I'm very aware of their reputation as there is a long line of previous Landmark Realty (they also used to call themselved PMP- more terrible reviews using that name as well) tenants who have sought out the help of the local Tenant Clinic so if any of you out there are wanting to join in a  class action type of small claims case, feel free to email me @ drobnson14@aol.com because in 5 days, I'll be filing. I have dealt w/ my fair share of slumlords in my life, but this group takes the prize.",

I waited 30 minutes and she never showed, forcing me to drive to the office to turn in the keys. Three weeks later I received $1300 dollars in fees for various false claims. The inspection report they filled out by their employees, without my presence, was completely false. I repainted over half the apartment because I lived there 8 years and they were faded and ugly, then they stated the walls were dirty. If you rent from them take pictures,v save them and document everything. This company are crooks in the business of screwing their tenants. Cover cover your ass or you'll be posting on of these as well. And forget about maintenance requests, that's not in their job description and they conveniently don't keep documentation that doesn't financially benefit them, that's the tenants job.

A common complaint involves long wait times for responses to maintenance requests, which can lead to tenant frustration.

Several tenants reported receiving minimal refunds or being charged for alleged damages that they disputed, asserting that the properties were left in excellent condition. Complaints about receiving cumulative charges for normal wear and tear were prevalent, with some residents expressing frustration over the difficulty in reclaiming these deposits. This lack of accountability has created a troubling perception of Landmark, with some users even threatening legal action to recover their money. Such patterns of behavior suggest a troubling trend that potential tenants should be wary of before committing to a lease.</p></section>"
