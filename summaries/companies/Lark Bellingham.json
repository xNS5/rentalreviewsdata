I think some of the managers are not the kindest or easiest to work with, they are sales people, but over all, I cannot imagine living anywhere in Bellingham after living in such a beautiful community.",

      "review": "I wish there was a zero star...alas but I have to give one.  My son lived there for a year.  Early spring before move out in August he kept getting hammered to sign a lease for the next year.  He did so and then they told him he did not qualify without a co-signer.  I got an email to co-sign for him.  I called them in less than 24 hours after he signed and asked that it be cancelled as he did not qualify and I was between jobs at that time and was not in a position to co-sign and I felt like he could do better than the outrageous rent he was paying there.  The person I spoke with said no problem it would be cancelled.  I again asked, \"so I will not be getting a final fee for this at move out?\"  Rep--\"oh, definitely not m'am we will tear it up\".  Even though I provided multiple emails and told them about this conversation I had to pay over 500 bucks or they were going to turn him and myself into collections.  They also charged for an HDMI cord that never existed.  Run, don't walk, away from this place.",

      "review": "Please be wary of the pressure tactics used by NXNW on these young inexperienced college students.  My child was high pressured into re-signing a lease for another year thinking there was a way to easily back out.  The price was hiked up without his knowledge as well.  There is NO CANCELLATION POLICY once you sign a rental agreement.  NO WAY OUT.  As the guarantor (I pay the rent, not my kid), I was contacted by email AFTER the 72 hour period where we could have legally gotten out of the contract, asking me to sign the new lease, which I find very suspicious.  The staff was very friendly when it came to seducing us on leasing an apartment last August for the first time but, now, after my child unwittingly renewed the lease and we notified them of the misunderstanding, their \"customer service\" took a complete 180 degree turn.  NXNW is owned by a large corporation and staff has obviously been trained in this strategy of high pressure sales and retention, then once a contract is signed, they behave with complete inflexibility if a misunderstanding has occurred in dealing with the young and inexperienced tenants.",

Not only are there various amenities at our disposal, but all students can ride the shuttle bus back and forth from school, saving $$ on transportation. the free coffee in the game room is a nice addition.

      "review": "Be extremely cautious when trying to rent a unit from them!\nI'm currently locked into a contract with them even though they refuse to allow me to rent due to a past missed payment on an old electric bill from years ago, which has already been paid for. I told them, after months of trying to move past that issue and trying to find alternative routes to rent the room (their only other options were to get another person to guarantor me or guarantor with a sketchy 3rd party, neither of which were an option for me), that I was no longer interested in renting with them if they were going to make things so needlessly complicated. Their response was that I needed to find a new person to take over my lease (I have NEVER in my life ever heard of this practice when renting from an apartment before.)\n\nFrom what I've been told by my partner, who I was going to room with, was that spot has already been taken over by a new person, and they were able to do it relatively quick too. If you guys can fill a room yourselves no problem, then why do you make the potential renters take on the responsibility once they sign a lease and can't move in? It doesn't make any sense.\n\nNow, I'm getting past due rent reminders every so often, stating that I owe thousands of dollars worth of rent for an apartment that I was never even able to get in the first place. It's complete madness. This was even after I got a hold of management and tried to sort out the rent due issues. It's been nothing but phone tag, being forgotten about, and being ignored by them countless times. \n\nBesides that headache, every time I've gone to visit my partner at this place last summer, there seems to be problems. He can almost never find a decent parking spot during certain hours and has to resort to parking at Fred Meyer (which they eventually wrote a letter to their tenants saying that they were no longer allowed to park there, leaving many to park outside the gates sometimes), there are sometimes MOUNTAINS of trash piled up outside the waste bins, other tenants are loud and party during the odd hours of the night and there's animal waste everywhere.\n \nIf they treat potential renters this unfairly, I can only imagine what people who have lived here long term must experience. \n\nMaybe just look elsewhere.",

      "review": "My roommate and I will be going on our second year living here and the only reason we renewed our lease is because we were told if we did (very early and months in advance) that our rate would stay the same as we had a discounted rate for applying when we did. Our rent was increased by 30$ with no notice or explanation.\n\nWhen you move in lark says a cleaning company comes into the unit and cleans it, this is either the worst cleaning company ever or a bald faced lie. there was dust everywhere, the bathroom was disgusting and the floors. THE FLOORS. I had to get on my hands and knees and scrub them for hours. After going over them maybe 3 times the water kept coming back disgusting. Due to the color of them you can't see the dirt but trust me it's there. My bathroom door is missing a latch strike plate (I think thats what it is) also the rubber that separates my carpet from the living room constantly comes off and isn't attached. \n\nThe apartment two floors below me consistently has EXTREMELY loud parties at 2-6 am and when I've emailed and submitted noise complaints I have gotten absolutely ZERO response. Anytime I try to contact them they are extremely unresponsive and don't actually help with anything. \n\nSomeone literally got shot amongst other things/ injuries that happened at a raging party and they literally did nothing. Some of our friends literally had people begging to come through their window because they were running from the party. They sent out a crappy letter that addressed nothing and then they got the cops called on them AGAIN at another party and all lark did was take away our gate code which just caused a million more problems and inconveniences than it solved. I think they did end up moving out but they should have been evicted immediately after the first incident.\n\nThe parking is an absolute nightmare. You pay 45$ a month for a \"reserved pass\" to park in the reserved spots and so you're \"guaranteed a spot\" and yet when people with the resident passes park there they do NOTHING. AND if you get home after like 8pm good luck finding a spot anywhere near your building if at all. If I had known parking was just a free for all I wouldn't have paid the 45$ and just parked wherever I wanted because apparently that's ok. Apparently we are getting assigned spots for reserved people. Excited to see if I get a spot anywhere near my unit. \n\nWe were having problems with our circuits and our breaker would flip up to 8 or 9 times in a night and we requested maintenance many times and he was the most unhelpful unknowledgeable man ever. It took like 3 months for them to finally get someone who was able to help us identify and fix the problem. (We also weren't the only people with breaker issues) \n\nNot to mention the washer and dryer included in the unit are absolute trash. My clothes have been pilling so badly and it's really ruining the quality of them. The dishwasher isn't great either. Yes it's nice to have them included but I  just thought for how much we are paying my clothes wouldn't be getting ruined and my dishes would be clean. I also had to unclog my own sink and fix my garbage disposal with my dad on the phone. gross. \n\nWhen we moved in we had issues with our wifi and lark was no help, they just told us to go to xfinity and figure it out ourselves. When we finally got it figured out and got a new modem a couple weeks later lark had these incredibly large and inconvenient boxes put into all the units to replace the nice small one we had before and the wifi is worse than it was before. Also getting a device put onto the wifi is now a bigger annoying process that you have to go through the website to do. \n\nUnfortunately the apartment below us caught on fire a couple months ago and luckily everyone was ok. The only issue is the fact that there are people doing construction from 6 or 7am until literally 11pm. Frequently. And its been happening for a while I'm not sure how they aren't done yet. \n\nThe garbage is also an issue. It's like they don't know how many people they have living here and how to accommodate correctly. The garbage spills out of the compactor a lot into a big pile and once I was taking my garbage down and since the thing was full there was a huge pile so I put my garbage on the pile as it was the only place to put it and someone on a golf cart came around and told me \"we don't leave our garbage on the ground here\" um sir where else should I put it. I'm not going to just leave it in my apartment until you decide to take care of it. \n\nThey are pet friendly but in the pet contract it says you have to declaw your cats which is not only incredibly inhumane but just messed up. I obviously did not declaw my fur babies and I'll gladly pay for a new, sh*tty couch, if need be. \n\nOne of my friends worked for them for a while and said they've already been reported to the better business bureau multiple times. Speaks for itself. \n\nSo yea, I don't recommend living here.",

      "review": "Where do I even begin--Lark seems nice at first glance, just like how any place that calls themselves \"luxurious\" should look like. They draw you in with fancy amenities, spacious rooms, their location being close to the WWU campus, etc. That's all a faade for how horrible this company is at managing a so-called student living complex.\n\nLet me start off that when I moved in, I put in a roommate application saying I would prefer to live with someone who is female and generally keeps themselves and their living environment clean. What did Lark match me with? The exact opposite. They assigned me a male roommate, when I explicitly said that I only wanted to live with females and living with a male would make me uncomfortable. My male roommate was also extremely unhygienic and incompetent, since he didn't seem to know how to pick up a broom and sweep the floor.\n\nWhen I first moved in, he was already living there for a year prior. The place stunk with a foul stench, the kitchen was horrendously dirty, and the floors were unable to walk on barefoot due to how much grime was covering the floor. When I arrived at my bedroom space, the toilet was covered in dried up urine, the carpets weren't vacuumed and I didn't even have a screen installed to my window. I thought to myself, this is what I'm paying close to $900 for each month? In this kind of living condition? And Lark didn't even do anything about it.\n\nAlso they invade your space every week or so, emailing you that they'll be doing some sort of \"maintenance\" that involves trespassing into your apartment. Also, if no one is home, they'll just barge in anyways. Isn't that illegal or something for landlords to enter into your place without your permission? Whatever.\n\nGood luck trying to break your lease if you don't want to pay upwards of $2,500 to mitigate the loss on their end. For a place that calls themselves student living, they're not very accommodating to their own residents, whom they know are college aged and have issues pertaining to life circumstances, ESPECIALLY during COVID-19 where students would rather live with their families instead of their disgusting roommates.\n\nMy roommate left me with a giant mess to clean up on my own. The absolute worst experience with a roommate I've ever had--and that's on Lark for assigning him to me.\n\nI didn't have an issue with parking spaces as I always had a spot close to my building, but that's probably due to not enough people living inside the units. I've walked past several ground floor units where the bedrooms are not occupied, which tells me they're struggling to find gullible students to fill in the spots.\n\nLark is so desperate for new residents that they've contacted people on instagram via direct messages that have \"WWU\" in their bio and ask if they're interested in signing a lease with them. They've also emailed residents and offered free items, food and accommodations to those who leave good reviews on google. How disingenuous and pathetic.\n\nDon't forget the absolute ridiculous astounding charges they slap you with after you move out--either pay those soon or they'll send you to collections! I left my apartment cleaner than when I moved in and they still charged me over a whopping $250 for a \"deep clean of the kitchen & living room\" even though I cleaned that place spotless before I moved out.\n\nThey also charged me well over $150 to \"repaint\" all the holes from tacks in the walls even though I had hung up one poster and the rest of it was already there from the previous tenant. All Lark does is charge their residents for maintenance, cleaning, and repairs and then don't actually repair or clean the place at all. They just pocket the money.\n\nThe only good thing about Lark is the student-led staff in their main office--they're somewhat kind and accommodating to your questions and concerns, but the other managers are a nightmare.\n\nDO NOT live here--even if it's your last choice. Just like everyone else who left a nasty review, this place deserves ZERO stars. Avoid this place like the plague, or reap the consequences.",

      "review": "I wrote a review on here a year ago and took it down because I wanted to give them a chance to turn things around for my second year of leasing since there was a major staff change. I'm not surprised at all that very little has changed.\n\nLet me just start by saying Lark Bellingham totally takes advantage of college students. The marketing is aggressive, they prey on you through social media (AND I was even told that they use social media to match roommates together - which is completely unethical). The system of renting through individual leases is just one of the many loopholes this place uses to abuse tenant's rights and unfortunately, many college students are just trying to get their first place on their own so we fall victim to it.\n\nMy first year here parking was a nightmare. I would get home late from work and have to park at Fred Meyer when it was very dark outside and walk over because there wasn't a single spot available. This is how they get you to pay the extra $40 a month for a Reserved spot. I witnessed so many college students get towed for parking at their own apartment complex. This year, I gave in on paying for a spot only to have nothing enforced and lots of parking available since there were so many vacancies during the pandemic. I could have saved thousands of dollars on this pass. \n\nThe \"security\" does not exist. Wait... let me correct myself. They do exist, but they sleep on the job and can't actually respond to calls about safety. Yes, I witnessed a security guard sleeping in their car last year after cars were broken into. \n\nThere was a good month and a half where my packages would continually \"go missing\" since they are delivered to the office and not straight to our door. The old manager here tried to convince me I was lying and then 2 weeks later my package magically reappeared. \n\nWhen it came to having roommates on this individual-lease system, I got completely screwed over. My old roommate worked for the complex and told me many times that she would be the one picking my roommates for this year, told us that she memorized our phone numbers, and would speak poorly of other staff members and residents while in our unit. I ended up being alone this year after I raised concerns about my safety given that my privacy was violated, but now only 4 weeks from me finally moving out of this place, I received 6 days notice that I would be getting a roommate and only 17 hours notice that someone would be entering my apartment the following day. The staff was nice enough to follow the law and wait until 24 hours+ to enter after I raised my concerns, but did nothing about giving me very little time to make arrangements for the person moving in with me. \n\nThe new staff members are very kind and try their best to be helpful, but it seems like they don't really have the right training to provide guidance to residents. I feel bad for them because it really isn't their fault, but it's also difficult to be paying $800+ to live here and not have great resources when it comes to the leases and issues with the space.\n\nAlso, be aware if you move here that the power seems to go out more than anywhere else I've ever lived. So stock up with flashlights and portable chargers. \n\nOh, and they bribed residents with pizza if they left a good review for them on Google.\n\nI will also add that all the responses from Scion seem to just be trying to delegitimize the negative experiences shared by other residents.",

      "review": "Edit: I - like my husband - do not answer to my legal name and thus do not have my legal name listed through my account. I have emailed Scion to clear this up. Haven't heard back from them at all. My roommate has also been trying to pay for damages and get some disputes resolved for a month now and has yet to have them resolved, which has prevented us from finding a new place to live. \n\nI lived here for two years. During that time, the office staff was transphobic, incompetent, and rude. They often misgendered my husband and called him by the wrong name, even after multiple attempts to correct them. One of the staff there, Selena, was particularly malicious and seemed to make it her personal mission to make our living experience there terrible. Throughout our every experience with her, she never once showed my husband any ounce of respect in his gender identity. Keep in mind, he goes by his middle name. It is LEGALLY his name. There is no excuse for their dismissiveness on our request that he be called by the correct name.\n\nOnce, he ordered something online and though he knew it was there, office staff insisted it wasn't. He had ordered same sized products from the same company before. They were always only delivered to the office. The staff, moments later, SHOVED into our open mailbox for us to collect.\n\nThe printer in the computer room was known for not working very often. The computers sometimes didn't work either. \n\nWe were once accused of not picking up after our dog, the official story being that someone tried calling after my husband to get him to clean up, but that my husband ignored them. Not only did nobody ever talk to him about his dog, but it wasn't even our dog. He was our roommate's dog, so they should have contacted her. Not him.\n\nThe outdoor amenities weren't what we expected. The hammocks were sometimes broken or missing. We found a few times that the grills were left on at night leaking propane. At one point, the fire pits wouldn't even turn on and I have no idea if that ever got fixed.\n\nDog trash cans were frequently overflowing and empty of any bags, sometimes left that way for weeks. \n\nThe dumpsters tended to overflow too, piles of trash and recycling so high you couldn't even get through. \n\nThe quarterly inspections were often unorganized and sometimes rescheduled to the day after they were supposed to have been done, which was incredibly inconvenient for us. \n\nDuring one of the inspections, they had trouble opening my bedroom door. I told them of they just lift the handle up instead of pushing it down, it opens just fine. A few days later, unbeknownst to us, maintenance came by because they were scheduled to fix it. After the inconvenience of the late inspection, the unwanted and spontaneous presence of maintenance was especially frustrating. \n\nAnother inspection happened on Halloween. I had to cancel my plans. My pets don't deal well with strangers coming into our home and I didn't like the idea of them entering unsupervised. So, with my plans canceled, we waited around for hours. I kept calling throughout the day, getting a different estimated time of when they would be getting to my building. No one seemed to be certain or even know what building they were currently working on. By the end of the day, NO ONE EVEN SHOWED UP. I called the manager and left an angry voicemail. The next day, I get a call back with the manager saying that they simply ran out of time, something I already knew because that was blatantly obvious. The worst part of it was that I didn't get an apology. The call was just a condescending excuse for them not doing their job correctly and having little consideration for their tenants.\n\nWhen we worked late, there was often no parking at all. We frequently had to park at the Fred Meyer parking lot. They advertise \"free parking\" but don't have enough parking spaces for everyone, so that's completely misleading. Even people who pay for RESERVED parking can't find spots at the end of the night!\n\nThere was a hole in the fence that led out to the Fred Meyer parking lot. It was continuously broken open again whenever it was repaired. The smart thing to do would be to put a gate there. (But it's Lark. They aren't exactly smart.) It's the least they can do for the people who aren't able to actually PARK in the Lark parking lot and have to walk around the fence in the middle of the night just to get home. But whatever. Keep wasting money replacing it, I guess. \n\nThey call themselves \"luxury apartments,\" but don't bother to even put backsplash in the kitchen or proper insulation in their walls. You can hear everything your neighbor does and the entire apartment is freezing during the winter.\n\nThis is by far the worst, most poorly managed place I've ever lived. Do not live here. Believe me, you'll regret it.",

I have waited a full year before writing this review so that my anger could subside and I could be concise, but this is still a lot. The prices are insane, and they are very aggressive in forcing you to sign and resign your lease. Our lease started in September and by October they were already egging us on to signing another year. So, we did, because we didn't want the prices to go up...what a mistake that was. \n\nWe all ended up moving out early because of the pandemic. But before that, we witnessed so many things that made none of us want to return. \n\nThe people who lived above us would constantly have parties late into the night, sometimes as late as 4 or 5am on a weekday. Blaring music and the sounds of moving tables, beer pong, and fireworks were just some of the noises. We would call security and nobody would pick up, or nothing would happen. Parking was also a nightmare, we bought reserved spots but even then if you came home after 5pm it was nearly impossible to find a spot (this was before the pandemic). The shuttle is an absolute joke- you would not only have to wait in line (most of the time in the rain because it's Washington) but there were hardly ever enough seats. It also would be shut down randomly so you'd have to find another form of transportation to get on campus, which normally is fine, except for the fact that the shuttle is advertised as a main selling point for the complex. The dumpsters were always overflowing and never seemed to be emptied. All of the amenities were a sham.\n\nThe other thing that was always incredibly frustrating was the front desk. I get it, college students need jobs; but they were never trained well and could never answer any questions you would have as a tenant- they were trained to get people to sign leases. That's it. \n\nAll in all, I urge you, do not get stuck in the trap that is this place. Their leases prey on innocent young students just trying to find a place to live.",

However life happens and Lark allows no flexibility when it comes to moving out. \n\nStaff will do their very best to avoid you if you need to move out. I got married in the middle of the school year and decided to transfer to an online school since my husband is in the military. I planned on moving in with him in SC. While I understand I signed a lease, no one in the office wanted to help start me with the move out process and there was zero communication. I sent emails, called the office and showed up yet it took weeks to hear back from them. I genuinely only think I was able to move out because of luck, and because my parents called and yelled at staff. There was also a point I was sent a refund, and they shorted me. I had to remind them how much I was supposed to get, THEN they sent me the proper amount back. \n\nDoesn't matter if you're 18-19, they will treat you like a child and avoid communication.\n\nSince moving out I have lived in 4 different apartment complexes around the US, and Lark will always be my worst experience.",

I lived here from August 2016 when the opened to February 2018.\n\nLet's start with a few positive before I get to the real tea. The apartments are nice. It looks quaint with IKEA furniture and with a decent amount of storage place. Each bedroom is huge and comes with a desk, full size extra long bed with mattress and storage under the bed, a bathroom with a tub and a walk in closet. The roommate match is hit or miss it honestly just seems like a just placing people randomly.\n\nNow let's start spilling:\n\nThere's trash (a Fred Meyer cart on the 3rd floor) and dog shit everywhere (including in the sand of the volleyball court), there's only 1/3 free parking spaces and 2/3 paid but there are always empty paid parking spots but supposedly they can't sell the exact number of parking passes for the exact number of spots. I would get home at 11 and they would call me  in the morning saying if I didn't move they would tow me and I kept asking for a parking pass but they said we sold the max. One night they decided to tow people parked in the paid spots at 3 am without notice.\n\nThey wouldn't give notice to enter the apartment, and would just come in. My unit had shitty insulation and we could feel the cold air coming through the outlets and windows so our heating bill in the winter would be like $100-130 a person in a 3 bedroom. We had a roommate who stole prescription medication from my other roommate and I but they wouldn't help us and they wouldn't kick him out. People who didn't live here would be in and out at all hours through the gates because the access codes were posted online so you never know who would be in the GATED community. People would either be throwing parties or be ridiculously loud at all hours with no one doing anything about noise complaints. When I first moved there people were throwing fireworks into random apartments as a prank. My boyfriend's bike got stolen there (it was locked and everything) and management would not help us out at all. \n\nLet's not even get started with the 60 page airtight lease where it even says that you're not allowed to give negative feedback online while you live there. They are a greedy and selfish company. I was asked to vacate but here's the fucked up part, they made me still pay rent for the rest of my lease even though someone had moved into my room but since it wasn't a new lease and because no one would take my lease I had to pay 650 a month for 7 month ( which was the cheap because i locked in my price in January 2016)\nThey never really had any events like they promised (they promised every month but it was like once every 4 months). The printers a lot of the time were either out of paper or out of ink.\n\nTo everyone thinking about moving here, it seems nice online and on paper but it's run by the worse property management company ever being operated by the bitchest managers who would never be helpful. Honestly if you're gonna do something like this try Elevate Bellingham ( I never lived there but I had friends who did) which is clean, has even bigger spaces and a lot nice amenities for about the same price and owned by a different company.",

They would not waive the $200 fee to move units or the professional cleaning fee to remove the smell, despite ignoring my health needs. At least they were polite about it. In addition, the furniture they provide is cheap and the floors of my unit are warped. \n\nManagement is awful. Flooding in an electrical room damaged my friends' unit, and all they did was plug in fans... using the tenant's electricity, which the tenants had to pay for. A lot of the units have a mold problem in the vents, too. They enter units for inspection without notice beforehand.

Lark's management is entirely for profit, at the expense of your own well being, and I had several red flag issues while living there.\n\n1. Lark will bankrupt you if that what it takes to extract profit. The move out process is not friendly to the resident. During the winter 2020 peak of the COVID-19 pandemic I was unemployed and needed to move out. When I notified Lark of my financial hardship they did not respond with sympathy, they instead replied saying I owed the full balance of my lease, and they threatened that they would pursue debt collection if I couldn't pay. \n\nAdditionally, Lark is unwilling to take reasonable efforts to mitigate damages and re-lease your unit, which is a fragrant dismissal of state property law. When I explained to the leasing office management that I would be moving to Seattle for law school and if they didn't allow me to exit the lease I'd be paying double rent, the manager looked me in the eyes and said she was sorry that I would be forced into starvation but there's nothing she could due about the remaining balance on my lease, including moving the unit into someone else's name.\n\nFast forward to me being here in law school--I've paid off my debt to Lark and I am left $128 dollars to my name! Did I mention I'm in school and cannot work? Yeah, it's really nice that my credit score is still intact since I did not go into debt collection, but I am one utility bill away from total bankruptcy and starvation! I hope the Lark staff is having fun using my blood sweat and tears to redecorate the lobby every 6 weeks.\n\n2. Living at Lark is not safe for a young woman. I have had several near misses of sexual assault with Lark. There have been several occasions where I am in my individual room, with the door locked, showering or naked or in my underwear, and a maintenance employee has tried to gain entry. I remember once I had just gotten out of the shower, heard maintenance unlocking my room door, and had only seconds to grab a towel and throw my body against the door to stop the man from entering. I literally had to push against the door and scream as he was opening it so that he wouldn't see me naked. \nAnother time, in August 2020 an unidentified man entered my apartment and tried to gain entry to my roommate's room. This incident occurred during the turnaround time where Lark deep cleans units for new residents. Lark employs an off-site cleaning service, and they will be in your unit with the door open and unlocked for several hours at a time. A man who was not associated with the cleaning crew came into our house, walked past the workers, and tried to enter my roommates room. He hung around the unit, inside and outside, and waited for one of us to come out because I saw him watching my door when I went to the kitchen and when he saw me he just left. I was very alarmed and went to text my roommate, but as soon as I saw my phone I saw frantic messages from her asking if I was the one knocking and shaking her door handle. It took both my roommate and I expressing fear of our safety multiple times for Lark to do the bare minimum and notify us when maintenance would be arriving at our unit. I still deal with trauma from these occasions and the constant fear that I am not safe inside my own apartment, even if the door is locked.\n\n3. Lark's lackadaisical, contemptuous and profit motivated approach to property management is disgusting, and it will be a lifelong regret of mine that I allowed myself to fork over thousands of dollars to a company that doesn't care whether I live or die.",

The sales team is intrusive from the moment tenants arrive, with a full court press on gaining a second year contract that starts immediately after arrival. The management team is syrupy sweet but unresponsive and disorganized. Read the 14 page lease carefully to see all the tactics they use to undermine tenant rights and evade accountability. Although the facilities are nice, the quality and integrity of the management team makes this a low quality experience for many residents. I would strongly urge prospective tenants to look elsewhere.

I know when touring it seems great and adult like, but it's not all it seems. \n\n1. The shuttle seems like a great idea until you actually get there and realize it doesn't actually have the capacity to hold the amount of students that it needs to. Unless you plan on standing outside for 30 minutes waiting for the shuttle to finally pick you up, I would recommend walking.\n\n2. Parking is extra which is complete bullshit. For the amount they are charging parking should be free and come with an assigned  parking spot by your apartment. This place is just a ripoff and not worth what you're spending. \n\n3. Management sucks. They are the least helpful people in the world. People will be screaming and playing music until 3 in the morning and they won't do anything. People leave their DOG POOP everywhere and they won't do anything. The computers in the lab don't work and they don't do anything. The people working here are honestly useless.\n\n4.

This complex has to have the most atrocious parking setup. There are two types of parking--residential and reserved. If you are lucky enough to be able to get on the list for reserved parking then parking won't be a problem. But is you do not get granted reserved parking you will be stuck with residential parking. There are not enough parking spaces and during the afternoon the parking lot becomes a free-for-all with people seemingly ready to crash into another car just to get a spot. If you work late or have classes later in the day you will NOT be able to park within the community. Many people park outside the fence or at the Fred Meyers located next to the Lark. If you drive a car are not sure you will be able to get a reserved parking space like many of the residents here, I suggest turning around and driving to another complex. \n\nThe staff are not helpful. They are ill equipped to solve any problem that is presented with them and quite a number a very rude if you are insistent on having a problem solved. \n\nScion Group itself is not helpful as well. I reached out to them with my complaints while taking the post move-in survey. They said they would be in contact but weeks have passed an I have yet to hear from them. There are clear problems from upper level management and this incompetency can be seen within the planning of the Lark community. \n\nOn a less serious note, I hope everyone looking into living here is ready to invest in physical therapy as the furniture is extremely uncomfortable. \n\nI will suggest to anyone reading this review to not live here. Find somewhere else with more competent staff and a more competent parent company preferably. It truest has been a regret living here and I'm looking forward to the remaining 11 months of torture ahead.",

It took almost 3 weeks to get rid of the fleas, during which time I got eaten alive and didn't get any reimbursement on my rent or anything. They did not tell me the people already in the unit had pets, and then when I asked to switch rooms they told me I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO SWITCH! Even though it was their mistake! And don't even get me started on the parking- there is never enough spaces if you go anywhere past 5 PM you won't get a space. I even paid for \"premium parking\" and I wouldn't get a space if I worked late that night. They were completely unhelpful during covid, all they did was extend the late period for rent payments by 10 days.

I have lived here the entire year with my car and recently found out my car was towed. How I found out is where the issue lies; my phone number is on call, my license plate and car description is connected with my car (as well as a sticker showing that I am a resident here), but I had to CALL the towing company myself after however many days it's been impounded and find out that I'm being charged $500 to retrieve my car that I have parked in my own apartment complex. Not ONCE was I notified by any of management that my car was being towed nor do I know WHY my car was towed. I have been unable to reach any of management for the urgency of this issue to find recourse for this or to even find out why I wasn't even simply contacted. Lark Bellingham takes a shoot first, ask questions later kind of aggressive approach with all issues that don't concern them, yet when you as a tenant have an issue, I guarantee most of the time you won't actually get more than a \"We're sorry!\" This has occurred in multiple situations. My roommates car was broken into earlier this year while parked on the complex and had an expensive subwoofer in (his car was lock, the window was literally smashed.) Something like this would normally be easily solved by having security on site, right? Well, Lark claims they do, but they have gone through at least 6 security officers in the span of this year and none of them have offered any actual protection to a complex as big as this. When he contacted management, all they did was point to the lease and say they're not responsible. Lark will take to their lease agreement and offer no recourse or assistance in any time of need; my neighbors were broken into and it took them weeks to send out an email which just stated \"Just keep your doors locked!\" I would not recommend Lark to anyone.",

I woke up one morning to find that my car been improperly towed, no notification from lark at all but they okayed the tow. I was told I didn't have a sticker but I had it placed where I was told to put it and their excuse was that \"it was dark and we didn't see it\" have you ever heard of a flashlight?! Lark makes residents pay and extra $30 for a reserved spot yet they can't seem to enforce parking AT ALL! They will lie to you and say their doing their best but it's all a lie. I was told that after hours there is nothing they can do! Residents are the one that need to call the towing company and report improperly parked cars! So my question is why are we having to pay an extra $30 each month if you can't even enforce the parking rules 24/7?! Lark also states that this is a gated community which in some cases it is but in reality they leave the gate open from 7am to 7pm for anyone and everyone to come in and if it's after 7 people that don't live there park outside the gate and wait for someone else to scan their card and sneak in. The management is corrupt saying that they care for their residents yet they suck them dry of their money. Because of larks mistakes I missed work as well as my dad because he had to get my car that they improperly towed having to drive all the way from downtown Seattle to Bellingham and all they offered was to take $30 off my next rent... is that a joke? That was slap in the face to me and clearly showed that all this place cares about is talking as much money as they can from students. It's so sad. Please do not sign a lease here, lark does not deserve the time of day or your money find a place that actually cares for its residents and not just suck them dry. Lark was also formerly known as NXNW and many residents believe the name changed happened because a naked man was masterbating outside in the apartment complex and the police had to shoot him with salt bullets, lark makes it seem like they are a perfect student houseing center but in reality it's party central drugs party's and alcohol 24/7 with no ways to file a complaint.

Don't mistake my one star for actually having any appreciation for this place; everything about this place is terrible and while half the stuff they advertise is complete lies, the other half is majorly exaggerated. \n\n- free parking? Nope! Their website implies that parking is free for everyone and that spots are always available, 90% of the time all parking is entirely full except for spots you pay $40 A MONTH FOR. Not only is it $40 extra to have access to an amenity they promised was free, but I have been on the waiting list for a reserved pass for almost 3 months. So, yeah, I'd even pay for parking if i could. Also, don't try temporarily using a reserved spot just until a resident spot opens; your car will get towed at 1 am 30 minutes after parking there! \n- private shuttle bus to WWU? Yeah, if you can manage to get a spot! Students are stuffed on the bus like sardines, some sitting on the floor just to pray they can make it to class on time. For a complex with hundreds of students, you think the shuttle would be able to fit more than maybe 25 people. Also, the shuttle is frequently shut down with no more than 12 hours notice for \"maintenance\"; once it was gone for three days while they gave it an ugly new decal. \n- $200 pet fee per year? Yeah, but there are rules they don't advertise: you can't have more than 2 pets, it's $200 per pet, and they'll make it as hard as possible to get any information. I was trying to emergency foster a small litter of kittens and the office was rude and condescending to me, as well as completely unwilling to help. \n\nThe walls to other apartments are thin.

When I filed a complaint about parking, the response i got was rude and suggested that I uber to work so I don't have to worry about their incompetent amount of parking (ubering to my job would cost around $30-$40 every night, which is almost as much as I make in one shift). When I filed a maintenance request about my dishwasher that wasn't cleaning dishes, I was told that I was \"putting the dishes in wrong\" and that bowls and pots weren't supposed to go on the bottom rack of the dishwasher even though that's exactly how a dishwasher works. Maintenance was either clueless or too lazy to fix it. Maintenance will enter your apartment with no regard for you or your privacy completely unannounced. Amenities will be taken away with 0 notification to the students; one of the biggest things that drew me to this place was the tanning beds they advertised. I suffer from seasonal depression and I was thrilled when I learned they offered tanning beds, only to be replaced with a \"meditation room\" with no notification to the residents. Security once yelled at us for playing music with our windows open at 9:30 pm on a Friday. Rooms are much smaller than they show them off to be. Wifi that's provided is slow and unreliable. All communication with the complex is condescending and rude. Drywall is cracked and waterlogged because of faulty appliances. Lights frequently flicker for no reason. \n\nOn top of all of this, our rent is $1700 a month. Lark Bellingham is taking advantage of and scamming students. I loved this place at first but everything advertised is gold plated. Take your money somewhere else.",

I get the reserve sticker but it means nothing people can park wherever they want. If you want you car to be in the lot just make sure you dont go anywhere past 7 especially on the weekends.",

      "review": "The apartments are fairly nice.  Be aware that this company is very aggressive about collecting any move out fees and will send you threatening letter indicating that they will report you to National Credit Services if you do not pay this fee within 2 weeks.   Take this threat seriously and pay your fees or they will attempt to ruin you credit.  We paid the fees within a month of move out and they did report us to a credit agency the month after payment. It has been a hassle getting our credit fixed.  We were able to prove payment prior to the company sending us to collections and I think this is straight now.  Probably best to avoid this company from the start.",

My son paid the penalty fee for an extra 24 hours to vacate his apartment, but staff and vendors cleared it within the 24 hours and without his permission. There was also no system in place: some items were bagged/tagged for him, although many items were tagged incorrectly; some items had been thrown away; and some items were on staff member's desks - it looked like they were keeping things for themselves! Staff were not helpful and simply called it a 'miscommunication within their team'. They did waive the penalty fee. However, there are many important documents and personal items that are now permanently lost. Just be warned!",

          "text": "Debbie, thank you for your feedback and review of our community. Our accounts manager has already spoken with you about this matter. When we go into the apartment upon move out, we do identify items of value and importance, and things that are irreplaceable. This would include documents, electronics, clothes, etc. When it comes to trashing out any other items, this would be any trash that was left such as toiletries, dishes, pans, household items, etc. A holdover fee was assessed due to the apartment still being occupied past his agreement end date. Our staff did reach out to Joseph on move out to explain that there was a fee being assessed, and he confirmed he would be getting his items that night. It is simply a holdover fee for not turning in keys on time, we still take possession of the apartment at that time. As he did not come to remove his belongings that night, at that point, we do go in and begin clearing the apartment. We did bag and tag his items, and then set it aside in our office for him to come pick them up. If you have any further questions about this, please reach out to our office at 360-778-1500 or office@larkbellingham.com"

  "summary": "# Lark Bellingham: A Mixed Bag of Student Housing Experiences\n\n## Good\nLark Bellingham, a university housing facility, seems to have a few redeemable qualities according to some user reviews. Positive aspects include the provision of essential amenities like a shuttle service to campus and a coffee bar, which are appreciated by the residents. Commendation has also been given to the spacious rooms, with each bedroom inclusive of a bathroom and walk-in closet, indicating a degree of comfort and privacy. The complex\u2019s location close to stores adds a layer of convenience for the residents, and the availability of furnished rooms reduces the need for students to outlay extra money for furniture.\n\n## Great\nSome residents have had positive experiences at Lark Bellingham, highlighting the helpful and courteous front desk staff as a highlight. Community events are mentioned as a means to forge connections among the residents, fostering a sense of community. The efforts of the staff, particularly during move-out processes, are evident, with some users feeling their concerns were adequately addressed. Moreover, the security provided by gated access appears to offer peace of mind to some tenants, and a few residents have expressed an eagerness to renew their leases, suggesting that their overall living experience was satisfying.\n\n## Bad\nOn the more negative side, common themes of dissatisfaction permeate several user reviews. Parking has been a source of frustration for many, with inadequate spaces and additional costs for reserved spots causing significant inconvenience. The shuttle service, while a valuable amenity, is criticized for its insufficiency in terms of seats and reliability. Residents have reported issues with maintenance, citing unresponsive actions to reported problems. Additionally, some users report aggressive sales tactics that pressure tenants into signing leases early, and find fault in the complex\u2019s response to noise complaints and lack of enforcement of community rules.\n\n## Ugly\nA more disturbing picture emerges from the ugliest aspects depicted in user reviews. Claims of predatory and unethical business practices have been alleged, with users stating that they felt victimized by the complex\u2019s management strategies. In some instances, tenants experienced poor living conditions, including hygiene issues and safety concerns. Issues with maintenance entering apartments without proper notice create a lack of privacy and sense of security among residents. Furthermore, there have been reports of unexpected fees and charges, lack of transparency during the leasing process, and perceived indifference to students' financial and personal hardships. The culmination of these issues suggests a fundamental disconnect between the management and the welfare of the tenants.\n\nIn synthesizing these sentiments, it's clear that while Lark Bellingham offers various amenities and conveniences that some tenants appreciate, there\u2019s a prevalence of critical issues that overshadow the overall experience. The management\u2019s approach to addressing tenants' concerns and its commitment to maintaining a healthy living environment are essential factors that require improvement.\n\nThis article intends to serve as a helpful insight into real user reviews for those considering Lark Bellingham as a housing option. Remember, reviews are generated by ChatGPT and aim to present a well-rounded perspective on the property management company. As a prospective tenant, it's always important to conduct thorough research and take into account both the positive and negative aspects presented here."
