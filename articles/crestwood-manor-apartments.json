        "review": "When I was a tenant at Crestwood Manor, it was an absolute nightmare. The property manager was extremely nosy and came to my door unannounced several times. She lost my rent checks THREE TIMES, would not fix ANYTHING in the apartment without being asked for weeks. My oven completely stopped working and she didn't get someone in to fix it for three weeks. I was completely without an oven for THREE WEEKS. Property manager lives in a house in the front of the place and there's always questionable looking people standing around and old beat up vehicles. It seemed like there might have been a lot of drug activity because some places had a LOT of traffic, and most of the tenants were pretty noisy. Doors slamming, yelling, music, knocking clear up until midnight sometimes. Glad I got out of there",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>    <p>This article is generated by ChatGPT and is intended to be a tool to help readers get an overview of Crestwood Manor Apartments based on user reviews. Please note that this summary is made from a single user review and should be used as a reference point rather than a definitive evaluation of the property management company. The article assimilates various aspects of the user review without disclosing any identifiable information about the author of the review.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Good</h2>    <p>In terms of the good aspects of Crestwood Manor Apartments, details are unfortunately sparse. From the user review, there was no specific mention of positive experiences or attributes that stand out. It appears, based on the single user review available, that the reviewer's expectations were not met during their tenancy, which leaves little room for highlighting good qualities in this context.</p>    <p>While the focus from the reviewer's perspective is more on the negative aspects, it is important to remember that this is a solitary viewpoint. Without further reviews for balance, identifying the good qualities solely from user reviews is challenging for this article.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Great</h2>    <p>Regarding the great elements of the property management at Crestwood Manor Apartments, the user review does not provide any comments that reflect exceptional service or amenities. It is essential to acknowledge that the absence of positive commentary in the review does not necessarily imply there are no commendable attributes; however, the limitations of a single-user review restrict the ability to define what might be considered 'great'.</p>    <p>This article's intent is to deliver a well-balanced overview, but without additional favorable experiences reported by other tenants, it remains difficult to depict a complete picture of the property management's virtues in this scenario.</p>  </section>  <section>    <h2>Bad</h2>    <p>The bad aspects of Crestwood Manor Apartments, as described by the user review, involve significant negligence on the part of the property management. The reviewer faced repeated inconveniences such as the property manager losing their rent checks on multiple occasions. Poor maintenance was also a significant issue, with requests going unaddressed for extended periods, exemplified by an inoperative oven that remained unfixed for three weeks.</p>    <p>Furthermore, the reviewer's experience was marred by the property manager's invasive behavior, including unannounced visits that suggest a lack of respect for tenants' privacy. Such experiences negatively impacted the user's perception of the management and contributed to an uncomfortable living environment.</p>  </Section>  <section>    <h2>Ugly</h2>    <p>The ugly aspects of living at Crestwood Manor Apartments are concerning, based on the user review. The presence of \"questionable looking people\" frequenting the property and a noticeable volume of traffic to certain units fueled suspicions of drug activity. The reviewer also recounted an atmosphere of disorder, with noisy neighbors, doors slamming, yelling, and loud music until midnight, which detracted from a peaceful domicile.</p>    <p>Additionally, there was a lack of a response from the property manager to the reviewer's complaint, exemplifying poor communication and customer service. It is worth noting that since the property management has not replied to the user review, there is no available counter-narrative or indication of efforts made to address these serious concerns.</p>  </section></article>"
