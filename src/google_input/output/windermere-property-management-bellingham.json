        "review": "Im a rental landlord who has utilized WPM for the rental of my condominium for over a decade. Although I have been pleased with my assigned agents during this period, I recently was re-assigned to Emma Lawrence. Her support of my needs as a landlord has been exceptional.\n\nMy rental condo was nearly destroyed by a broken sprinkler line in January 2024. In the three months since then, Emma remained my rental agent through a series of challenges, which included a complete rebuild of the condo. As you can imagine, this re-build process posed many challenges to the landlord (me) and the renters. (Its a long story, but lets just say it was very complicated.)  Emma Lawrence was the key to this unusual situation. As the landlord, Im very pleased with her assistance, and Im sure the renters are also grateful to her for her handling of this unusual rental property.",

        "review": "Ive had many problems with Windermere, first being they tried denying my ESA letters but after I argued with them, they then took the letters. My first months rent was denied twice due to insufficient funds when I triple checked that I had it then they made us pay by cashiers check or bill payment check through our bank, when I came to our last month paying rent, we got charged a late fee saying our rent was late when I have tracking information on my checks mailed and saw that they cashed it during our grace period and they proceeded to tell me that my bank probably takes the the money out before it reaches them. I had them dispute the charge since they took my payments on the same day every month and never got a late fee. We had them tell us 3 times about our dog poop and they claimed to have video footage but wouldnt provide the proof and wouldnt come look at the property themselves to see that there was no dog poop. Now after moving out, we deep cleaned the place before we handed in our keys. After 21 days they came back with invoices and charges for damages that werent necessary like they charged us for a carpet clean but also charged us for new carpet? Makes so sense. And also charged us for normal wear and tear like repainting of the windowsills and handrails. I highly recommend staying away from WPM if youre a young single adult, they like to take advantage of us.",

They pit tenants against each other during disputes and rely on the fact that people are afraid to lose their housing. They do not follow up on complaints and had come back to me, a few times, accusing me of the offense I had complained about. The manager also makes accusations without researching the issues and in turn blames the wrong person.\nThis review wasn't written with emotion.

Judging by customer service, responsiveness, ability to facilitate adequate service, and monitoring the communication this company is a 1 star. Our HOA Board has run our HOA into financial and physical ruin. We requested an Audit of our Financials over a year ago and still have not had that executed. This is just one example of a few in which service has lacked efficiency. Washington state should be putting heavy regulation on this corrupt industry ASAP.",

        "review": "Our experience renting from Windermere was terrible, to say the least.\n\n- Either communication between employees is completely nonexistent, or they actively ignore maintenance requests despite multiple phone calls checking in. They do not return phone calls or emails. We had a light out for two months in our apartment before they came by to replace it (the actual fixture was broken).\n- We smelled sewage within a few days of moving into our brand new building (The Vantage at 418 W Bakerview). The person who fielded my weekend call told me that was not enough of a reason to send emergency maintenance. They sent someone a few days later who determined there was no issue. Only after water started pouring into the unit below did they send someone else to fix what turned out to be a massive leak behind the wall under our kitchen sink.\n- The person who fixed that leak then sealed up the STILL wet area behind the cabinets until it started to smell. I can't tell you how many times I had to call the office to get them to respond to that maintenance request. My multiple requests for professional mold inspection were ignored. They looked under the sink, tested for moisture, and decided that was good enough.\n- The wall heaters are installed so close to the doors in the apartment that they were melting. I put in a maintenance request expressing concern for fire hazard and even followed up with a phone call. Never heard back.\n\nIf you value your safety and health in your living space, try to rent from literally anybody else. And definitely don't choose a unit at The Vantage.",

They indeed make you apply non refundable $45 fee to VIEW the unit before they do anything with your application, and I assume dont do a holding fee while looking over your application. I tried to ask about this and got a very confused yeah..we do the holding fee after you get accepted what? Everywhere else Ive looked, you can apply, then put down a holding fee to secure the unit while they process your application. The snickering in the background is when I decided this company isnt for me. Even if you as an employee think something is funny, you have to understand youre dealing w people who dont know how your system works from the outside. They are all different. This was so unprofessional and just added to my pile of stress in relation to renting.",

I lived under them for three years and this is not an exaggeration, the agency does not care about your health or well being, only your money. Maintenence requests go unanswered for months and months unless you call every week until they fix it. If your appliance breaks good luck getting a replacement sooner that two months. MULTIPLE times did I have to go to the laundromat for long periods of time or hand wash dishes for weeks on end.\n\nWe are getting charges over our damage deposit for things we told them to fix months and years before moving out. I am getting charged out of my deposit for a light bulb that was burnt out when I moved in. If you live in an old, rotten, outdated apartment it doesn't matter, they will still raise your rent $200 at a time. Trying to raise a family? Forget it because they failed to do anything about neighbors smoking and it coming into our apartment. Look at your new rental closely because they also paint over water damage.  Worst property management I have ever dealt with and everyone in thier office has an attitude anytime you call with a question. I guess I would be mad to if I was only making $17 an hour.",

Not only am I placed on hold for 45 plus minutes anytime I show up at the office with concerns, but then I am also moved down the call waitlist even though I was supposedly next caller on the line. They do the absolute most to not get back to you. One time I was waiting for help outside the office, a man who had his move in appointment at 4 had been waiting outside for his key for an hour. By then, Windermere was an hour late to HIS move in appointment. Very disrespectful and unprofessional. I also have some mental health issues that would gladly be aided by an ESA cat, but I was told I would have to pay a $2500 deposit just for the cat. Never have I seen a cat deposit for over $400.

        "review": "Update: since posting this review I want to add that the staff at Windermere was extremely friendly and helpful in the process of trying to find another rental property. I am not going to remove the previous review as I think it is important for people to know that they should stay on top of their application throughout the whole process. I do however want to give them credit for working with myself and my roommate and doing everything they could to keep us updated and help us find a place to live so last minute, especially Tanya, Ashley, and Frank. Although I am still frustrated about my initial experience, I definitely am very appreciative of the effort that has been put forth since.\n\nIm usually not one to post bad reviews and try to give companies and people the benefit of the doubt but I am so upset after my experience with Windermere that I feel like I have to speak up. I am giving them 2 stars because the staff has been very pleasant and I dont think that my experience was the fault of any one person but rather a flaw somewhere in the system. My roommate and I submitted an application for one of their properties and were told when we called to ask about the property that no other applications had been submitted. They also shared that they approve or deny applications in the order that they are received. We then called back a combined total of at least 8 different times between myself and my roommate to check the status of the application and to try and get a showing scheduled to see the property. We were told it would only take a few days to process the application. After a week, I was finally able to see the property and was told by the manager that she would make sure that our application was processed as soon as she returned to the office. All of this was fine until we received a text message over a week after submitting our application that another application had been approved today and that our application had been denied. This was despite the fact that we were told our application was the first to be submitted and that we should be getting the decision days prior. I dont understand how we would be denied in favor of someone else if our application was the only one submitted at the time that we paid our fees and they claim to be first come first serve but somewhere along the way our application was not prioritized in the order we were told it would be. I am extremely frustrated and the only reason that I am considering looking into renting a different apartment with them would be to try and make up for the $65 in application fees that I have already lost and given that the application remains open for 90 days.",

Tonya found us a gorgeous place in a market that is overpriced and out of control. Great experience since day one, very fast approval process. We moved in the house in less than 24 hours from seeing it. Great experience with Tonya and all the staff there too. We needed maintenance once and they were prompt to send somebody next day.\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, one really got stuck in my head so I'll share my thoughts about it. I think it is unfair to give a management company a one star review because you have pets but the owner wouldn't allow it. Find a place that allows pets and move in, or buy your own and do whatever you want with it.\n\nWe recently moved out and in less than 2 weeks we received our deposit back, and a follow up call to make sure that everything went great with the move.\n\nLong story short, our experience was great. Tonya is awesome, the staff is awesome.\n\nThank you again for a great experience!",

        "review": "Rented a three bedroom on Ashley Street for two years. The place itself was okay, though prone to mold and the windows did not close properly (they came with dowel rods to put in the tracks since they wouldnt lock). We filed maintenance requests on several occasions and they were almost always ignored (including that a pipe was leaking through the wall near an outlet when we turned on the outdoor spigot, and that the driveway was so covered in snow that it caused several accidents and was a safety hazard). These things were never addressed. We left the apartment in good condition, other than some damage done by a roommate that we gave the property manager a heads up about and took full responsibility for. We expected some money to be deducted from our security deposit for that damage, but when the charges came in the mail, Windermere took ALL of our deposit AND WAS ASKING FOR MORE. They deducted for things like about 8 hours of cleaning and full paint. They also charged for picking up trash that was outside of our bedroom window under our upstairs neighbors stairs, which was there when we moved in. They eventually dropped that charge after I wrote to dispute most of the charges, but we still ended up having to pay about $140 on top of losing our whole security deposit. We had moved out of state and it was not worth going to court over, which Im sure Windermere counts on. I should note that most of these issues happened under the watch of the previous property manager, and Ashley, the new property manager seemed very friendly in our correspondence about the security deposit, though Im sure she was limited on the help she could provide since she stepped in just at the end of our lease. I do not recommend renting from this company, and if you do, be sure to document everything.",

The unit was older and  I had some concerns about her living there but it was where the girls wanted to live.  In the end I found our property managers, both Bethany and the new prop manager Tonya, to be very helpful and attentive to all of our concerns.  All repairs were done in a timely fashion and all of the issues were addressed to our satisfaction.  And when our daughter decided to live there on her own for a while,  they worked with us then! We were treated fairly and I believe that if you follow policy, read through expectations and do what is required on your end that they will do the same.  When we moved out,  we left the unit clean and in good shape and we received our deposit refund pretty quickly. We paid to clean the carpets and yet were charged for that service again - but I didnt understand that was their policy. I wouldnt let the negative comments deter you from using this agency in my opinion, they were fair and reasonable and responsive!",

        "review": "I had such a bad experience with Windermere. My roommate and I found an affordable but old apartment near Western Washington University that needed a lot of repairs like; fixing the balcony doors, the window sill in one of the bedrooms wasnt fully sealed to the wall and cold air would blow through the gap when it was windy, also not all the electrical outlets worked and some went out, etc. I texted and called Tonya on multiple occasions for various issues especially the balcony doors which she had promised to fix after we moved in. Tonya specifically told us that the doors had already been ordered. I waited to hear back from Windermere about proceeding with replacing the doors and after not hearing a response I texted Tonya again and didnt hear back from her until months later. Anytime my roommate or I had an issue, Tonya from Windermere was so slow to respond which was very unprofessional. I had a lot of patience and kept putting all issues aside but Windermere was to slow to fix the problems. Also the balcony doors were never replaced and I have texts to prove they were going to be replaced from Tonya. I barely stayed a year at this place before moving on. Plus there was one night when a car caught fire in front of the apartment building and it didnt feel safe anymore. Overall the service that Windermere provided wasnt professional and they were very slow to respond and I will avoid going through any more apartments processes with them ever again.",

When I moved back here it was so hard to find a place especially in our price range. When we found our home she helped me so much with the process of getting set up it made it so much easier on me and my family. She treated me not just well, but like family. She was always professional and she always had my back when we had a disagreement with the neighbors. She fought for me when I needed something, she was always super fast getting back to me, if I ever needed any help with anything regarding the home I am renting. Even in her spare time she would respond to me if I ever had a question or needed something. I would recommend Tonya Wiley to anybody looking for a rental in the Bellingham area she is a breath of fresh air and a ball of sunshine in the community. She always does her best to help others and she doesnt expect anything in return. I feel so lucky that I had her as my property manager for the year that I did. I know that in the future if I ever need to find Another rental or home that Tonya is who I would be contacting for any of those needs. She is not only an amazing businesswoman but she is my friend and I just wanted to share what an amazing experience I had as her client. She really helped me when I needed it the most and I will never forget that. Windermere property management is very lucky to have her. Also, the front staff at Windermere was always so kind and sweet every interaction I had with them. I never had any complaints I stand behind Windermere as a company and I stand behind Tonya Wiley as a property manager. Thank you to Windermere for all of your help and support.\nSincerely,\nHannah Johnson",

We had to pay a double deposit to move in to our place and half of that was taken away after moving out. The paint job was spotty when we moved in and was in same condition upon moving out but they charged us to repaint. The entire experience was more work than it was worth. I recommend avoiding working with this company unless absolutely desperate. I 100% believe they overcharged for every single thing including utilities that \"had\" to be billed through them and couldn't come directly to me. There responses to questions or issues were slow and incomplete or just non existent. The property listing was inaccurate stating \"pets possible\" which was one of the reasons we chose the property and after moving in were told no pets when all the neighbors had pets. I will definitely never work with any windermere branch or affiliation again because of this experience. The property manager was never of any help and out of office everytime we tried to contact. Don't let the front desk kindness fool you into believing that the company is the same way, they are not.\n\nListen to the other 1 star reviews I believe they are just as accurate as mine.",

We have had so many issues with Windermere, most of them involving the property manager not contacting us or responding to emails and phone calls. The icing on the cake was when we were never notified that Windermere was taking over (admittedly not Windermere's fault) however, then four months later I was doing my personal budget and we discovered that our condo dues had stopped automatically coming out. For 4 months we were never notified that we were not paying our condo dues! That is very alarming as a property owner when those dues are important to maintaining a reserve fund. Then, when I identified the problem, Windermere did not apologize at all for the issue and I had difficulty getting any one to call/email me back to try to rectify this issue. I could go on and on and I've only had Windermere managing my condo association for less than 6 months! The most recent issue is that we were served a random letter about needing a new water heater because it was over 10 years old. Now I can't get a call back about that! If you are paying money to have your property managed, find a different company. I am sorry to say you will be disappointed with Windermere. We are going to sell our condo now instead of dealing with the terrible customer service and problems with this property management company.",

And absolutely DO NOT LEASE AN APARTMENT AT 2300 DOUGLAS. These apartments are outrageously expensive, and the quality of them is terrible at best. There is absolutely no sunlight filtering in through the apartment, you have to pay an absurd amount to use a washer and dryer that are literally the size of a microwave, and because they dont replace the carpet or repaint it always smells dirty and musky. The first time we saw Bethany, the landlord, was on our move out day. She has since tried to take almost all of the security deposit for things missing, which are absolutely present and in the unit (albeit, they are not great quality, but it is what they left for us at the start of the lease. Replacement should thus come out of THEIR pocket, not ours). $250 to replace a door knob, Bethany? Please girl. We have called and emailed to ask questions and clarify, and have not received any response at all. If at all possible, let me reiterate: seek other options.

It took me asking people on Reddit for advice for them to install a handicap spot. Now that that has been done, they ignored my requests for a second spot when I realized my neighbor has a disability as well. Sandi Jones is my PM and she offered me $200 to move out this summer when we had MOLD in our bathroom because she claimed they couldnt find a maintainence guy to fix the floor that was torn up by another! Incompetent and a liar!\n\nTo top this off, I was told to contact the police of people park illegally in the handicap spot.

If I fall, Im suing Windermere and I told them I would.\n\nIt isnt just that, but several stairs are crumbling. My upstairs neighbor fell through the bottom ones years ago, and Windemere and the new owner know they need to be replaced and nothing has been done. The health department and city of Ferndale cant do anything either. Someone is going to get seriously hurt or worse, and all Windermere does is ignore emails. ESPECIALLY Sandi!

We made the mistake of being too confident in how nice we left the place that when we moved out that we didn't take any photos and got charged outrageously for things that didn't make sense or exist.\n\nWhen we first moved in, there was holes in window screens, a glue stain on the wall or something from putting carpet down (we assume that's what it is, we've tried washing it but it didn't come out with cleaner) when we first moved in. These things we pointed out when we noticed, along with a broken handle on the microwave but was shrugged off because it personally didn't bother us. There was also things already existing on the property. The garage was full of home maintenance materials, such as wood, paint, and other things. There was a shed full of miscellaneous things that looked to be there for years that we were told belonged to the home owner so we didn't touch it.\nNow we're getting charged for these things, as well as the glue on the wall being blamed on our pet.\n\nWe made sure this place was spotless and we only lived in it a year with very little use. There was a scrape on the wall from our chair and that was it. But somehow we're getting charged OVER our deposit amount. Over things like lightbulbs and other ridiculous things! We unfortunately didn't take photos, they didn't even give us a walk around to ok things either.\n\nAfter we had moved out they told us some time into the next month for the first time that if we didn't hand over the keys they'd charge us another month's rent. We never had this before because locks are usually replaced by home owners making the keys useless (beware on that also if you plan on renting from them).\nWe were moved up into Canada at the time but luckily we had to do one last run into the states to cover bases so we were able to return the keys in time.\n\nWe have never had issues with any of the rental properties we've lived in. We always got full or 90% of our deposit back. We always have had shining reviews with our landlords. We pride ourselves as good tenants.\nIf you plan on renting from Windermere, be prepared to be swindled out of every penny they can manage to get out of you.

However, I received no call back, no follow up, no apology for my inconvenience and I still don't know what happened. I guess, assuming this is an indication of how they do business, I potentially avoided major problems in the future.  Just saying'.",

Heroin dealing wasn't being addressed neither were the pothead thrives next door. They stole another approximate $900 as far as deposit was concerned.

For instance, they broke a cheap 10 dollar towel bar and took 80 out of my deposit. I took them to small claims, called 911 dozens of times for the break ins, and asked for help with law advocates. No one will hold these predators accountable. They prey on disabled, poor, and section 8 tenants. Please don't rent from them. They've stolen 6000 from me when my yearly income is 8500.

          "text": "While we at Windermere Management empathize with your situation, we are unable to pay you the unfounded small claims action that you filed against us. The judge clearly informed you that there was no basis for your claims of theft from your apartment home and your storage unit or for the condition of the apartment home when you returned your keys. The home needed paint, hauling, cleaning, repairs of a wall heater and towel bar as well as carpet cleaning. You were provided photos in court as to the documented condition of the home. You were also carrying a past due balance on your account going into the reconciliation process. Since we do not manage the storage unit where other theft was reported, we cannot speak to that situation. We offered to re-key your unit when we were informed by you of the alleged theft, and you opted to have it done. According to you the theft continued. We have no control should you leave your doors or windows unsecured. We advised that you should call the police and provide them with dates, times and descriptions of the perpetrators. In court you said you called the police many times and they never responded. You did say also that you attempted to retrieve your lost items from a neighbor and were arrested. Our hope is that you are able to retrieve your personal effects and that you can move forward."

        "review": "My best friend's family and I rented from Windermere for the duration of a ten month lease that just ended, and I have never had such a positive experience with a property management company. Bethany in particular has been extremely kind and helpful! Where should I begin?\n\nWell, first, before we even signed the lease, there was an issue that arose from us applying to a property the owner of which didn't want rented to students. We all somehow overlooked this on its listing, and since I was just starting graduate school I declared that I was a student on my application. We were initially denied the property, but I felt that \"students\" wasn't intended to mean graduate students in their mid 20s, so I wrote them a letter explaining that I understood they need to respect the property owner's stipulations and asked if my appeal and the explanation of the circumstances could be forwarded to you owner. Bethany responded to my email and was was very nice and understanding. She explained the situation to the owner, and we ended up getting the house! Yay!\n\nWhile we lived there, they were really good about giving us notices of entry on time, and they didn't micromanage the property we rented at all--not even after they came in for an annual inspection, or when our lawn mower broke and our yard was a jungle for a few weeks while we Craiglisted around for a new one. No guff was given, it was really pleasant to rent from them. I've had many landlords that breathe down tenants' necks. I remember once, when I was a kid growing up in Montana, my family rented from someone who insisted that we shovel the walkway WHILE it was snowing. In Montana! I don't remember if it was an individual or a property manager, but the moral of this story is that landlords can be absolutely crazy.\n\nI think we were even late on our rent once, and I don't believe they dinged us for it.\n\nBut moving out this past week has been where Windermere has really shown me how accommodating they can be if you're nice about things. June rolled around, and we got notice that the house wasn't going to be re-rented after our lease expired, so we had to find a new place--fast. We found a place that became available on or a few days after the first of July, so there was going to be a day or two (or three) period where we didn't have a house. We were fine with this, but the problem was that we have four tropical fishtanks that need to be plugged in all the time. It looked like we had two options: move the fish tanks to the middle of a very generous friend's living room or garage, only to move them once more after a few days (which would stress the fish out twice as much as a normal move would, and would SUCK SO BAD since these are large tanks and all have live plants), or see if Windermere will allow us to keep them on the property after we were supposed to be totally out. Bethany again understood our situation and we were able to just leave the tanks there for a week after they could have legally disposed of them. This took a LOT of stress off of our shoulders. I really appreciated all this flexibility and reasonableness, and if I find myself renting in Bellingham again, I'll be sure to check Windermere's listings first. Thanks for working with us like you have!",

However, the response did nothing to repair the problems, except to fix one of the doors so it locked.  I doubt that this place would pass an electrical inspection.  My son eventually was diagnosed with multiple illnesses related to the ongoing mold infestation.  To sum it up = do NOT do business with WIndermere Property Management.  They continue to have this place on the market and are misrepresenting it. I am saddened that a fine company like Windermere would do this.

We would like to take this opportunity to respond to your comment.\nWe imagine your unfavorable review is written in response to the Deposit Disposition letter you received recently.\nThe back side of the move out notice provides a comprehensive list of items that need your attention prior to move out. It is very important that the unit is left in good condition and ready for the next tenant to move in. Unfortunately this was not the case when you vacated your unit. The unit was left dirty and required 5 hours of cleaning. The kitchen was particularly dirty. The paint was new upon move in and according to HUD guidelines the life expectancy for paint is 5-7 years. When you moved out there was damage done to the paint beyond normal wear and tear. The walls throughout had black soot damage on them to which left outlines on the walls where items had been hanging. You were charged for  of the cost to paint the unit.\nWe work very hard to be fair to our tenants while still doing what is right by the property owner. If you have items you would like to discuss regarding your experience with Windermere Management, we would be happy to meet with you."
