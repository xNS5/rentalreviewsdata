        "review": "We recently moved into this complex. It is a modern, clean, attractive, fun place to live in Bellingham. The Sales staff are super friendly and instantly accommodating. (Special kudos to Megan) The recreation room offers Billiards, Table Shuffleboard, Air Hockey, Foosball with two large screen TV's for football Sunday, while you play.\nParking abounds, there's a kids' play area outside, BBQ zone and a Community Room for having a coffee and watching special events. By the way, did l mention their Workout Gym? Best l've seen in an apartment building. It's also month to month, which works for us. The two ladies that run the property are efficient, charming and professional!\nYou can't go wrong renting here!",

        "review": "Overall decent apartment complex with its flaws: lack of recycling other than corrugated cardboard, obsolete method of payment (checks or money order), and frequently backed up traffic on NW, making existing the parking lot somewhat annoying during rush hour. The lack of recycling is not acceptable in 2024, and the payment form, a little laughable.\n\nIt is a little pricier than your similarly featured condo in Bellingham, but that is just the normal cost of having a month to month lease with a much lower than average down-deposit. If you are a long-term tenant, then this building may not make sense to you.\n\nConstruction quality is sub-par, with many nicks, rattles, small issues everywhere. Not sure whether it will be decrepit in no-time, or updated along the way. Bright units, with convenient layouts and tall ceilings make up for that.\n\nMaintenance and staff are all friendly and honest, and have always responded quickly and adequately to our requests, with positive resolution.\n\nLocation is convenient, and parking plentiful.",

        "review": "- Management with no web technology: payments or maintenance service requests are made manually, over the phone, or via email. I experienced this a a major inconvenience when one of my checks to pay rent got stuck in their mail box and they immediately issued a vacant letter since this was the 5th of the month. No excuses when they found it. They, however, use cameras to verify if you deposited anything in the same mail box. They have cameras all over and, apparently, the receptionists pass a lot of time time to inspect us. Very cold war style.\n- Customer service. Their expert receptionists decide if maintenance issues deserve the visit of a technician, to the point they wanted to charge me for a second visit when I was not satisfied after the first one. This already breaches the lease contract, but these ladies seem to be over-powerful as their main office did not object.\n- Poor luxury concept. The quality of their vinyl floors and carpets, the quality of their appliances all the same brand, their noisy heaters, and the total lack of air conditioning is not consistent with the fact their fees are the highest in Bellingham.-\n- Facilities. They show potential tenants an empty hall to become a movie theater soon. However, I did not see that taking place during my nine months. Their gym is not special and rather boring: four elliptical, three treadmills, and two weight lifters. No pool, no young families with children, some elderly in combination with very young couples or single people. The environment was depressing in the overall.\n- Deposit return. I spent half a day cleaning my one-bedroom with a lot of care. To me, it was something personal after all my complaints and struggle. When I got my deposit back, they had taken $225 from $600 and claimed offensive things like their cleaning of urine and excrement. They are just the worst and it is not worth to take them to court for this amount.",

        "review": "Lived here for just over a year. Absolutely loved it here. Only moved because I got a new job and had to relocate. Great location, 5 min drive to I5 or to Fred Myer/Costco.  Rent can only be paid by checks or money order (c'mon, it is 2024....) and is a bit on the expensive side, but for me is well worth the premium for what is being offered. Brand new building with lots of amenities, unique ultra high ceiling for top floor units. Always clean and very quite (for unit facing north, away from I5). Staffs are always friendly and helpful. The short term month to month lease worked out for me too when I had to relocate.",

        "review": "I have rented to multiple apartments and property managements before, and so far, Grandview Management and Park Place has been my worst experience.\n\nTips to future potential renters of this apartment complex:\n1. Make sure you are fully aware of what their security deposit policy is DURING your tour. Get a recording or written explanation from the office staff if you can. They only told me about the policy when I was about to move in, so I didnt have a choice but to accept the lease agreement stipulations or be homeless.\n2. Take pictures or videos of the state of your unit PRIOR to moving out. They will exaggerate their MOVE OUT INSPECTION FINDINGS to suck as much money as they can from you.\n3. Just dont rent here LOL. Its not even just about the rent prices they demand. But with how the office staff/property management treat their renters. Very old-school and punitive. For a luxury and high-end apartment complex, the attitude and vibe here is ghetto. Especially at night when meth-heads roam around the property freely.",

        "review": "PARK PLACE APARTMENTS IS A SCAM!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM 0 STARS IF I COULD.\n\nI recently had the unfortunate experience of renting at Park Place Bellingham, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts to warn others. From the outset, the lack of transparency regarding the apartment's conditions and policies was alarming. Communication with the front office was often vague, leaving me feeling uncertain about various aspects of my lease.\n\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of my experience was the handling of my security deposit. I WANT FUTURE POTENTIAL RESIDENTS MADE AWARE THAT YOU NEED TO STAY AT LEAST 6 MONTHS TO GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK. THE STAFF WILL NOT TELL YOU THIS UNTIL YOUR MOVE-IN DAY. WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS AND SKETCHY PRACTICE.\n\nOverall, my experience at Park Place Bellingham has left me feeling scammed. I would advise potential renters to proceed with caution and consider other options where transparency and respect for tenants' rights are prioritized.",

        "review": "I agree with all of the positive comments regarding this property.  I gave them 4 stars because the only thing missing is a pool or a jacuzzi, then it would be close to utopian.\n\nFor those negative reviews, specifically about price, you can blame Bidenomics.  Also, a proper education would enable you to earn a much better income, therefore allowing you to live here without complaining about cost. Be better not bitter.  You can't expect a new build to charge even half the rent that they charge.  If you are complaining about a $5 move out lock changing fee then you probably couldn't afford to live here anyway.  Plenty of open air encampments in the area where you can pitch a tent and never pay any fees for moving.\n\nFinally, if your initials are Dk (missing the ic) you shouldn't call anyone a douche without actually meeting and getting to know them.  The builder of this property probably wanted to elevate the standards of living in Bellingham.  If you don't like high end brands, that you can't afford, there are other more economical choices for you.  Tents are on sale right now.\n\nP.S.  Don't respond to my review if I hit a nerve.  Be better not bitter.  Words to live by.",

        "review": "Park Place Apartments has been a WONDERFUL place to call home over the last 6 months. The amenities offered (the beautiful lounge, friendly management, a coffee bar in the lobby, a fitness center, covered parking, a small basketball court, a game room, electric vehicle charging, a playground for the kiddos, a large area for secure bicycle storage, and much more) are unbeatable. The location of this building is spectacular, as it is very close to essential businesses such as grocery stores, restaurants, a gas station, Bellingham International Airport, and even an urgent medical care office across the street.\n\nThe people who run the office are incredibly kind and understanding, and things run very smoothly here, thanks to them. The other tenants are super respectful of quiet hours, and the property is always kept clean.\n\nOverall, Park Place is a great place to live, and if you are looking for a place to live in Bellingham, I highly recommend taking a tour to check it out!",

        "review": "These apartments are clean and spacious, and the whole complex is tidy with nice amenities, like secure mail room, treats in the reception area, game room, community room, and gym. Theres a play area out back and a mini basketball court. I found the staff friendly. I appreciated that we could do a short-term rental.\nAs a bicycle commuter and rider, I did not find the bike parking in the garage secure and staff recommended I keep my bike(s) in the apartment (confirming that it wasnt secure).\n\nThere are a LOT of rules.\nOnly cats are allowed, but dogs live in the complex. If you want to live here with your dog, make sure its an emotional support animal. Thats how you do it. They wont offer that.\nBecause recycling can be untidy and to avoid the property being fined on account of tenants, the only recycling is cardboard. Trash must be double bagged and tied closed. Twice the plastic in the landfill will keep the trash chute neat and tidy.\nDo not even think of air drying your clothes on a rack on the balcony. Its unsightly and therefore forbidden.\nBeginning in mid-December, there are more rules. No plants on the balcony and no hanging baskets. Any balcony furniture must be pre-approved by management and conform to their aesthetic preferences or you cannot have it. If you put a bicycle on the balcony, they can come and take it without notice. No flags or other hanging items on the balcony, no smoking grills. Obviously, no junk. (If you didnt know it, your personal preferences for how to live are junk.) Its all about their aesthetic for the place and doesnt seem to matter that the tenants are renting the balconies.\n\nThere isnt a rule about bike parking nor are there any public racks, but you will still get a nastygram for temporarily locking your bike outdoors somewhere out of view, out of the way, out of the landscaping and not on anyones balcony. No one will kindly get in touch with you because its clear your lifestyle does not conform and is not welcome.\n\nDuring move out, its on you, the tenant, to pay $5 to change the door lock. Even though the rental agreement says you will not be charged for normal wear and tear, you can expect to be charged at least $50 for painting to address normal wear and tear, $90 to sanitize a spotless apartment, and $85 for them to professionally clean the carpets.\nIn keeping with the friendly relationship they have established with you, you will receive a certified letter with the departure accounting. The sentence with the payment due date will conclude with to avoid legal action and the next sentence will threaten to send you to the collection agency.\n\nOffensive business model. We had planned to stay longer but took our business elsewhere.",

        "review": "It's never the amenities but the management/the people running this place.\nThe quality of management is more important than the amenities offered by a place. During our tour of this property, my wife and I encountered a rude property manager who spoke to me in a dismissive manner when I called to inquire about becoming a tenant. Despite being initially interested in renting a 1-bedroom apartment here, I ultimately decided to take my business elsewhere.\n\nPros:\n\n- The building is new and has only 15-20 tenants.\n- Good amenities, including new appliances and decently sized 1-bedroom units (682 sq ft).\n- The Yoga and game room are nice.\n\nCons:\n\n- Cumbersome application process unless paying in cash at the leasing office; no website available for application.\n- No online rent payment option; rent must be paid by cheque dropped off at the office.\n- Extremely rude property manager.\n- Packages left out in the open with no visible cameras, putting them at risk of theft.",

        "review": "So, it was interesting that this place was mostly empty. It is clean and neat, almost sterile. Not cheap, but the talking points indicate that it is \"luxury living\".\nNo dogs, no dogs anywhere including in vehicles on this property. Although I dd notice a fair number of what appeared to be dogs and was reminded, somewhat dismissively, that they were support animals.\nWe rented a unit that faced the courtyard. What we did not know is that the lights, alot of lights, like a prison yard were lit at night. When I asked, it was explained to me, that those were on a timer. Appeared to me to be a variable switch.\nThe entire complex is quiet enough. We did not appreciate how being next to I5, and the complex being on top of the brow of the hill would funnel that noise. The frequent and intermittent music to discourage transients blaring from the car dealership was something that was a matter of self-discovery.\nEveryone adjusts, eventually.\nWalking score, very low. Biking score, you literally take your life in your hands.\nIf you have a vehicle and are totally vehicle-dependent, you too can pour into the traffic circles in the morning and back out in the evening.\nI feel badly for the staff. It seems they are forced into a role of being camera watching, hall monitor rules minders.\nThe lease is an absurd 40 pages. I have purchased homes with less paper (and yes, they print you copies to take along). I wondered out loud to peers and friends if some of it is even legal.\nThe only way you can hope to see your deposit back involves two methods, one stay at least 6 months, and two, do not live in your place while renting. With our work schedules, we were there 5 out of the 8 weeks of our lease. Our final bill was nearly half of the initial $600 deposit, which was forfeited.\nTwo older adults cannot cause less of a stir.\nOverall, we were the lucky ones. We were remodeling, we needed a short-term cheaper-per-day-rental and we were able to move out. We did pass the credit and criminal checks, we did pass the 2.5 times income to rent ratio.\nWould I recommend this property or this management group? No. No equivocation, no conditions to my answer.\nNo.",
