        "review": "If I could rate ia zero I would.  Lakeway managed a property here in Bellingham that my daughter rented.  It was her first rental as she was attending college here.\n\nSheri, the receptionist, assured me as a father that she was in good hands.  Reality was quite the opposite.  I have heard of slum lords before, but never actually met one until now.\n\nsheri specifically was abusive and childish, yelling at the tenan for requesting repairs, then retaliating against them with rent increases, etc.\n\nupon moving in to the house that Lakeway managed, my daughter realized that there were many things that were not up to code that would allow the house to be rentable.  Her room did not have a source of heat, the floors were rotted, the house was infested with termites, the list goes on and on.\n\nmy daughter went to the city and had the house inspected, and it was woefully short of legal.  The city gave them 30 days to rectify it and a list of repairs that would take hundreds of thousands of dollars to remedy.\n\nthe repair persons we're often showing up without notification, and would be stoned o make inappropirate comments to the college girls who lived there.\n\n\nLakeway sold the house rather than repair it, and at no point in time have the tenants been communicated with or let out of their lease.  The only good thing that has come from this is as a parent I got to see my daughter stand up for her rights as a tenant, and I am proud of her,\n\nI would never recommend Lakeway for any reason.",

We ended up finding a lawyer,  reporting the home to the city, and upon advice of the lawyer breaking contract and moving out . Now 3 years later lakeway has sent us to collections for things broken when we moved in but made note of on the initial inspection. we were promised multiple rent reductions because the place was trashed when we moved in but that never happened and by renters law the way they handled our whole situation we were due our deposits but that never happened either",

        "review": "Are you considering renting from Lakeway?\n\nYou may be like I was before I signed a lease with them. I thought, \"I'm a responsible adult. People who complain about them are probably irresponsible college kids who aren't getting their deposit back for good reasons. As long as I am clean, respectful, pay my rent on time, and don't do any damage, I will be fine.\"\n\nSpoiler alert - I was a dumb dingus.\n\nAfter I move out they send me a bill telling me I owe them $XXX.XX for a water bill. This doesn't make sense to me so I talk to the water company and they confirm that my balance was totally paid, then Lakeway overpaid by $XXX.XX bringing it to a negative balance. I tried to talk to Lakeway about it because I assumed it was a mistake. This is when their cheery tone turned sour.\n\n\"We don't do disputes in person,\" they said.\n\n\"You have to email us about it,\" they said.\n\nSo I emailed the dispute multiple times and never heard back. A year passes.\n\nI get a call from a collection agency demanding I pay this money. LAKEWAY IS SO SHADY THAT THEIR OWN LOCAL COLLECTION AGENCY GAVE UP THE CASE AFTER I EXPLAINED THE FACTS. But Lakeway is so intent on stealing my money that they just sent it off to some other collection agency in another city. Now I can either submit to this act of extortion, or take a hit to my credit.\n\nEveryone at Lakeway is complicit. They're all slobbering at the trough, waiting desperately for their master to splash more shit water in their face. They want it so bad. They say, \"Daddy, more shit water please!\" Then Mr. Lakeway scams another honest, hardworking person with a real job out of their paycheck and returns to his piggies at the trough.\n\nNow that you are aware of their horrible practices, please have some respect for yourself and never, ever, EVER rent from these disgustingly unethical, slobbering scam artist garbage humans.\n\n#FriendsDon'tLetFriendsRentFromLakeway\n\nP.S. I could write 2 more pages of legit complaints about my time renting from them - this was just the worst of it.",

Plan on them keeping most or all of your deposit for \"Cleaning fees\" even if you leave it cleaner then when you moved in right after it was \"Cleaned\". Their places are pretty horrendous but it's up to you if you want to live in it. I did because it was coming pretty close to our last option near campus but I won't be renting from Lakeway again and I urge everyone to avoid them at all costs. Our bathroom sink became clogged about 6 months in and nothing was working to unclog it, the handyman couldn't even do it because we needed new pipes and said we needed a plumber, even after 20 phone calls throughout the rest of our stay they refused to hire a plumber to fix it so our bathroom sink was nearly unusable.",

        "review": "Everyone in Bellingham knows-- Lakeway Realty is a bunch of bullshit. They take advantage of the housing market here and rent their shitty properties to young college kids who can't find a decent place. For example, when I moved into my Lakeway house a few months ago, two windows were straight up BROKEN and our oven had an exposed wire hanging inside it that blew the fuse on our whole kitchen when we tried to make a frozen pizza. \nHOWEVER! There are ways to make your experience with Lakeway easier if you are stuck with them:\n\n1. When something is broken, try and fix it yourself first. \n2. If you need a maintenance person's help, call Lakeway and ask for the maintenance person's phone number. DO NOT expect a maintenance report filed by Lakeway to help anytime soon (could be weeks or months until they give the report to the independent contractor they hire). This is mostly since the queen bitch, Cheri, keeps all the independent contractor numbers in her cell phone, and from what I've experienced no one else has the means to call them. \n3. Try to talk to someone other than Cheri. She is unreliable and obviously hates her job and all of you people.\n4. TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES before all your stuff is inside and EMAIL the pictures to Lakeway for reference. This will help when you move out and Lakeway tries to take your entire deposit and then some for repairs they probably won't even make (at least the deposit is only $250). \n5. Lastly, don't expect them to solve your problems. Don't expect much of anything at all. They are a horrible company, but you need to live in their houses so just try and bear with it.\n\nIn conclusion: Lakeway sucks, but they never come by so you both can live in peace if you just pretend like they don't exist. Go through the maintenance people personally and they will help get your stuff fixed faster that way.",

        "review": "STAY FAR AWAY FROM THEM ... TENANTS BEWARE!***\n \nMy name is Janine Manchel, and I am the mother of Hannah Manchel -- one of your tenants at 412 Lakeway Drive in Bellingham, WA.  We have faithfully been paying rent on time on our daughters room for just about 1 year now.  She moved in in September, 2016 and immediately discovered leaks and water intrusion in her room, the bathroom upstairs, the bathroom downstairs, the kitchen, among other areas in the home.  How you can justify just re-renting a house that is leaking beyond my understanding.   I'm confident that, according to the Landlord Tenant Act, you are required to offer a home that is habitable -- living in a home with water intrusion and the black mold it causes is far from being habitable.     I flew out to help her clean everything up, and advised all of them to keep after you to address this situation.  It's now June, 2017, and these students are STILL dealing with water intrusion, leaks, black mold and the health issues from being subjected to these conditions for over 9 months!   At one point, a handyman was sent to check it out, but never followed through on this issue.  As were the several other attempts to resolve this problem early on!    I'm attaching the information that was sent to me from the EPA as well ... as her landlord, certainly you are aware that you are required to offer your tenants a clean and healthy place to live and breath!  This home is far from the habitable place that one would expect.   Why you have to be reminded of this basic need constantly is disgusting!  \n \nI will address the water intrusion/leaks again below, but it has come to our attention that my daughter was walked in on in her private bedroom (usually padlocked when she isn't home) when Cheri was showing the place to future potential tenants the other day!  Months and months before their lease is even up!  As a parent in today's crazy world climate, surely you can understand how that would be completely and absolutely unacceptable!  I don't care what the circumstances are, or how many unreceived posts you posted, it is not acceptable to just walk into their private home and certainly into their private bedrooms.  These are young, vulnerable women, and I am stunned that this is how you do business!  To add further insult to injury, Cheri was rude and hung up on me when I called to confront her.  \n \nI have attached pictures I received of your \"attempt\" to email the 5 tenants to tell them of your intent to show.  Please note out of the 5 emails you sent, only 1 is correct.  Hannah NEVER received said email because it wasn't addressed to her correct name/email!  Cheri should have noticed that 4 bounced right back to her.  I have also received a picture of what I assume was posted on their door ... didn't it concern you that not one tenant emailed/called/texted you back to confirm?  \n \nI just had the displeasure of reading your (horrible) reviews on Google Reviews ... all 31 of them, and the theme is always the same!  I'm appalled you stay in business.  Taking advantage of young adults who are in college trying to get an education is not only deplorable, it disgusts me to my very core!  \n \nMoving on ... as I stated in my phone conversation with Cheri, if anyone EVER and I mean EVER enters my daughters private bedroom again without her EXPRESS WRITTEN OR VERBAL CONSENT, you will be hearing back from our family lawyer.  \n \nThe damage this unattended, yet frequently reported water intrusion/leaks has caused our child to have health issues relating to black mold, not to mention anxiety from worrying about these arising issues.  We are seeking reimbursement for deductibles paid out to health care providers for said issues.  \n \nFurther, because of said unattended leaks, I am, effective immediately, giving Hannah Manchel's notice of intent to vacate her room and return home so I can properly attend to the health issues caused by ignored water intrusion.   She will be out by July 1, 2017.  I am seeking hotel reimbursement for her from June 15th until June 30, 2017 as well.     June 1st payment was the last payment you will receive from us because of all these horrible issues you have forced my child to live with.  If there is a problem with this, I will need to know in writing by June 19, 2017.   Otherwise, on advice from our council, we are, effective immediately, putting in our request for early release from her contract with no consequences.  The last month's rent and the deposit we gave at the beginning of this nightmare is requested back as well ... I personally left that house in better shape than when they walked through the doors, and the contractor that helped us out the other day said there was black mold covering the entire home due to ignored water intrusion!  Again, this home is not a habitable occupancy for anyone to live in.  \n\n\nI am anxiously awaiting a reply back from someone other than Cheri by June, 19, 2017 before I take this issue to the next level.",

        "review": "There's probably 100 bad things I could say about lakeway reality. I lived in a large home with 5 other roommates and the house was built very cheap. Upon move in, while installing our internet we noticed a VERY bad flea infestation. So bad the carpet downstairs appeared to be moving. Fleas were jumping all over the hard wood floor, you wouldn't want to see the sticky traps we had to set. HUNDREDS of fleas. Quite interesting to experience this when Lakeway continued to tell us it was flea bombed several times. We had to buy flea bombs and even have an exterminator powder with harsh chemicals. It was almost a month before the flea problem subsided. The house seemed very nice with large spacious rooms and modern touches until you realize you can't even use the dishwasher properly. It would leak and leak on most washes. We had contacted lakeway to have a repair man check it out and they had said they sent someone who interesting enough never arrived. All of the appliances were faulty. The oven took forever to heat, the fridge would leak and the dryer would release moisture into the laundry room. Over all terrible. Not to mention the witch at the front desk was always incredibly rude to us. We were promised a smart TV with sign on to the lease and 3 of us had to call several times about the TV. Only to have an unexpected visit to the house from Cheri with the TV that was a brand none of us had seen and wasn't even Smart so we ended up not using it. We have all moved out and had just received our remainder of our damage deposit and feel we were unfairly returned what we paid. We were charged for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors that worked already, cleaning fees which are understandable and just a bunch of random nonsense which are all probably an excuse. You're all probably better off sleeping on the street before renting from lakeway reality.",

        "review": "The absolute worst rental agency I have ever dealt with....\n\nLast year my boyfriend rented a typical college house over on J street and it was a total mess. As a group of college guys, they were okay with the condition of the house when they moved in but definitely did not anticipate losing the entire deposit. Being as the house was in such a state of disrepair when they moved in and that an agent was present to conduct the move-in checklist, the boys were fairly confident that they had covered all their bases in order to get their deposit back at the end of the lease. \n\nUnfortunately for my boyfriend and his roommates, Lakeway made numerous false statements on their move-out ledger - claiming to have removed truck loads of garbage that were left at the house which was absolutely untrue. My boyfriend and I spend 2 entire days cleaning that house and left it exactly as it was received (if not better). Lakeway also made the boys pay for replacing furnace filters and installing a carbon monoxide detector which was not a part of their lease agreement.\n\nIn addition, the house was vandalized (with spray paint) during their lease. My boyfriend filed a police report and expected Lakeway to pay for the repairs with their own insurance policy. Unfortunately, they charged him for the cleanup regardless of the police report.\n\nAfter 6+ months of threatening legal action and endless unanswered correspondence, we have given up on getting the boys' deposit back. Lakeway and its management is a group of morally corrupt slumlords and I implore you not to rent from them. You will endure uninhabitable living conditions and you'll be extremely lucky to get your deposit back. They have almost nonexistent customer service and will do everything in their power to deny you your deposit. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!",

We were not given our deposit back, after our house WAS damaged due to a house fire that was caused by FAULTY wiring that was not up to code (this was not the first house fire at a Lakeway rental for the SAME REASON). We were displaced without anywhere to live because the house was condemned. They offered absolutely zero help to three students who had no idea what they were supposed to do in an situation like this. We tried for months and months after the fire to get our money back, but every time we went in to the office Dave Hansen who apparently is the only person in the whole office that can sign off on a check, was conveniently out of town, sick, at a funeral, I swear every excuse in the book. Right before we left to go home for the summer we thought we should give it one more shot. We signed and intent to vacate form that they demanded we signed even though we DID NOT INTEND TO VACATE and we returned the keys. Sheri, the secretary took the paper work and told us that Dave Hansen would have to think about it. EXCUSE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT?! OUR HOUSE BURNT DOWN.. yeah it was damaged!!!!! The house caught on fire because of Dave Hansen's cheapskate ways by not keeping the 100 year old house up to code. We could have died or been seriously injured due to his negligence. We were fortunate enough to be graced with the presence of Dave Hansen himself that day and he told us that we were not getting the deposit back because he thought WE caused the fire and because he was offended  because I told him that this wasn't the first fire that had happened through Lakeway. (boo-hoo sorry not sorry #FACTS) Then proceeded to tell us that the only way we would be getting our money back is if we took them to court. Honestly felt like a horror movie, all three of those lovely individuals were cornering us in the office  .. these people are crazy and honest to god criminals. \n\nFor your own sanity do not rent from LAKEWAY REALTY.\n\nDO\nNOT!\n\nP.S.

        "review": "DO NOT EVER RENT FROM LAKEWAY REALTY.\n\nLakeway preys on young college students who have never rented before. My advice to the new renter in Bellingham: first of all, DO NOT rent from Lakeway, and secondly, DO NOT settle for a house you don't want early on the year. Houses for rent frequently pop up all around Bellingham from March through August (if you're looking for a July/August/September Lease).\n\nAs for my story: My roommates and I had formerly rented a duplex from Lakeway. Lakeway time after time failed to come to fix the mold growing at our house (we literally called them the first day that we moved in), and when they finally did come, they just had someone PAINT OVER IT. Finally, we got fed up with Lakeway - after the ceiling collapsed in one of the bedrooms (a room which, Dave Hansen, the owner of the realty company, assured as was safe and fixed. The ceiling had collapsed the previous year as well). We terminated our lease.\n\nWe spoke to the tenants in the other half of the duplex we lived in, and they experienced similar, but even more severe problems that Lakeway, again, failed to fix. Along with mold, they experienced a strange stench coming from their house, which Lakeway did not investigate for some time. As it turned out, they dead rats in their walls. The decomposing animals made one of the tenants so sick she was forced to drop a class at Western. This eventually led to them threatening to take legal action, to which Lakeway FINALLY complied.\n\nIf you want more than just anecdotal evidence of Lakeway failing to fix things for their tenants and their overall disregard of safety: http://westernfrontonl...\n\nIf you didn't read the article: their house had faulty electrical wiring (which I wouldn't be surprised if Lakeway knew about and simply didn't fix), and Lakeway failed to fix their smoke detectors. Their house burned to the ground.\n\nI will say that the receptionists at the office are nice. I feel sorry that they have to work for such an awful company. \n\nAgain: do not ever rent from Lakeway! Don't settle for one of their awful houses early in the year if you can't find anything! Houses and apartments will spring up on Craig's List all year!",

        "review": "Man I had an unexpected, dreadful experience with Lakeway Realty. I own a local business and we needed a new place to live since the company is growing and we needed more room. I told them that I have a Doberman and a small dog (less than 10 lbs) during our first encounter (July 10th) and that if that presented a problem then I would move on to another house that I was vetting at the same time as a backup. They told me \"No, that shouldn't be a problem.\" They asked for a deposit check ($1800 including a $600 pet fee) during the aforementioned meeting, cashed it a day later(which was quite unexpected as we had not received a rental agreement or any of the required materials under Washington law), then waited 3 business days to \"process\" our application. They called us around 5pm on July 15th (after two business days of inquiry on our part for a decision) to inform us that our application had been rejected. When my business partner asked why, she said that the owner of the house had denied our application because of my Doberman. My business partner called back to inquire how long until our funds would be returned. She responded with \"It will take 7-10 business days while the funds clear the banks at which point we can mail you a check or you can come pick it up.\" The funds had left our account on Friday, July 11th. He called a third time to ask why they went forward with our application knowing the owner did not like Dobermans and knowing that we had one before the process started. After she put my business partner on hold for about 5 minutes she proceeded to change her story. She said it was not the owner who rejected our application but the rules established by Sudden Valley and that \"his hands were tied.\" She said Sudden Valley rules prohibit Dobermans specifically. This is simply not true. A simple Google search revealed that. I honestly believe they had no intention of renting this property to us. They simply wanted to earn interest on $1800 as long as they could and collect $50 in \"application fees.\" It wasted over a week of our house hunting time and our backup has since been rented. We will be pursuing legal action, if possible, to ensure that this nefarious company cannot take advantage of anyone else.\n\n\nhttp://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.260",

We have an awesome house near sehome haggens but the reason we are moving out is that we are tired of dealing with Lakeway. In the winter our roof started leaking and they sent out a plumber that ripped up the ceiling inside the house, who confirmed it was the roof, not only does it take them months to fix any problem they are rude everytime you call to ask if they could get anybody out to fix it. We had that hole in our ceiling for two months! Not a small whole by any means it was the size of our kitchen and our gas bill quarupled in those two months ($500 bill each month) We had to fight tooth and nail to be reimburst for the gas bills but we never quite got compensated for the entire thing. I had to write and send them a registered letter for them to even get someone out to start fixing the hole in our ceiling which was really annoying. What else? oh lets see we have a major carpenter ant problem they have done nothing about, I have had to buy ant killer and stray multiple times but nothing seems to work well. We are still waiting to hear back from them for that and i refuse to write another letter. In addition, one of sinks in our kitchen is not draining my roomates called numerous times but all they say is that they ll get someone out there and they never do.

Fleas were jumping all over the hard wood floor, you wouldnt want to see the sticky traps we had to set. HUNDREDS of fleas. Quite interesting to experience this when Lakeway continued to tell us it was flea bombed several times. We had to buy flea bombs and even have an exterminator powder with harsh chemicals. It was almost a month before the flea problem subsided. The house seemed very nice with large spacious rooms and modern touches until you realize you cant even use the dishwasher properly. It would leak and leak on most washes. We had contacted lakeway to have a repair man check it out and they had said they sent someone who interesting enough never arrived. All of the appliances were faulty. The oven took forever to heat, the fridge would leak and the dryer would release moisture into the laundry room. Over all terrible. Not to mention the witch at the front desk was always incredibly rude to us. We were promised a smart TV with sign on to the lease and 3 of us had to call several times about the TV. Only to have an unexpected visit to the house from Cheri with the TV that was a brand none of us had seen and wasnt even Smart so we ended up not using it. We have all moved out and had just received our remainder of our damage deposit and feel we were unfairly returned what we paid.

I was able to correct this but still, very conniving. Then on move out they charged me for about $1000 in fees for different things that I know for a fact were never done to the place as my friends moved into the house and I have been back there frequently since move out. They also falsified documents on my girlfriends house and tried to charge her $3000 14 months after she had moved out of her house. They legally only have 21 days to do this but decided to falsify some documents to make it possible. She also called the collection agency and apparently they did this to over 30 different houses. Luckily my girlfriend took them to court and only ended up paying about $750, but still, incredibly un professional. Also two years ago my friends lived in a house that was having electrical problems and they had asked lakeway to come and fix it numerous times but it was never done. The house burned down from an electrical fire a few weeks later and all of there stuff was destroyed. My friend had to withdraw from his quarter at western which cost him a bunch of money not to mention all of his belongings were destroyed and he was left homeless. Lakeway realty is the worst company I have ever come across in my life by far and they should pay for all of the terrible stuff they have done. Sadly college students dont know or care to deal with it, especially since its their familys money. Also a lot of the time there is no other housing and so they have to go with lakeway.",

Also, my ceiling leaked into my closet and got all my stuff wet, we had a carpenter ant infestation and to be out of the house while an exterminator came through, and the sink constantly leaked.  On top of all this they took money out if our deposit because according to them we turned up our hot water heater which is straight up BS.  Never rent from these guys EVER.

That was back in September, but we still have squirrels! We have contacted lakeway every week since we moved in and despite having an infant in the home, they dont seem to care about the infestation at all. I have contacted the city, housing advisors, pest control, housing inspector, and lakeway many times and no one is able to help us unless the landlord wants to help. Well this has been going on for months, and going to court is just about the only thing we havent tried yet. Best advice: avoid Lakeway like the plague their staff is super unprofessional, and they dont care about human beings only a paycheck. It breaks my heart to see people treat others like this, its shameful and grotesque. We have had many problems with the house: mold, water damage, animal feses, old water heater, broken dryer, broken heat, etc. but the squirrels take the cake. I contacted them last week to tell them we suspected they died because house flies showed up, but still they dont care. Lakeway is taking advantage of young people and they NEED TO BE STOPPED.",

EDITED FOR CHARACTER SPACES PERMITTED!\n\nShe immediately discovered leaks &water intrusion in her room, the bathroom upstairs, the bathroom downstairs, the kitchen,etc. How u can justify just re-renting a house that is leaking beyond my understanding.   I'm confident that, according to the Landlord Tenant Act, you are required to offer a home that is habitable -- living in a home with water intrusion & the black mold it causes is far from being habitable.  It's now June, 2017, & these students are STILL dealing with water intrusion, leaks, black mold & the health issues from being subjected to these conditions for over 9 months!   At one point, a handyman was sent to check it out, but never followed through on this issue. As were the several other attempts to resolve this problem early on!  As her landlord, certainly u r aware that u r required 2 offer ur tenants a clean & healthy place 2 live/breath!  This home is far from the habitable place that 1 would expect.\n\nI will address the water intrusion/leaks again below, but it has come to our attention that my daughter was walked in on in her private bedroom (usually padlocked when she isn't home) when Cheri was showing the place to future potential tenants the other day!  Months and months before their lease is even up!  As a parent in today's crazy world climate, surely you can understand how that would be completely and absolutely unacceptable!  I don't care what the circumstances are, or how many unreceived posts you posted, it is not acceptable to just walk into their private home and certainly into their private bedrooms.  These are young, vulnerable women, and I am stunned that this is how you do business!  To add further insult to injury, Cheri was rude and hung up on me when I called to confront her.\n\nI just had the displeasure of reading your (horrible) reviews on Google Reviews ... all 31 of them, and the theme is always the same!  I'm appalled you stay in business.  Taking advantage of young adults who are in college trying to get an education is not only deplorable, it disgusts me to my very core!\n\nMoving on ... as I stated in my phone conversation with Cheri, if anyone EVER and I mean EVER enters my daughters private bedroom again without her EXPRESS WRITTEN OR VERBAL CONSENT, you will be hearing back from our family lawyer.\n\nThe damage this unattended, yet frequently reported water intrusion/leaks has caused our child to have health issues relating to black mold, not to mention anxiety from worrying about these arising issues.  We are seeking reimbursement for deductibles paid out to health care providers for said issues.\n\nFurther, because of said unattended leaks, I am, effective immediately, giving Hannah Manchel's notice of intent to vacate her room and return home so I can properly attend to the health issues caused by ignored water intrusion.   She will be out by July 1, 2017.  I am seeking hotel reimbursement for her from June 15th until June 30, 2017 as well.     June 1st payment was the last payment you will receive from us because of all these horrible issues you have forced my child to live with.  If there is a problem with this, I will need to know in writing by June 19, 2017.   Otherwise, on advice from our council, we are, effective immediately, putting in our request for early release from her contract with no consequences.  The last month's rent and the deposit we gave at the beginning of this nightmare is requested back as well ... I personally left that house in better shape than when they walked through the doors, and the contractor that helped us out the other day said there was black mold covering the entire home due to ignored water intrusion!

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'><section><heading><h2>Disclaimer</h2></heading><p>This summary is generated by ChatGPT and aims to present a balanced view based on the collation of multiple local property management company reviews. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and provide a well-rounded article, please note that individual experiences with companies can vary. This article is only intended to be a tool to help readers find a property management company or rental property. As such, it should not be the sole factor in any decision-making process.</p></section><section><heading><h3>Good</h3></heading><p>When it comes to positive aspects in the user reviews for Lakeway Rentals, instances of satisfaction seem to be in the minority. A few users noted that occasionally, maintenance issues were dealt with in a timely manner, and there were some interactions where the staff provided helpful customer service. Some users also mentioned that their security deposit was returned with reasonable deductions.</p><p>Another recurring theme within the positive reviews, though sparse, was the company\u2019s efforts to address concerns when problems were escalated. Reports of a quick turnaround for some repair requests imply that, while inconsistent, Lakeway Rentals has the capacity to meet tenant expectations under specific circumstances.</p></section><section><heading><h3>Great</h3></heading><p>Amidst the critical feedback, some reviewers described instances of Lakeway Rentals going above and beyond with their service. Despite the challenges that many tenants faced, the reviews highlight the exceptional moments when the staff was attentive and responsive, pointing out that there is recognition of efforts to renew their reputation within the community. This has made some individuals feel confident the company is making strides to enhance their operational standards.</p><p>Few reviews also commend individual staff members who showed a professional and kind demeanor during interactions. A select few praised the company for their ability to handle inquiries professionally and offer an element of personalized care, suggesting that despite prevailing opinions, Lakeway Rentals has demonstrated potential to deliver quality service. These cases, while not representing the majority, indicate that experiences can vary, and some tenants have had favorable engagements with the company.</p></section><section><heading><h3>Bad</h3></heading><p>Several reviews indicate a pattern of poor customer service, with complaints about unprofessional conduct from the company's staff. Tenants have reported rude interactions, including instances of being ignored or dismissed when raising issues to the company\u2019s attention. The communication from Lakeway Rentals seems to be a mix of delay and negligence, often leaving tenants frustrated and without timely resolution to their maintenance concerns, as seen in the accounts of users who experienced prolonged unavailability of essential services like heating and working appliances.</p><p>Another common complaint among the bad reviews pertains to the conditions of the rental properties themselves. Users have experienced cleanliness issues and pest infestations from the onset of their rental agreements, which speaks to possible oversight or neglect in property upkeep and preparation for new tenants. The grievances extend to what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude towards upkeep and timeliness in addressing evidently significant problems, reflecting a broader issue of maintenance management.</p></section><section><heading><h3>Ugly</h3></heading><p>Quite regrettably, the ugly side of the user reviews for Lakeway Rentals paints a rather distressing picture. Accusations of the company being 'slumlords' permeate through several accounts, where severe negligence has led to dangerous living conditions, such as structures with black mold, water leaks, and outright violations of health and safety standards. Tenants recount harrowing experiences of their homes being practically uninhabitable and the management's apparent indifference to these serious hazards.</p><p>Further exacerbating the negativity are reviews alleging manipulative and deceitful practices regarding security deposits and financial transactions. Tenants have accused Lakeway Rentals of unfair deposit deductions, unfounded charges, and even fraudulent behavior. It is specifically concerning to note the frequency and consistency in reports of Lakeway Rentals not returning security deposits or charging exorbitant fees for normal wear and tear, issues that existed prior to tenancy, or repairs that are the responsibility of the property management company. These negative experiences greatly tarnish the reputation of Lakeway Rentals and highlight the need for serious internal review and potential overhaul of their business practices.</p></section></article>"
