        "review": "Only rented through OPS for a short time, but in that time, staff were pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient. I broke the lease because I found a more suitable home. I knew the consequences of breaking a lease (fees etc.) but with OPS and Julia's expertise, the transition was quick and successful. I'm grateful for the efforts of all those involved. Not enough folks write reviews when things go well. Thanks Ashley, Julia and the OPS staff!",

        "review": "\"Optimus Property Solutions? More like Optimus Prime of property management! As their IT vendor sidekick, I've gotta say, these folks are top-notch. Professionalism? Check. They sync up with our team like a dream. And kindness? Double check. When tech gremlins attacked, they didn't just stand by; they dove into the trenches with us, showing patience and support that would make your grandma proud.\n\nBut it's not all serious business. Their team has a way of making even the driest property management talk feel like a chat over coffee. They've mastered the art of being pros while keeping it light and human, which in my book, makes them property management rockstars. If you're on the hunt for a property management crew that brings both brains and heart to the table, along with a few laughs, look no further than Optimus Property Solutions. They're not just managing properties; they're elevating the game.\"",

Keisha is the worst person to work with she is very unprofessional she doesn't have any communication skills. I have been sending in request for repairs for over three years and they tried to make it seem like it was our fault. Never rent from Optimus Property Solutions. They wrongfully evicted us we our disabled and we were behind on rent. I refuse to pay rent for filth and black mold. We our now homeless because of Optimus Property Solutions. They should be called Optimus Property destroyers .",

She was very knowledgable and patient with us as she thoroughly explained the process.\n\nWe have used Optimus for several years, both as property managers and as a service to find and vet potential renters for our properties.  We have been very pleased with their services and highly recommend them.",

However, when washer and dryer didn't work to complete a single load, service was contacted immediately.  When the dryer was identified as non-repairable, a new one of a similar model was ordered and delivered within 3 days.  Housekeeping/ cleaning service hired to clean the home prior to move-in date did a horrible job.  They should find a different cleaning company.",

        "review": "Be careful if you rent a property through Optimus. They charged us $315 of our security deposit for \"general cleaning\" despite that we left the property spotless. The lease allowed cleaning only if we left the property dirty and we provided an extensive number of photos proving the property did not need cleaning (we spent hours scrubbing the house and leaving it clean). We asked them what needed to be cleaned by them and they were unable to answer that and said that since the cleaners were already paid there is no way to refund us. I would not rent through them again given what feels like a deceptive and dishonest business practice.",

She is professional, easy to work with, extremely responsive to our concerns, always cheerful (even when she is having a bad day!), and always offers sensible advice. Our tenants have never complained that problems are not resolved quickly. Thank you.",

        "review": "We've had our ups and down  (who hasn't with property management at a mobile home park?) but when it comes down to it, Julia has been an understanding and reasonable property manager, and not to mention, kind. She is always calm and clear with her expectations and that is vital as sometimes emotions can run a little high if issues arise! She is definitely very good at her job in that way, I can truly attest to that. I think lots of the issues we've dealt with in our park have been outside of the scope of Optimus' management of the park. While that's been hard to navigate, it's not their fault. She has shown that she cares and is willing to work with people, especially us. We know that she didn't need to be as understanding and patient as she has been with us over the years, and since our livelihood literally depends on it, we are grateful to her for sure.",

However we drove across the country to see a home that had a line of people already waiting, if I would have known that I would have saved a lot of gas and the yard hadn't been cleaned up to the point I couldn't really see what was going in on. Didn't get the house, but that's not any fault of Optimus",

I have been in PropertyManagement for 25 plus years, so I can say with certainty that this company is very professional in every thing they have done for us.  I've read all these reviews and honestly believe these people that make complaints have issues...not Optimus....  If you're looking for a rental, this is the best company to rent from, and if you're selling or buying...Julia is the best to work with.",

The lease was very straight forward and not in anyway overbearing to read. If we need to end up moving and we choose to rent again, I will look at what they have available first.

I'll say as soon as that happened my rent went up $200 and I'll say Julia was the worst person you can ever communicate with. We finally found a house we bought and gave them a notice of vacancy. Recently Julia came by  and was taking pictures of the house and my wife asked what's going on thinking it was the HOA. Unfortunately the reply my wife gets is \" mind your own f@#$ business\". So my wife takes a few pictures of her just in case and Julia stops her truck, sticks her head out and rudely shouts \"you want me to get  out and pose?\"  I then called and headed to the office to have a conversation with Gary I believe..by the time I arrived office was closed and no one was there @1pm.. interesting how 10 minutes was a hard time to wait for me to arrive? Since then I haven't had a phone call back or no answers of why Julias actions were so unprofessional and rude.",
