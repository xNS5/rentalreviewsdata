        "review": "Landmark appears to be only about the bottom line... more money.\nThey set up an online app for tenant approval that was a nightmare to use, especially for parents of college students. They had to get rid of that app within one year, but certainly didn't help those of us who were struggling.\nThe property is rundown. The rules about no smoking and pets are not enforced. There were bug problems that continued for several months. Smoke from neighbors smoking on their porches seeped into the apartment. There was a huge problem with the walkways along the 2nd story entrances. So many soft spots that I was concerned about dropping a foot through the walkway.  \nI think of all the time and all the phone calls I have made over the last year for different problems.\nThen, in the checkout process, we received approval to check out early. But this was never communicated to the Accounting department. So the Accounting department refused to honor the email approval we received from the property manager. We paid about $500 that they refused to refund.\n\nThis company seems very disorganized. And the employees do not seem very happy. Be very cautious if you decide to rent from them.",

        "review": "If 0 stars was an option, I would definitely give them a 0. I can't believe this place is still in business after my terrible experience living in Bellingham. I urge you to consider going to another leasing company for your apartment rentals/leasing if you plan on settling in the Bellingham area. I know most Yelp review pages for leasing companies will have negative reviews but I HIGHLY encourage you to read about my experience and consider going to another company when looking for Bellingham apartments/houses.\n\nWhen I moved into my apartment, I was appalled that they said that they cleaned and fixed the apartment. OK, I'm a pretty clean person but who says the apartment is considered fixed when there are holes punched into the door... Not only did we take photos of this but we reported this immediately to the leasing company and it took them 2-3 months for them to finally fix the doors.  \n\nNow, moving out I'm so appalled at this and to this day I am appalled. Our security deposit was around $800. We made sure the apartment was cleaned spotless, even better than when we moved in. Everything was fixed and tidy with no damages. We got back $24. All I said was \"LOL are you serious?\" I was so shocked at this. Did they change the carpets? Fix the blinds?  Redid the kitchen with this?!? We called so many times about this and they said they were going to look into this and we finally got an answer saying that there was damage to the apartment case closed. I'm so confused at this and still to this day as we left the apartment in better condition than before. In the end, fighting this for months after we moved out was not worth $300+ of my share of the deposit as we would always get told that a message will be taken and a call will never get returned to us...\n\nI've rented from now 5 places and this is by far the worst company I've ever leased apartments from. Even if you find the perfect apartment complex and it's through them, I want to urge you to find another place to rent from. If you choose to rent from Landmark, you better document everything with your phone (including photos and videos) of when you move in and out and ask for a final ledger upon move out. PLEASE PLEASE find another place. Now I know why the previous tenants left those holes in the apartment (see photos) and I would have probably done it too after all the frustration I faced leasing from Landmark.",

She always made sure that all of her tenants were safe from all of the homeless encampments where there was crime prostitution drug use and drug dealing including the massive behavioral problems that threatened each and every tenant. She always made sure that everyone felt safe to the point where everyone is happy to call the tollwood apartments their home. \nLandmark should be ashamed of themselves for not seeing the valuable asset of the on site manager that will always be remembered and missed.",

        "review": "Do not be deceived by the seemingly nice properties Landmark owns. I have been a tenant with Landmark for about 7 months now. The entire experience has been nothing short of frustrating and overall exhausting. We will not be renewing our lease here when the lease is up.\n\nI do not know where to even begin with these people. The property manager we deal with is Grace Macdonald. Both room mate and I have not liked this lady from the get go. We moved to Bellingham with the hopes of finding something nicer than our old place and we settled for the place we have now with Landmark. The apartments themselves are decent and fairly new, but the management makes it so that the apartment quality isn't even worthwhile.\n\nLet us start with how unprofessional the landlord is. Every other day or so, we get texts that sound like a third grader wrote them. We have been asked to basically spy on our neighbors and be snitches on each other for Grace. Everything, from literal begging and pleading, to how to park cars etc, is texted about all the time. It seems as though she cannot properly manage her property well at all. Do not think any complaints or maintenance you have will be handled at all. We have been waiting for our washing machine to be fixed for four months now. Still nothing from them. We have neighbors above who stomp louder than elephants and we were essentially told to suck it up when we asked if they could message the people about sound etiquette. But only week one into our stay and we already had Landmark messaging us to be more quiet.\n\nThe apartments are nice... in the winter and winter only. They are equipped with heaters in all rooms. But in the summertime, these apartments will make you feel like you are in a slow cooker. NO AC whatsoever. Be prepared to drop $400 on an AC unit for your place. The apartments are on the expensive end. 2 bed and 1 bath is close to $2000 every month, including all utilities. We are broke. the bedrooms are also small as hell. The security deposits and pet fees are outrageous too! Each cat is $500 and an additional $40 every month to your already ludicrously expensive rent.\n\nThere are no amenities at all. No covered parking, no garages, no pool, no gym, no clubhouse. You get the idea. What you DO get offered by Landmark is a gardening plot and paid parking spots. But, as the name suggests, they are paid for monthly. So, in addition to expensive rent, you can pay $60/month for a parking spot no closer than 95% of the parking and $30/month for a box of dirt. Money greedy.\n\nBottom line, living here has felt like being watched over by the Gestapo - Landmark cares solely about money and making their tenants miserably controlled. Never renting from these people again.",

        "review": "I have had the most frustrating experience with this company.  I applied for a 2 bdrm apartment in the SAME complex to upgrade from a 1 bdrm I had been renting for a year.  I applied on May 25th and did not get an approval until 6/24 to get keys THE NEXT DAY.  I had spent weeks asking for updates so I would know whether to start cleaning and packing.  Their stupid online application system makes it very difficult when getting an ESA animal approved...even though my dog had lived with me on an approved status for the last year!  My letter was 13 months old and they wanted one within the last 12 months.  The online portal was locked from edits, but Landmark would NOT accept an email of the letter.  The whole thing was NOT my fault.\n\nAnd then....with 5 days to move in record setting heat wave, I asked for an additional couple days to have a hidebed couch taken out by Habitat for Humanity.  They gave me until July 1st.  Not helpeful.  It is 8/21/21 today and my old apartment still sits empty.\n\nThen they charged me 6 additional days of rent in July as well as 8 hours of cleaning!  They place was awfully cleaning but for some cleaning residue and a few bits on debris on the floor that likely blew in as they opened the door!  \n\nI disputed the refund amount and got back half of what I was asking for accompanied by a bitchy email from Cherise.  Also, my coworker is going through the exact same thing with not knowing about approval DAYS before trying to move and many phone calls not being returned timely.",

        "review": "There are a lot of opinions about Landmark out there, I will leave my review based solely on factual occurrences: \n\n1. I moved out and moved into a new Landmark property. Well over 21 days passed and no deposit or statement of fixes was given. When I inquired after a couple months, they sent me a check for just over $10.00. I followed up with a demand letter for entire deposit citing the RCW they were blatantly attempting to violate, they refunded the full deposit within one week.\n\n2. When moving out of our last place after buying a home, I wanted to make sure they still had the move in inspection form we signed; they legally need to have a copy on file to be able to keep some/all of a damage deposit and they also are legally required to provide a tenant one copy when asked during that tenants tenancy.\n\nWhen we asked for a copy, we were told it wasn't available, it was filed away in storage off site, they had switched from paper files to digital since we moved in and they may not have it at all and they'd have to get back to us a different day, etc. After a rather large commotion and being threatened to have the cops called on us for harassment because we knew exactly what we were entitled to (we actually offered to call our family friend for them who is a sheriffs deputy on duty at the time, they declined) they conveniently sent over the electronic pdf of the document via email within literally 21 minutes of us leaving the office. Very impressive if it was indeed a hard copy only stored offsite like they stated. \n\nThere were some other instances of subpar property management, but these two situations told me everything I need to know about how they do business. There is a reason they are one of the worst reviewed property management companies in Whatcom county.",

In the past 3 years, rent has gone up $300 dollars and they claim it is for the property taxes, with as many units as they have in my complex, they more than quadrupled the rising property tax. \n\nMy first year, we put in a request to get the fan above our stove fixed. After being ignored for a month, we put in another one. Fast forward to 3 months later and we just fixed it ourselves because Landmark is incompetent.\n\nThe company does not care about the people that rent their units. Landmark simply wants to make money of college students and put them through the ringer. Constant threats made by employees were ridiculous and how they manage their properties is disgusting.

        "review": "Landmark is a bare-bones management company. They will fix little things in a reasonable time frame, but anything else takes weeks or doesn't happen. \n\nThey charge fees for everything. Be mindful of every entry because they frequently over charge. They do correct their error with a quick \"oh, sorry, our accountants must have made a mistake, we will fix that\"...but will do so multiple months in a row. \n\nIf you have fees noted in your lease (water bill, insurance, etc) be extra cautious. They charge many in   \"error\" and include a \"service fee\" for their entry of the initial fee being charged. The entry fee is only $3, but it's still frustrating to be changed a fee for them to enter a fee.\n\nWater management is also really sketchy. There's only one meter on the our four-plex, so they charge a \"water fee\" and divide the bill based on square footage and number of people in the house, but will routinely \"miscalculate\" and overcharge. Ex: We were charged $136 for one month of use in our apartment, and when we asked if we could see the bill they said \"no\", but noted that they had overcharged, and then lowered the fee to $90. We've since asked to see the bill on three additional occasions and they've said \"no\". \n\nWe will avoid renting with Landmark in the future.",

        "review": "When my roommates and I first started renting with Landmark in July, we were thrilled by the close location to WWU and low rent. This enthusiasm for this company has quickly faded as each encounter we have had with them has been both frustrating and the staff have proven to be disingenuous. \n\nWhen asked to fix the collapsing counter in our apartment, we were told that it would be taken care of. On further inspection after it was \"fixed\" screws had been put into the base of the counter, but weren't actually attached in place to keep it steady. On first glance it looked as if it was fixed when actually no support had been given at all.\n\nAs a company, Landmark has proven time and time again that it does not care for its tenants. Every exchange through this company has been through text, impersonal, and has always included a threat. When trees were being taken down in the northern parking lot, instead of being asked to move our cars we were simply informed that if they weren't moved by the next day they would be towed. \n\nAlthough that example might seem pretty innocuous, it's a behavior that is repeated almost every time we have any interaction with them. When rent was due recently, my account that is set on autopay originally took the money from my account, but bounced it from the system the same day. Instead of alerting me to this by email, call, or text, Landmark instead taped an eviction notice to our door. Once I fixed this error with rent we were then slapped with a fee of over $100. Now while I understand the fee the real frustration has come from trying to talk to staff at Landmark.\n\nCustomer service has been unhelpful and more willing to threaten tenants than actually provide a semblance of sympathy. I know I can't tell anyone where to rent from, but my experience here has been incredibly disappointing.",

        "review": "I was a tenant at a landmark property from November 2020 to September 2021. I am absolutely appalled at what others, including myself, have been through in dealing with these sharks. First of all, the main office is ridiculously unresponsive and you have to call them seemingly dozens of times in order for them to even reliably pick up and answer your call, even during stated business hours. Secondly, the terms in our lease at Sophia Place were ridiculously unreasonable. They can (and will) nickel and dime you for everything they possibly can. Want a garden plot? $50 security deposit and then $30 a month. Paid parking? $60 a month for a spot no closer than 95% of the rest of the parking spots. Also, be prepared to empty your bank account if you have pets, and the deposits are NOT STATED on the website. In case anybody was wondering, it's $500 per pet for a security deposit followed by $40 a month thereafter per pet. Speaking of prices, the cost of rent is absolutely unaffordable. By the time we moved out, we were paying almost $2000 a month including utilities and pet rent and all of that jazz for our 805 square-foot apartment. The base rent for Sophia Place got jacked up as well. It used to be $1500 a month for ours, and if we hadn't moved out, it would have been $1605 a month. Also, they do not do month to month leases. So if your lease is about to expire and you can't find another place to go, tough luck, you will have to sign for another several months, if not a year. It's whatever they decide. Also, forget about getting your security deposit back. You will never see it again, even if you make your apartment shine brighter than the surface of the sun. The staff themselves are extremely rude and sound like they absolutely hate their jobs, and the ones that don't sound like they are very clearly faking a positive attitude. If you can, please find somewhere else to live in Bellingham. It's sad that seemingly every other property in that area is owned by Landmark so it doesn't give you many options. Don't do it. Just don't do it.",

We tried scheduling through their online system and all three times Landmark cancelled the viewings without telling us. That's right THREE TIMES. The first time, it seemed like an arbitrary mistake, it was fine. Turns out we didn't need a reservation and were told when we called to just pick up the keys. The second time however we waited at the house for nearly half an hour and nobody showed up. We called. Turns out it was a mistake on their end. The house is still occupied and they never notified the tenant that people would be coming by to view the house. They actually apologized that time and offered to reschedule us for today. We graciously accepted the apology. Hey mistakes happen. We had a VERY busy day today and made it back to Bellingham, sleep deprived, hot and anxious to see the house and lo and behold, we waited another 20 minutes. Nobody was there. We called and the person on the phone was rude to US and blamed us for cancelling the reservation. There is no way we could have. We made the reservation over the phone. The person kept talking over my fiance and offered no apology, solution or explanation beyond that if the tenant doesn't want to show the property, they don't have to. OKAY, but I thought you just told us that it was our fault? \n\nALSO the house looks totally trashed from the outside. There is definitely potential and it was in our price range, but the yard is an absolute WRECK. Nobody has maintained that yard in perhaps years. From what we could see, the inside didn't look much better. Good riddance.

I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to some of the office staff as most were having to work from home and for the most part, they were polite to me. \n\nMy husband and I were moving back to Bellingham after living abroad, and due to the virus, were not able to see a unit in person. The website made it seem as if all tours were virtual at this point. We saw the pictures of a like unit online, which in reality looked very little like the actual unit. We applied and submitted a holding fee. I was not thrilled about submitting a holding fee before seeing the unit in person, but I was under the impression only virtual tours were being done at the time. \n\nDespite turning a holding fee into the dropbox, when I finally got through to someone around a week later, I was informed that my deposit had not been received and the unit had been given to someone else who had put down a holding fee. I found the receipt number of the money order submitted and despite the office not recording it, they had cashed the check and taken my money. After a few days of sorting this debacle out, they found my payment, told the other person there had been a mistake and gave us first dibs on the unit. We scheduled a viewing of the apartment, to which no one showed up from the office. I got a text afterwards blaming it on car trouble. We saw enough of the unit through the windows to know that it was insanely overpriced for both the area and the quality of the unit. We were homeless at this point and began looking for other units with other companies. Despite the fact that we never actually signed the holding fee agreement and they had made so many mistakes along the way, we had to accept the fact that they pocketed about 400 dollars from us for doing nothing. They had not even processed our applications until about two weeks later. It appears from reading other reviews that this is a common occurance with this company and that the pandemic is a good cover for shady business practices. \nThank God, we came across a private landlord who had our applications processed and a background check done within two days and allowed us to move in. Processing applications does not have to take weeks, be unorganized nor require a middle man to get rich on ridiculous fees. I would advise against using this company, as I would against most property management companies, but if you have to choose, avoid Landmark.",

After reading some of the other reviews (http://g.co/maps/b9hv7), I'm pretty sure it's the same shitty company.\n\nDO NOT RENT FROM THESE CRIMINALS.\n\nI'm reaching into the past to write this review, but considering this shady outfit managed to screw up my credit for several years I think it's only fair...\n\nWhen myself and two other tenants moved out of a house managed by \"Property Management Professionals\" we were given a bill that stated not only were they taking the entire $1000 deposit for the rental but demanding a couple hundred more on top of it.  The itemized list of charges was laughable; this was for a crumbling old house that the landlords had put ZERO money into for years (broken cabinets, faulty fixtures, filthy carpets, etc. when we moved in) and really needed a complete remodel.  \n\nGranted, our use of the space had added to the wear & tear so using some of the deposit money for repairs and cleaning was entirely justified.  Hell, even if they had taken the entire $1000 for this purpose we would have been OK with that.  The problem was that they demanded MORE money and each of us refused to pay it.  They threatened to send me to collections over the bill, and when they did so I received a letter stating that I had 30 days to refute the charges in writing.  You bet your ass I refuted those charges!  Did me no good, though: after repeated attempts through both Property Management and the collection agency to explain the situation and go through the itemized list of charges line by line I was completely blown off and told that I'd better just pay up or sacrifice my credit.  This being my first experience in such a situation I didn't realize what a mess that was going to be so I stood on principle and refused to pay their extortion money.\n\nWell, several years later I've found that NOT paying the $200 or so that this company unfairly charged me with no recourse has probably cost me thousands of dollars due to a lower credit rating.

        "review": "A one star review is generous. \n\nThough I thought I'd give yelp reviewing a go in the past, as evident by my one review, I gave it up - I didn't dig it that much. I feel this is a responsibility of mine however to divulge some interesting information and my experience with Landmark Real Estate Management.\n\nOur apartment complex, Civic Shield, was low end. We knew this heading in. It isn't flashy or particularly nice, fair. What we did not know was Land Mark's ramshackle performance of attending to our needs. \n\nUpon moving in the apartment wasn't even cleaned - we had to remind them of this. They sent a cleaning woman who spent a very reluctant twenty minutes at our apartment, repeatedly asking if she was done yet. She didn't do a great job.\n\nOur kitchen sink leaked profusely, and we had to have that fixed four separate times. Four times we had to have our master bedroom toilet repaired as well. The front bathroom sink needed replacing and the oven had to be fixed, and only one or two repairs were prompt or anywhere close. \n\nMost of this is excusable - apartment/renting stuff, no big deal right? I concur! What was problematic truly, though, was the insurgence of black mold. The apartment is built into the ground and in all of the rooms a bout of black mold started growing feverishly as soon as summer ended, and it was furious. We scrub it and use air filters and air out the room, but it comes back and back again. I believe this to mean there is mold in the walls, at least the foundation, and find this  unacceptable. To rent to people without proper inspection (giving them the benefit of the doubt here) is incorrigible. Landmark showed little to no interest in fixing this problem, but did manage to send a person to clean the mold a few times before finally using some sealant...on one part of the mold.\n\nMost disturbing is the following email, wherein I had recently called to let Landmark know that as they showed the apartment I would have no problem with letting potential renters know of my experience. Here is the response from my email, verbatum:\n\n\"If here is an issue with Landmark you need to come to us, not tell potential tenants about it. I have every maintenance request you submitted about the mold and every time we have addressed it properly and the way we are required to do so. It is not your place to tell anyone anything. Again, if there an issue you can address it with me in out office. If you have proof we never responded I need to see it in person. I have requests that show otherwise and I am more than willing to provide them to you. We have addressed all maintenance requests you have submitted. You are moving and it is not your place to tell anyone anything. Please provide me the proof that we don't respond. I know for a fact that maintenance is there right now fixing things because he just called me from there. I need the proof though please. You can drop it by the office by the end of today. I will gather our proof that we have and this will be discussed. Looking forward to meeting with you to review all of this.\"\n\nGranted I was incorrect in my assumption of there tardiness, apparently I miscounted, and we never did meet in person because of this realization on my part. There is no point in meeting to discuss their lack of haste and care for their poor property, but really what is interesting to me is \"It is not your place to tell anyone anything.\" Imagine if a burger place said, \"Here's your food, but it is not your place to tell anyone anything about your experience with our product.\"\nAgain stated later, \"You are moving and it is not your place to tell anyone anything.\"\nIt's like I rented from Bellingham's own mafia! Any ways, that's my soap box. Enjoy, rent wisely. They certainly are cheap, and we didn't die, so there's always that.",

Upon viewing a property today, we were the first to see it and to let the leasing agent know we wanted it. He waited several minutes to tell us that we needed to drive to the property management company to pay the deposit and apply. Had we known, we would have driven there immediately. Instead , people who saw the property after us got there first. Had we been told in writing or verbally immediately, we would have known what to do. Instead, we wasted time, energy and gas driving to the property management office where the people who came after us had already paid. The leasing agent should have had the authority to give us first priority  or at the very least, informed us sooner .",

I would go into more detail, however there are to many instances to choose from, and frankly I don't want to waste any more of my time on this terrible company. Please don't fall victim to this terrible leasing company. They aim to take advantage of college students, relying on their unfamiliarity with the leasing process to make money. \n\nWe are currently taking them to court; it is going to be a process we wouldn't wish  upon anyone else...

        "review": "Landmark realty is highly incompetent and have no grasp on customer service. From their point of view, every unhappy tenant is in the wrong, show Landmark even the slightest hint at your frustration, and they will break down and act like you are one hundred percent in the wrong and they should hold zero blame. Some examples to supplement my complete lack of faith for this company: Instead of handling late rent on a case by case basis and taking time to understand a tenants needs, this company has completely done away with a grace period due to the fact that in the past customers would always pay on the fifth. Great. Whatever. But when I pay my rent 24 hours late due to their servers not allowing my payment to go through, and I'm charged $134, that's absolutely ridiculous. They are also cutting a huge chunk out of our security deposit for an issue that was caused by previous tenants, and despite the fact that I sent in three maintenance requests throughout the year (all of which were ignored completely), I still get to pay for a problem that I can only help but think was charged to the last tenants security deposit to and they pocketed the money instead of using it to fix the problem. IF YOU TAKE NOTHING AWAY FROM THIS RANT OR CHOOSE NOT TO READ IT, THEN I HOPE YOU CONSIDER THIS: LANDMARK PREYS ON COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO RENT A PROPERTY AND HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO SIGN THEIR RIDICULOUSLY LOOP HOLED LEASES. PLEASE, DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND BACK YOURSELF INTO THEIR TRAP AND RENT SOMEWHERE ELSE... PREFERABLY FROM A TRUSTED LANDLORD BECAUSE THE OTHER BELLINGHAM REAL ESTATE COMPANIES AREN'T MUCH BETTER FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD.",

If your moving out of one of their rentals, don't expect to get any cleaning deposit back, no matter how well you clean before they inspect it after you move out. You don't know me, so maybe your reading this and shruging your shoulders, saying....\"yeah, she says she cleaned it well\". To any neah sayers....YES, yes I did clean it.....spotless. Even had two of my sisters to help me. Cleaned the stove top to bottom, even pulled it out and cleaned under it. Bleached all the bathroom toydies, scrubbed the skinks with bleach. Wiped down all walls. Cleaned all floors. Had a friend who was a landscape designer come help me clean up the backyard....sweep....power wash the patio. I'm telling you this place shinned.......A LOT better than when we moved in.....OH, and hired window washers to clean the windows....really, I did. They (landmark) came in, after we left, took a video and said the windows needed to be cleaned....the kitchen stove was dirty.....the bathrooms needed to be cleaned!!!!!!!!! SOOO, we didn't get one penny back. I would so never rent from these people again. They steal your money and never have the slightest intention of giving you any back. They basicly send in a person to inspect the house and make up lies why you won't get any money back. Why should you believe me....that's up to you. Go rent from them and see for yourself.

They charged me 45 dollars for having a desk on my back porch  and didn't even remove it, because it wasn't appropriate. They charged me 20 to drop off a late notice on my door for a fee that I was not even late on (the fee was delivery charge).

        "review": "The people in the office are nice, and my landlord wasn't absolutely terrible even though she was kind of mean, but there seemed to be really bad communication between the office, the landlord, and the landlord's assistant.  I found someone else to take over the lease, and she applied at least two months ago and still hasn't gotten onto the lease.  This was partially because her old landlords were difficult to get a hold of, but it also doesn't sound like they've been very good at staying in contact with her about that even though the landlord called me saying they hadn't been able to get a hold of her and was kind of threatening and mean when I talked to her on the phone.  My roommate talked to the landlord's assistant, but then it didn't seem like the landlord had heard anything about their conversation.  Since they couldn't get a hold of her most recent landlords, she submitted a cosigner application about a month ago and they still haven't processed it.\n\nThe main thing that bothers me is that I thought I had signed a lease extension form (and it turns out I had) and I went to landmark's office to talk to them about getting off of that, but they said they didn't have any record of me signing that form and that they just had a note on our place saying not to advertise yet but nobody signed onto the lease for next year and that I didn't have to worry about it.  When my landlord called me I told her this, but she said that she did have the lease extension form that I had signed.  Now I have to advertise for someone to take over in two months and I don't even know if they'll be able to get onto the lease in that long of a time.  It's a good thing I talked to my landlord or I wouldn't have even known that I needed to find someone to take over.  Really frustrating.

When we had an issue with the heater we had to repeatedly call to see what was going on with our maintenance request, then we were told that they were waiting on the owner to decide if it would be fixed, which it wasn't. Our lease stated that landscaping was included with our rent. After an inspection the property manager left a message saying the owner wished we would keep up the flower beds. I called back and left a message (of course she didn't answer) saying that shouldn't be our responsibility. I didn't hear anything back about the issue until 8 months later when we moved out and were charged over two hundred dollars for yard work. Two months later we're still trying to resolve the issue, but getting the run around. \nIn general Landmark is unprofessional, no wonder they have an F grading from the BBB.",

        "review": "In short summary: NEVER RENT FROM LANDMARK. Landmark Real Estate Management has been completely unprofessional and negligent to my roommate and me over the past year that we have rented from them. \n\n1. Though their office is nice and the younger staff are friendly, the older women in the office are rude and their property managers are lazy. \n\n2. Upon moving into our apartment there were a host of maintenence items that should have been taken care of before we moved in. We listed these on our move in inspection and also filled out a maintenance report. In addition, the apartment was not cleaned properly. The bathroom had grime on the walls, toilet, and tub. The carpets were so dirty they filled up an entire vaccum bag. One of the locks on our front door would not work and our mail box was broken. My roommate found a comdom in the closet, along with other more minor issues. According to Washington State Rental Rights, the maintenance items should have been fixed within 10 days. It took over two weeks for only some of these issues to be fixed only after we contacted them multiple times about it. The other minor issues were never fixed because about a month after moving in we had a major issue...\n\n3. The whole ceiling above our shower began to get moldy incredibly fast. We would clean it properly but the mold wouldn't come out. We sent in another maintenance request and this time we had to send them a formal letter that they were breaching renters rights by not fixing it within 10 days (took over two weeks of multiple phone calls and office visits every few days with no response from our property manager). By then part of our ceiling needed to be replaced and the maintenance man cut a hole, filled it with plaster, and just left it like that. We had to contact them again so that he would come back and finish the job properly. It should not have taken over three weeks to fix a mold problem. Aparently it was caused by leaky pipes from the apartment above.\n\n4. With that ordeal settled it was a few months before we had another maintenance issue. My main point is that their communication and lack of response with tenants is extremely unprofessional and unneccisarily stressful for the renters involved. It seems like there should be a better way to communicate... like with phone calls and emails about progress or notification that they received the request and will fix something within a certain time frame... or something. \n\n5. More recently we received a notice to vacate within three days on our door. Both my roommate and I were gone at the time for the week so we did not receive the notice which was only sent by mail and door posting that was only accessible at the apartment that we weren't at. It seems like for urgent matters like these a phone call would be in order. The notice was for rent. Aparently their drop box was broken into on the day that rent was due and our cash and check (paid with both, yes we realize that part should not have been paid in cash, however it was a Sunday, banks were closed and one of us was out of checks that had not come yet in the mail). The more professional thing to do would have been to send out a notice to tennants that the drop box had been broken into and that they were investigating the situation. What they did was tell us we had to vacate over two weeks later and we didn't find out until three weeks later in a panic over a phone call that we made to them. After inspection their office does not have security cameras and they stated that they were not responsible for anything the public does on their property. Basically, if you use that excepted method of payment and it is breached, you're screwed! They said they put a notice out on Facebook. Why would we ever like their page after our first few experiences? In the end, since we chose to put cash money in the box that there is a note on warning not to put cash into, we decided it would be in our best interest financially to pay the extra stolen rent money instead of hiring an attorney and going to court. That's in addition to the stress caused to both of us who are students working hard to pay for school. Since my roommate's check was stolen, my roommate needs a new checking account. \n\n6. Needless to say, we have learned a lot from this experience and know what to look for in the future. We will do our best to spread the word around Bellingham and hope you do too. \n\nCheers! :D",

I asked if she could send me an email with the new management company information and contacts and she straight up told me \"NO\" she would not do that.

When we did an audit of our current parking, we discovered that tenants in 1 and 2 bedroom units had been assigned several parking spots that were assigned to vacant 3 bedroom units. Therefore, we are reshuffling things to ensure that all our tenants have access to at least one parking space.\n \nPrior to making this change official, we made efforts to inform our current tenants about the change with a notice in October of the initial audit and again in December of the final change. Both notices contained information on the reduction of parking for 1 & 2 bedrooms and the alternative location to park on Byron Street.\n \nAs for maintenance, we are constantly working to ensure tenants would continue receiving timely maintenance services.\n \nWe are working hard at Southgate to make it an enjoyable place to live. Change is not always an easy thing to endue however sometimes it is necessary to improve situations.\n \nWe hope that you understand that these changes will improve customer service to our valued tenants.\n \n-Candace"
