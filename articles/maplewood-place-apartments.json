        "review": "Cheap apartments but you get what you pay for. Management not on site. They give no cares about any problems that arise(which many will that are most likely not your doing) and in fact they will  most likely turn it around to make it about you and how it's your fault and your responsibility. The neighbors alone will make you cringe. Noise at all hours, definitely drugs dealers who have people going in and out. Parking lot is beyond small for all that live there, good luck trying to even fit a regular sized car in those parking spots when it's full. Good luck not getting your car smashed or scratched because others that live there do not understand how to back out or enter such small spaces. Management does a horrible job at communicating all together to new tenants, so if you work late and the only spot you pay for has been taken by someone else. There's nothing you can do. Overflow is always full and street parking as well. So you're looking at illegally parking at the Free masons lodge across the street or miles away from your apartment. Enjoy the cold! It isn't until you ask management to get on the apartment towing list to be able to actually call the tow company and get a car towed out of your spot, not on your dime, when such things happen. But after that happens the first time, good luck not getting your car keyed. There are many who try to warn others about Apex, heed their warning, unlike me who didn't. I will be posting pictures of obvious no goes on this place.",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite the critical nature of the one available review, it is mentioned that the apartments are affordable. In some cases, tenants may perceive the low cost as an advantage, particularly if they are seeking budget-friendly living options. Additionally, affordability might allow individuals on a tight budget to access housing without a significant financial strain.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>However, given the singular review provided for this article, there are no specific repeat positive sentiments or experiences to report. Therefore, this article cannot substantiate any claims of great experiences from the user reviews for Maplewood Place Apartments at this time. Should more positive reviews become available in the future, this section could be updated accordingly to reflect any emerging positive themes or experiences.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>The only available review for Maplewood Place Apartments raises concerns about the management's responsiveness to issues, suggesting tenants' needs may not be adequately addressed. Furthermore, the reviewer indicates that problems they encountered, which appear to be unrelated to their actions, were unfairly redirected back onto them by the management. Poor communication from the management to new tenants is also highlighted as a significant issue, indicating a lack of clarity and support when it comes to policies and parking arrangements.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The review contains several distressing remarks about living conditions and community experiences at Maplewood Place Apartments. Concerns about noise levels, potential illegal activities, and cramped parking spaces, combined with reports of property damage such as vandalized vehicles, paint a grim picture. These issues contribute to an environment that is described as far from pleasant. The user review warns potential renters of these conditions and urges them to consider other options, emphasizing their regret for not heeding previous warnings about the apartment complex.</p></section>"
