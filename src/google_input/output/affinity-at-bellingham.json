        "review": "I had moved in right when I turned 55 into a 2 bedroom apartment.  Due to personal issues, I moved out, but returned since my first experience was fantastic.  Since coming back, there is a list a mile long NOT to stay here.  Number one; severe building issues such as substantial cracks in the hallways and in apartments which has been caused by \"building settling\".  This is a lie!  The building has been here for 7 years.\nRecently pipes had busted during a freeze.  We are being told not to worry about mold.  This is a worry - people can die from it.  They don't care.  Rents are going up through the roof!  Affinity has decided not to do anything about it.  And yes...they can decide not to take 80% of people social security.\nPool is broken 50% of the time.  Homeless walk around our apartments waiting for the chance to come into the doors. (which they have).\nSave your sanity and move elsewhere.  Do not waste your time!",

          "text": "Barbara, we certainly don't like seeing a current resident so unhappy. That's not what Affinity is about! Some of these items, we have been able to address with you via email and offered to discuss further in person or over the phone at your availability. We provided a letter with details on how we repaired the broken pipe and took measures to dry out and repair the drywall to prevent any additional moisture. To your point, mold is something we need to be proactive in preventing. We have a full moisture management protocol we follow when something like a pipe burst happens to prevent mold from occurring. Our regional managers have made frequent visits to oversee that this process was followed, and the repairs were done correctly. Our exterior doors are key controlled to only allow residents or their guests into our community. If you are aware of a door that is not operating correctly, please report this to the office. Again, we wish you had a better experience at Affinity this time. If there is a way we can work with you on a better experience, we would love that opportunity. Thank you, Lily"

Always smile and ask us how we are doing.  The group meetings are fun, serious and we ask questions, they are done how and when possible.  I appreciate Laurie's emails. It's very hard for me to get the mail everyday. The neighbors here are very special like none of the other places my husband and I lived independently.  It's a place full of fun, delight and homey with so much to do. It's fun to share when someone asks me how is Affinity. Thank You",

The community of residents are friendly and there are many ways to be involved and stay connected if you want to. The amenities have something for everyone from the pool, library, theater room (amazing!) wood shop, craft room, game room, billiards,  large outdoor fire pit, large BBQ patio space.. We have dogs and there is a wonderful dog park on site along with beautiful open areas to walk.\n\nThe location is prime with nearby shopping, Starbucks, Costco, and quick access to I-5. The rooms are comfortable with everything you need (including AC, which was a must have). The windows and slider to the deck are very insulated making outside noise unnoticeable. As you can tell, we're huge fans and highly recommend living here!",

There are usually monthly activities taking place. They maintain the interior and exterior of the building well. Sometimes individual apartment maintenance takes awhile. I find the individual units to be on the small size, but you can get a storage closet, or garage, for an extra monthly fee. Sometimes it is hard to find staff around, but when you do, they are always pleasant.",

Since the new manager came on board, facility upkeep and appearance are better than ever. We find the many amenities and services outstanding. Rent is a value because it encompasses amenities, maintenance, and utilities - including  satellite TV and Wi-Fi. In addition we can work out right here instead of paying for a gym membership.
