Home is not for sale, there is no interest in selling anytime soon and have ZERO interest in doing any business with them. Continued harassment will result in complaints being filed with local and state officials.",

      "review": "Irresponsible advertising techniques used to scrounge up business!!\n\nTheir \"3rd Notice\" postcard regarding \"the property at (my home address) due to some important things that have come up with the property\" concerned my teen son, (who had picked up the mail early in the morning), enough to wake me up, worried we were going to lose our home or had a serious urgent property issue happening.  More wording on the card stressed the importance of not delaying and multiple attempts to reach me.\n\nNowhere in the postcard was mentioned from which agency or company this \"3rd Notice\" on a bright yellow postcard was - just \"Alex\", a phone number and PO Box in Bham. \n\nCalled and it turns out they are a buy-your-house-for-cash business.  \"Alex\" was a woman's voice on an answering machine.\n\nNo thank you - I will use a bonafide Realtor (held to a level of professional ethics) when it's time to sell my home.  You don't need to stoop low and use slimey scare-tactic advertising techniques to drum up business.  I'll give my business to someone honorable who actually works for it.  Quit bothering and worrying people unnecessarily.",
