My boyfriend and I live in the Southgate apartments which are managed by landmark. We rent a 2 bedroom apartment and were promised 2 parking spaces, for 6 months we parked in our assigned spots and had no problems. In January more people starting moving in, and there for the parking lot got more full (the parking lot doesnt have enough spaces for tenant capacity) and we were told that they  finally had parking permits and to come pick them up. I went to get our 2 passes and they had the nerve to tell me that they \"reworked some things\" and now one bedroom and 2 bedroom apartments only get 1 spot and the 3 bedrooms get 2 parking spots. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO ANYONE?! There is no guest parking, no street parking, and literally no where else to park our other car. I mention that to them and the property manager tells me \"some people dont even have a spot, you should be thankful you have 1\" well b**tch our lease says exactly \"the tenant in allowed to have 2 cars on the premises\" so not only did they break there lease, but our other car has to be parked almost a half a mile away!! I have never dealt with more inconsiderate people and not to mention they never call back when you call them and one time I waited over a month for maintenance to finally come fix things for me, and I had to put in THREE maintenance request before they got around to doing anything. Im gonna say it one more time DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE OR YOU WILL REGRET

Jordan, this is Candace, the property manager of Southgate apartments, I wanted to thank you for your feedback and I am deeply sorry for the inconvenience around the parking at Southgate.\n \nAs you know, parking is limited at Southgate, after tenant complaints and confusion over who parks where, we are switching to assigned parking with permits.  When we did an audit of our current parking, we discovered that tenants in 1 and 2 bedroom units had been assigned several parking spots that were assigned to vacant 3 bedroom units. Therefore, we are reshuffling things to ensure that all our tenants have access to at least one parking space.\n \nPrior to making this change official, we made efforts to inform our current tenants about the change with a notice in October of the initial audit and again in December of the final change. Both notices contained information on the reduction of parking for 1 & 2 bedrooms and the alternative location to park on Byron Street.\n \nAs for maintenance, we are constantly working to ensure tenants would continue receiving timely maintenance services.\n \nWe are working hard at Southgate to make it an enjoyable place to live. Change is not always an easy thing to endue however sometimes it is necessary to improve situations.\n \nWe hope that you understand that these changes will improve customer service to our valued tenants.\n \n-Candace","owner":{"encid":"It_uCoHe_p0olnlf_p_p0A","displayName":"Troy
