From not deeming apartments unlivable for the sake of insurance so their tenants can have safe dwellings to letting people go weeks without power. I hope the city comes for this complex and every wicked and cruel person involved.",

          "text": "Hello, I don't see that you are a tenant with Village at Baker Creek, so I am wondering if you meant to leave this review elsewhere. If you meant to leave it on Village at Baker Creek website then you have been misinformed about the situation. There were 3 units that had a partial power outage, and it wasn't for weeks. It also wasn't the fault of Village at Baker Creek or staff. The power was shut off for safety issues by PSE and a licensed electrician. Over 100 feet of wire had to be excavated and replaced due to a manufacturing issue that caused the wires in the ground to actually melt. This work took some coordination and time because PSE, the electrician and the City all had to be on site at the same time to get buildings disconnected and then back on again once the work was inspected. You mention the City \"coming\" for the complex, but the City knew what was happening. The City inspected it all and signed off on it all. Nothing illegal was done. The wires in the ground needed to be replaced. We had to call before digging to get all utilities in ground marked before any work could be done. Vendors don't work 24/7 and every single vendor involved got to the complex as quickly as they possibly could to get the work started. Tenants were notified every step of they way, and even given updates during the weekend while the work was being done. As soon as management was notified that the power needed to be off for an extended time all tenants were contacted with that information. We understand the frustration with it all and wish there was something else that could have been done, but there wasn't and we followed every legal protocol we are required to. Tenants are required to have renters insurance for things like this. In case of an outage and a hotel being needed. The actual  full outage lasted a day and a half. PSE, the electrician and all other vendors work overtime through the weekend to get it repaired in a safe manner for everyone and get the approval from PSE to turn it back on. This was out of our hands completely. We didn't ask for this happen, and certainly hope it never happens again. Unfortunately, things do happen that are out the hands of staff and owners. This situation doesn't make the unit \"unlivable\" as you claim. We took care of an unsafe wire like we are required to do. Our units are inspected on a regular basis from the City and nothing has ever been deemed unlivable. We hope this clears up the misinformation you were told and the misinformation in this review. Have a great day. "

I have family that live here and we had some questions about some transactions going through automatically from their online portal my family uses to pay their rent. we didnt go in accusing anyone. We just wanted a simple explanation on the transactions. instead, what we faced was a furious, aggravated woman who used the F word and retarded. we still stayed calm and said we just wanted you to explain it to us which she did but while explaining she kept on getting heated. After our conversation I let her know I did not appreciate her language and she said that was my opinion, being hostile towards a customer is not an opinion it is a verbal assault towards us.\n\nRimple Kaur",

If you want to just live and let live then stay way from here. You have absolutely no rights and they will just walk through your apartment any time they like, whether you are home or not. They have the one key opens all units, and they use it whenever they like. Surprised someone from management hasn't been seriously hurt because some ppl don't take too kindly to that.",

If there is an emergency in unit, like a water leak, and the tenants aren't home, we ALWAYS notify them that there's an emergency and we are entering. The lease states for emergencies we can enter without notification, but we still notify people. If this truly happened to you, then please contact the office and have that conversation with them directly. Thank you."

The location is nice and our newer apartment building was nice and well kept up. The only issue we had here is we had our stove stop working and we were practically called liars from management.

        "review": "Im shocked by the things some people have experienced here. My girlfriend and I have lived here for a year and a half now. We moved in by taking over a lease. While the office did seem a bit disorganized during the lease takeover process, they were very straightforward about what we and the current tenants needed to do to complete the lease takeover. We had no problems whatsoever moving in. In the time that we have lived here, we have never had a poor experience with management. In fact, when the stay at home order began, we became concerned with how we would pay our rent. We emailed management and they simply asked us to pay what we could and that we could arrange the leftover on a payment plan. While that was unnecessary, we were very appreciative that they were willing to help. Overall, everyone will have their own experience, but I suggest that people at least give this company a chance rather than believing some poor google reviews.\n\nAlso, whenever we have had issues in our unit, maintenance has always been very prompt and happy to help with whatever we needed. All of our issues were resolved the day of or the following Monday if we reported it over the weekend. It is honestly a pleasure to see the maintenance man around the complex. He always has a smile on his face and a couple jokes to add as well. Of the 3 apartments we have had in Bellingham, Village at Baker Creek has by far been the best experience.",

The management, however, were the absolute rudest, the most passive-aggressive, unqualified, unprofessional staff I've EVER had to deal with in all my years of renting. From the constant rude emails, letters, texts and even being screamed at in person by the manager. They also always seemed to \"lose\" important paperwork/documents.\n\nAs for the buildings, all cheaply made and falling apart constantly. I've never in my life had to put in so many maintenance requests in because the structure it constantly falling apart. At one point, we had to have our ceilings ripped out because pipes connecting to the bathroom were not insulated properly and leaked through the ceiling. In the winter the insulation is so poor, that when it snows, icicles grow from windows and vents.",

Out of all the places we considered no place was as kind or helpful as VABC! Both Brandee and Haleigh have been amazing! We just got our keys this week and the complex is amazing also! Very nice location, close to the mall but just off to the side enough to not feel suffocated by the city. Overall the complex is really nice and well maintained. When we first made it into our unit there were a few things that needed fixed and had been left poorly by the old tenants. We filled out our move in sheet and within the hour we were reached out to and they set up maintenance to come in the next morning for us! I couldnt have any greater things to say about the team at VABC!",

They yelled at us for parking the moving van out of the way too. I'm just really disappointed, we were quiet and never paid late. Pretty sure they are just remodeling to hike up rent but trust me these aren't worth the money either way.\nEdit yet again: Google it no fault eviction is what we got you can couch this in any language you like to try and diminish fault, given no reason so seriously their response is poor damage control.

        "review": "We have been long time renters and this place has drastically gone down hill since the day we moved in. Ever since we moved in years ago we've been waiting on an ordered item to come in so that they could fix an item in our apartment. Years later, and after constantly bugging the leasing office, we are STILL waiting and the item is \"still on order\" to present day. Not to mention we have also been waiting on several other items to be fixed since the day we moved in that havent. We've literally just given up on fighting them about it.\n\nIf and when you need to fill out a maintenance form the follow up can take around two weeks or more for any response, let alone any work to actually be done. Even then, nothing is genuinely fixed. The maintenance workers slap a bandaid on it and call it good until the minor problem becomes an even bigger problem. A huge reflection on their low budget for maintenance. One time, we were even told to go to Home Depot, buy the item, and fix it ourselves. While I'm sure it's none of the maintenance workers fault directly, and more or less just cruddy management, the complex goes through maintenance workers quicker than a speeding bullet. So by the time that a minor problem becomes a bigger problem the new maintenance worker has no idea what the last one did and just manages to put yet another bandaid on the problem and leaving it for the next guy. It's not just the maintenance workers either. Receptionists here in the leasing office change every two to three months as well, which leads to even more confusion all around. It's a huge mess.\n\nLastly, for the longest time we were notified in our mail boxes if we received a package. However, since Graeme Dyehouse became apart of management we no longer receive any notification at all. We have had care packages sent to us by family that didn't get picked up for months because of the sudden change in management. No notification at all of this change either. He has been the major downfall to the management here at Village at Baker Creek. Very difficult to work with, rude, and has a \"I'm-better-than-you\" egotistical complex. If you can manage to, stay away and find a better complex!!!",

They do not care about anybody except themselves, they close down the office whenever without telling anybody, they send back your packages without warning you, and they do not care for your safety or wellbeing. During my time living at Village, they tried to increase my rent mid-lease and when I asked them about it they refused to fix the lease, reduce my rent, told me I was wrong and that if I don't pay it that I'll be late on rent and will have to pay added fees. Told management I knew my legal rights and they better fix this, so they agreed to look into it and get back to me. They never got back to me and forced me to hunt them down, again, and when I finally got ahold of somebody they told me they were wrong and it was illegal for them to try to do that. They also took over 2 weeks to fix my washing machine, same deal with my dryer when it broke, they try to charge you for others not following the rules, but when you go to report issues (such as being harassed by neighbors because they're drunk and disorderly) management refuses to do anything about it.

Once that was complete the respect and professionalism was nonexistent. When asked questions about issues with the residence they yell and scream at you then refuse to listen to the issue and hang up. I had lease take over, which was set to expire 3 months later. Rent was 1600 and they raised it to 1800. One staff member tells you one thing, then the next tells you something different. Upon move out and turning keys in I mentioned I wanted to be present for the walkthrough. I was told that wasnt possible. Then the next person says you needed to arrange that before the keys were turned in. My request was made at the time of turning the keys in.  After receiving my move out statement I was told to call the office on a specific number. I did just that. While waiting to be transferred, something came up and I said \"jesus christ\" completely unrelated to the call or a specific person. Heather picked up the phone and throughout cussed me out for saying jesus christ to her coworker and when it explained she called me a liar and hung up on me. The staff has no respect for clients, tenants, or themselves. The level of professionalism lacks beyond belief.  If you are on the fence about this company, it's for good reason and I'd strongly suggest finding a different mgmt company to find housing with.",

Pretty slummy actions on just the mgmt staffs end Location is great, could be a nice complex with competent mgmt.",

        "review": "Lived here 5 years, always paid the rent and bills on time,  never asked the management for anything except once to repair the broken washing machine...the washer - dryer unit finally got replaced with an older one after more than a month with no washer-dryer.. Didn't complain and just used it when I finally got it. I have been a homeowner and a landlord myself ... I cleaned the place conscientiously and thoroughly when I moved out, did not damage anything, including the walls, but still got charged a $125 cleaning and painting fee. (in addition to the deep carpet cleaning fee which was an expected cost).  When asked to explain the cleaning fee, the current manager was rude, disrespectful and nitpicking. In retrospect I should not have even bothered to take such time and care cleaning the unit before I left, since there was no appreciation expressed and they only look for ways to keep your money however they can. Not impressed. Bad management and interpersonal skills. My car was broken into, parked in front of my unit, and things were stolen... after reporting it to the management, they agreed to notify the other tenants, but they did nothing. \nDon't expect to get back your security deposit and don't expect to be treated in a courteous or professional manner if you ever have to ask the management about anything at this complex. So glad to have moved out and bought my own place now. I hope the manager learns some management skills and how to be courteous with people. And lesson learned: don't bother cleaning the unit when you move out because you won't get your rightful security deposit back, anyway.",

        "review": "The worst experience ever! During a lease take over the management leaves the negotiation up to the tenants. This caused some problems because no help was received during the whole process. When I went to to the office to sign for the lease the manager YELLED at me and the current tenant \"You have been a waste of my time\"... Now that I am the tenant nothing but horrible manners and service from the manager.\n\nThe apartments are new and nice but the management is so bad I recommend others to reconsider and look for other places because they can ruin your experience living there.",

        "review": "Management is the worst here that I have ever seen. They do not care about anybody except themselves, they close down the office whenever without telling anybody, they send back your packages without warning you, and they do not care for your safety or wellbeing. During my time living at Village, they tried to increase my rent mid-lease and when I asked them about it they refused to fix the lease, reduce my rent, told me I was wrong and that if I don't pay it that I'll be late on rent and will have to pay added fees. Told management I knew my legal rights and they better fix this, so they agreed to look into it and get back to me. They never got back to me and forced me to hunt them down, again, and when I finally got ahold of somebody they told me they were wrong and it was illegal for them to try to do that. They also took over 2 weeks to fix my washing machine, same deal with my dryer when it broke, they try to charge you for others not following the rules, but when you go to report issues (such as being harassed by neighbors because they're drunk and disorderly) management refuses to do anything about it. This management is the sleaziest, sketchiest, careless bunch of people I have ever met. Rent at your own risk, do not recommend it here.",

The management office was totally disorganized and their staff was always changing.  The staff never was able to give you a straight answer on anything.  When I finally moved out, they never sent me my deposit even though they sent mE a letter indicating that they would.  They refused to talk with me after telling me the check totaling hundreds of dollars was sent, but NEVER ARRIVED!!!!  DON'T BE FOOLED!!!",

    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Village at Baker Creek has received some positive praise from a subset of its tenant base. User reviews have mentioned helpful management in some cases and prompt maintenance services, which are highlighted as positives for the community. For instance, some tenants have reported satisfaction with maintenance requests being resolved swiftly, often the same day or the following day if reported on a weekend. Furthermore, there are acknowledgments of the complex's favorable location near the Bellis Fair mall and its well-maintained site, providing an ostensibly enjoyable living environment for some residents.</p><p>Additionally, specific user reviews have mentioned welcoming and friendly interactions with certain staff members, particularly front desk personnel who have offered assistance and eased the lease takeover processes. This demonstrates instances where the staff have had positive interactions and have been accomodating to residents' concerns and requests.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>There have been instances where the Village at Baker Creek has shown exceptional service which merits its own accolades. Some reviews indicate that residents have found the property to be tranquil and the management accommodating, especially during challenging times such as the onset of a stay at home order. In this particular scenario, management showed flexibility with rent payments, suggesting an understanding and willingness to support tenants through financial hardships. This gesture of kindness and consideration has been highly appreciated by some individuals.</p><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the positives, there have been criticisms leveled at Village at Baker Creek that cannot be ignored. User reviews have revealed concerns over the professionalism and consistency of the management staff. Residents have mentioned experiences of unprofessional behavior, including being yelled at and receiving threatening notices. Furthermore, tenants have reported issues around the upkeep of the older units and the parking situation, which appear to be ongoing and unresolved concerns that detract from the quality of living at the complex. The frustration with management's handling of these concerns is evident in the reviews.</p><p>In addition, there have been negative experiences related to the return of security deposits where tenants felt that the deductions were unjustified, particularly after leaving the apartment in a clean condition. This has led to a sense of distrust towards the management's practices, as expressed in the detailed accounts of previous tenants. Such experiences underline the need for transparent and fair management-tenant practices.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The ugliest side of Village at Baker Creek, as detailed in multiple user reviews, pertains to a perceived lack of empathy, transparency, and professionalism by the property management team. From tenants feeling disrespected and verbally harassed to allegations of mishandled paperwork and miscommunication, there's a theme of deep dissatisfaction with the way the complex is managed. Incidents such as unsolicited entry into apartments and management's seemingly arbitrary enforcement of complex rules paint a bleak picture of respect for tenant rights and privacy.</p><p>Further exacerbating the sentiment of discontent are claims of neglecting maintenance issues that compromise the integrity and habitability of living spaces, including the serious allegation of untreated mold growth. Residents feel their feedback and complaints are not adequately addressed, leading to a breakdown in the landlord-tenant relationship. These aspects represent the most critical areas of concern that the management at Village at Baker Creek would need to immediately address to improve tenant relations and the reputation of the property.</p></section>"
