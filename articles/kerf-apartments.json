Xfinity repairman came and quickly identified and fixed the issue with the modem/router in my apartment. I took him down to explain it to Josh as it may be an issue with numerous apartments. Security seems quite robust and the new facility is very nice.",

I have been looking at places to rent that have all the amenities I desire and am moving out of state so dont have the luxury to view in person. She did a FaceTime with me and went above and beyond showing me every unit I had questions on (which were a few, sorry and thank you!!).\n\nI also was able to see all the common areas/amenities. While theres still some kinks to work out, shes made me feel confident they will deliver on what they promote. Everything is brand new and Im so excited to call this place home in a month with my two pups!  Im big on reviews, **especially** when looking at apartments/property mgmt companies and even more so when out of stateso I hope this helps someone else take the plunge bc trust that I will update this review to keep potential neighbors informed if anything becomes a major issue! Thank you ",
