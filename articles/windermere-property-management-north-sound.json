We have used property management companies for many years now in several cities. We know that the caliber of companies can vary greatly. The  proactive and professional service provided by this team far exceeds any of our previous experiences. Would recommend them highly.",

        "review": "We used Windemere as our property management for three years. They were difficult to get ahold of and used different 'associate' managers, so there was very little consistency. That would have earned them a three star rating. But when we returned to our property, we were very disappointed with the condition of our home. Even more shocking was that they were willing to return the entire damage deposit to the renter despite obvious damage to our home (holes in drywall, smashed remote, etc). It became an exhausting process of emails back and forth. My 'favorite' part was having to digging through year of receipts to prove to 'my' property manager that I wan't lying when I said I'd purchased new stove knobs for the renter. I enthusiastically do not recommend.",
        "owner_response": {
          "text": "I was able to pull up the account and see it was eight years ago. I did address this with you at the time and unfortunately we had to 'agree to disagree'. I still stand by the deposit refund that was issued but understand you still feel the tenant was not charged enough. I am sincerely sorry, but I am governed by Washington State Landlord Tenant Laws and I charged for all items legally allowed (items that were above normal wear and tear). I do wish you didn't have a negative opinion of Windermere Property Management but it is your right to harbor your feelings. This is simply a situation I am not able to rectify."

        "review": "Rented an apartment from them for a year and decided to move into a house after my lease was up. Never in my life have I ever had a rental company keep all of my deposit. Long story short, they fired the manager, ignored my calls and 4 months down the road I talked to a construction crew member that repaired an area with water damage, in the apartment I had rented , keep in mind that I complained 6 months after moving in that I could hear dripping Every time the apartment above me ran their dishwasher. I've asked around and come to find out: not many renters like them or have received a deposit back --minus of course the usual charges for move out cleaning--. I truly hope the new staff has fixed this issue.",

Our records do not show you as a tenant in 2018 and our staff consists of only 2 people; both of us with the company multiple years. I take client satisfaction very seriously and am always here to discuss any concerns but again I do find you in our system. What town is the rental in?"

Customers appreciate the staff for being prompt and professional, responding quickly to maintenance requests and needs. For instance, one user noted the clarity in the setup process, which made transitioning into their rental property a seamless experience.</p><p>Another common theme in user reviews is the effective management of rental properties, with several clients reporting successful long-term relationships spanning over a decade. One client emphasized how the management team maintained regular inspections and addressed maintenance issues effectively, indicating a proactive approach to property care. Such consistent service has garnered the company's reputation for reliability among landlords and tenants alike.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>A look into user reviews reveals that many clients have not only had satisfactory experiences but found Windermere\u2019s approach to property management to be exemplary.

Many users reported getting their full security deposits back, a testament to the management's fair handling of property conditions.</p><p>User reviews often highlight how the company has moved to improve its operational processes. With managers being described as friendly and respectful, satisfaction among clients regarding communication and problem resolution remains notably high. The consistent praise for the team suggests a well-functioning unit committed to service excellence and tenant satisfaction.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the positive feedback, some user reviews indicate areas where Windermere Property Management may fall short. A notable concern revolved around inconsistent communication and management changes. One individual expressed frustration over having to repeatedly justify property repairs and expenses to different managers who came and went, which created a lack of continuity in service.</p><p>Some tenants have expressed dissatisfaction regarding their experience with security deposit returns. A review mentioned a situation where considerable damage was overlooked, raising concerns about the management\u2019s assessment practices. Such inconsistencies can lead to frustration among clients who expect a more standardized approach, showcasing room for improvement in their operational procedures.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>User reviews indicate a stark contrast in experiences for some previous tenants, leading to grievances about the handling of security deposits. One particularly negative review recounted a situation where the management company returned the full deposit to tenants despite clear property damage, leading to disappointment and exhaustion in resolving the matter while proving prior investments in the property. This experience speaks volumes about potential gaps in the management\u2019s oversight of property conditions.</p><pFurthermore, another review reflected a dissatisfaction with management\u2019s responsiveness to maintenance issues, claiming that concerns went unaddressed for extended periods. These experiences are troubling and may deter potential clients from trusting Windermere\u2019s property management services, as they raise fundamental questions about accountability and operational transparency.</p></section>"
