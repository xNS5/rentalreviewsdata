        "review": "Take the reviews into serious consideration before renting from PTLA.  I can honestly say, only rent from them if you have absolutely have no other choice.  I knew going in it wouldn't be a great experience...but didn't expect it to be as bad as my experience was. Now of course, they manage many different properties all over the county so they differ from location to location... but the blatant neglect of the new building I lived in, not giving me any other option to relocate when they were dealing with drugs/homeless living in and intruding the building, theft/vandalism... I actually questioned the humanity of the employees they had working for them, I truly don't understand how they treat tenants the way they do and go home to their kids and sleep at night.  I got my final move out and just like another recent review, they'll rake you for everything they can... they charged me for lightbulbs and smoke detector (I replaced lightbulbs in the place on my dime during my time there and the smoke detector was fine, actually tested earlier in the year when they did building inspections.) I am so relieved to not be under PTLA anymore, good riddance. Stay far away from them.",

        "review": "I have had multiple problems with this management only over the span of 6th months:\n\nMove in:\n- We were supposed to move in September 1st. We got an email the day before that nobody will be working Saturday September 1st through Tuesday September 2nd, due to Labor Day. We called and called explaining that all of our things are already packed and ready for move in tomorrow and they just kept telling us that we couldn't until the 3rd. We finally got in contact with someone who worked with us and we moved in as planned.\n\n- PTLA left a notice on our door that one of my roommates didn't pay rent. She paid 2 days before we received the notice. The money was taken out of her account and the payment bounced on their end. My roommate called and the people she talked to were vague and said that they would take care of it. 5 days go by and a late fee was initiated. She called again to receive the same answer as before. She got an email later saying they resolved it and took no fault.\n\nParking and management attitude:\n- Day of move in we were given our assigned parking. One of the spots does not exist. I was told just to park in the 15-minute spot by the person who worked with us to get our move in date situated. Few days later building receives an email that no one can park there. I called and left voicemails with no response. I had to catch a manager on site (don't count on them being there during the time on the office hours sheet) and they walked me through all lots and pointed at the \"guest spots\" that I could park in.\nI continue to park in the spots she indicated and get back from school to my car being towed. Costed $546 plus the money I lost from having to call out of work. I call and go into the office and explained my situation with parking since move in. She continues to interrupt and tell me I need to be parking in my assigned spot, the one that doesn't exist. She pulled out a list of all the parking spots and which apartment they belong to and tells me that spot is there because she walked the lots and took note of them. I take a video of the lot, showing that spot isn't there, come back and show them and again take no fault. They continue to tell me I was parked in an assigned spot and that I didn't have it in writing that I was told I could park there.\n\nOverall:\nI do not recommend leasing with this management. Managers were condescending, interruptive, and rude. No emails or voicemails responded to, not on site when they tell us they're supposed to. I will not be leasing with them again.",

I rented a carpet cleaner, dusted all light fixtures, sprayed and wiped down every inch of that appartment and back porch.  It was emaculate.  Never got my deposit back and was hit with a cleaning fee after it was all said and done.  No explanation or anything.  When they're done with you expect to get screwed.

        "review": "I rented from PTLA for a little over a year and didnt have a good experience overall. Shortly after moving in, I received a notice on my door that I hadnt paid rent. I had paid before I moved in. I tried contacting the office for two days, left multiple messages, and no one returned my call. I had to go into the office to talk with somewhere where I was treated rudely and had to tell the staff to stop treating me like they were. I did end up sitting down with the head manager at the time and she worked through the situation with me. From my experience, people dont return your call and you have to physically go into the office if you need any type of response you cant get from the on-site manager (if there is one) at your property. Overall, I didnt have a good experience working with the staff and management at this company and would not recommend renting from them.",

They helped me get an apartment in a very difficult renting climate in Whatcom county. They handled a difficult situation with dignity that necessitated immediate move out without charging unfair fees. I am happy with their professionalism. From the moment I applied to the moment I moved out, they were there for me every step of the way and actually returned calls in a timely manner. Julian was the BEST!

        "review": "As a parent to one of the residents at The U Apartments, I wish I could rate this as a zero. We did a tour of the U in Feb 2024. The apartment walkways had 4 x4s supporting the walkways. We met with one of the management people there, who forgot that we had an tour appointment. We asked about the supports and she said that PTLA took over the property in late 2023 and the inspectors pointed out that the walkways needed to be fixed and PTLA has plans to fix it during the summer, before fall quarter starts. The boys agreed to sign the lease. Since March till Sept 2024, I've been communicating with PLTA with questions and about if the construction is still on schedule for the summer. I kept getting mixed answers. Some said there were no plans and others said that they didn't know. Fast forward to move in date, Sept 2024. Construction started not too long ago. It was difficult to move since there were rafters everywhere. My son's room, which is the smallest, one of the windows had plastic over it. The closet door was off it's track. It looked like it has been like that for a while. Appliances are old. They had a long list of damaged items for their damage list. The construction noise was unbearable, especially when they start at 8:00 am. And very inconvenient to work around the many notices to enter, which majority of the time, they didn't enter till the last day. The first weekend they spent there, someone pulled the fire alarm at 2:30 am and all the residents evacuated. It was raining really hard and they couldn't get back into the apartment until the fire department got a hold of PTLA, which took about 30 mins after the fire department took 15 minutes to get there. I can't image if it was a real fire, the place would of burned quickly with all the plywood and construction equipment in the front parking lot, the fire trucks would have a difficult time fighting it. There would be no way for the residents on upper floors to escape. PLTA seems to have an \"I don't know\" attitude when it comes to answers or maintenance requests, which there were many in the two months they have been living there. It's very frustrating dealing with them, even as a parent. Maybe their other properties is 1/2 a step above The U Apartments. But they should have not let people move in with all the construction chaos and broken or falling apart things at The U. It's ridiculous. Not even the Corporate offices has contacted me after emailing them. All they care is making over $3,275 per month, not including utilities for a run down 4 bedroom apartment.",

        "review": "Moved in with my two roomates this month. On arrival we saw the construction with no prior warning, except a $250 gift card with minimal context concerning construction. The only stairs we were able to use the first two weeks and for move in were scaffolding. September 20 at 10:30 am with no warning from management both me and my roomates windows were removed while we were in our rooms. Since our windows were removed they have not been fully reset back into the wall allowing for the construction noises to be noticeably louder than before starting at 8am. The week after we were sent emails and flyers about removing our windows the following day and being legally obligated to inform us when they had not previously. Last Friday two hours after the management office closed we were informed if we needed to leave our apartment Monday through Wednesday between the hours of 8am to 5pm we would not be able to unless we left at 8am and were gone until 5pm. We have not been able to contact the office as they send every call straight to voicemail and when they do pick up they send you on a wild goose chase to the next phone number.",

A neighbor was doing renovation work and blasting music late at night over a period of months; all PTLA had to do was send an email to the condo manager and they would deal with the issue, but instead PTLA kept saying \"we'll get back to you\" and never did. I was forced to move and I'm so grateful that I have a friendly, responsive landlord now, and not a parasite like PTLA. You've been warned.\n\nUpdate: PTLA's response says to give their office a call. They never returned any of my phone calls when I was renting from them.",

        "review": "Ive had thirty-one years of experience as a renter. Judging by the reviews on this site and the one before it when PTLA took over from APEX, many people have had bad experiences with this company. However, in leaving a review, I have to go by my own experience, and in general my wife and I had a comparatively decent one with PTLA.\n\nOn the downside, I did not appreciate the fifty-eight page lease designed, above all else, to protect the legal interests of PTLA and building owner. I also didnt like the background check and the disclosure of personal information. Move-in did not go as smoothly as I hoped because the elevator was out, and there was no hope of getting it fixed before the movers arrived that day. Finally, we found the apartment had a number of functional problems when we moved in: one faucet in the bathroom tub didnt work; one set of blinds were stuck in the up position; a bathroom fan was broken; a garage door opener didnt work; and a toilet didnt work properly and didnt have a safety shut-off valve.\n\nOn the upside, we found that the PTLA maintenance team responded quickly, and all problems were fixed in a reasonable amount of time. This was true of subsequent problems, as when the garage door became stuck when someone hit it with their vehicle. My recommendation is that tenants submit maintenance requests through the portal and attach photographs. That worked for us.\n\nAlthough the lease was long, it also made it pretty clear that tenants were not allowed to create noise disturbances. In general, the building was adequately managed, though the grounds were littered with trash which no one ever bothered to attend to.\n\nMove-out went smoothly. We were leveled relatively small charges for minor cleaning and painting, and as a result we received most of our deposit back. This seemed fair to us. We also werent charged for carpet cleaning because we left the carpet in good condition. This was also fair.\n\nIn general, there is room for improvement in PTLAs management, and I hope this review is seen as constructive. If youre planning to rent in Bellingham, you should look around and consider your options. PTLA, in our experience, is a reasonable option.",

We moved into the brand new Crescent building that had and still has more issues than they know what to do with. If you can even get a hold of someone in their office they'll just play dumb and act sorry. Maintenance issues do not get addressed. Take your money elsewhere. They were and are not willing to work with us when we had unexpected life-issues come up forcing us to move, they just care about getting their overpriced rent. Maintenance and snow removal are non existent, this past snow storm the sidewalks and parking spaces weren't touched. Sidewalks were not walkable, and the front door doesn't open so tenants were supposed to walk around the building on ice-covered sidewalks to get inside. One of the two elevators has been broken 6 of the 8 months we've lived here. Heating systems inside units aren't able to keep up, and they won't heat or fix the heat in the buildings hallways and common areas so our electric heat has to run 24/7. The units do not get warmer than 60 degrees. The \"Leasing agent\", Kylie, lied upon move in claiming the units have A/C. They do not. My fault for not checking, I guess I should have known I was being lied to. Winter temps are no warmer than 60 inside while summer temps are 90+ on the 5th floor. I guess I had decent expectations for almost $2000 a month  The grass was never cut in the summer, and poison plants were found around the building that are fatal for dogs. This once again was not taken care of. The walls are very poorly soundproofed so noise and music from neighbors goes right thru falls.\n\nUPDATE 01/06/2023\nPTLA HAS NOT reached out, instead someone got upset that the front door has been faulty for quite some time now, forcing everyone to walk around. The only handicapped door that is. And now someone ripped the door handle off. Id imagine this will take months for them to fix as well. Once again, do not rent here.\n\nUpdate 01/30/23\nThe streetlights and exterior walkway lights have been out for over a week now. You can hardly see anything in the parking lot or behind the building, must walk with a flashlight. Just a matter of time before all the local Bellingham tweekers that live in the woods next to the building come out and start smashing into car windows to steal stuff now that they dont have to worry about streetlights. Have to assume PTLA just hasnt paid the bill, theyre cheap (obviously).",

PTLA purchased my property recently and Ive had nothing but issues. They wont take off additional charges for renters insurance when I have proof of my own that Ive had since before they took over and a huge lack of follow through. I accidentally locked myself out with my dog and laundry and they made me call a locksmith on a Saturday morning.

        "review": "I have been trying for days to get in touch with anyone in the office. Our hot water froze during the last cold snap and because of a design flaw the pipes ran in an exterior wall. The only solution was to put a small heater in the garage and it took 3 days for the weather to warm up and the pipes to thaw. By law they have 24hrs to find a solution. Secondly, I live in a 3 story townhome with the lower level consisting of a bedroom/bathroom and entry way. On a normal winter day the temperature cannot get above 62 degrees with full heat going. When it was cold outside it was 48 degrees on that level, I had to move my daughter out of her room and upstairs. On the upper 2 floors the the heat also struggled in the cold with the max heat being 62 on the very cold days. In speaking with others in the same type of unit in my complex they are also having the same difficulties with heat. This is a design flaw and cannot be rectified easily. PTLA has violated the tenancy law but not rectifying the situation in a timely manner. I have put in my notice to terminate my tenancy after 3 days of no hot water/adequate heat and have not heard anything from them. I have emailed, dropped off a letter, messaged through the portal and called and left a message. Not sure what else to do.",

They continue to add on new charges to nickel and dime renters whenever they feel like it and consistently raise rent without any improvements to the apartment or a real reason other than the market. They send a pay up or get out eviction notice after being late one time on payment over the course of multiple years of residence over a simple clerical error with no contact follow up or phone call to perhaps check on why rent was late. Ive lived at one of their rentals for almost three years and this is kind of treatment Ive received. They do not care about residents. I wish I had not resigned my lease and looked elsewhere.

About 2 square feet per room smaller. The washing machines went out for a week, and they did nothing to respond to our calls and emails, so we just had to wear dirty clothes. They didnt charge us for electricity until this month, when they dropped the 2 months of electricity bills on us at once, AFTER our rent had already been paid, then continued to charge us $5 per day of late fees without notifying us. We didnt notice this until it racked up to over $50. Then, of course, theyve continued to not respond to our emails or calls, and continually go out of office for extended periods of time. They are raising the rent, and making us sign the lease for next year in December. If we dont by the 8th, they are going to raise it again. If we don't by the end of the month, they will assume we arent renewing?? PTLA is an awful, selfish, money hungry business. Never trust them.",

I had days where I called up to 6 times with no response or reply to voicemail or email. The property manager where I lived also rarely answered or returned calls.\n2. My unit was brand new when we started the rental.  The unit was covered in construction dust and had clearly not been cleaned.  We even found a doorstop in the freezer.\n3.  PTLA billed me for over 4 hours of cleaning (in addition to the carpet cleaning I had agreed to in the lease).  I sent PTLA multiple pictures of the clean apartment asking what the fee was for and noting that PTLA postmarked my refund over the time allowed by law.  PTLA then refunded the remainder of my deposit.\n\nIf renting with PTLA, I suggest documenting everything very thoroughly.  Take excessive photos, videos and follow up on phone calls via email.\n\nAlso, note that the reviews now only show as going back to Summer of 2023.  The old reviews are now missing.",

The parking at this property is atrocious and after moving in, they decided to change our assigned parking spot to one that doesnt even fit our stock F150. After three months of being told they will work to find us a new spot, they now refuse to help. The on site garbage bin areas are filled with trash daily and trash all over the ground.

I have had to deal with them at two separate properties and they have been difficult the entire time.\nBelvedere - they used the age of the building to excuse poor maintenance. There was mold, fleas, the windows leaked, the basement flooded multiple times, washers backed up with black fluid, and there were three seperate gas leaks when I moved out. Maintenance requests were slow and as soon as you asked for something more than the bare minimum they stopped responding.\nElwood edge - when owership transferred PTLA lost my rent payments and proof of insurance and then tried to EVICT ME. This was after I notified them of the fact that a payment wasn't applied to my account. They stopped responding to my calls and emails after the eviction notice without notifying me that they had stopped proceeding with the eviction.\n\nPlease stay away from them!

The unit I was put into first smelled like the person renting it BATHED in w3ed, despite the lease clearly stating that ANY drug--and literally calling out this one!--is a violation of the lease and cause for revocation of your security deposit. It took a new company coming in, 10 weeks after my \"allowed\" unit change date before I finally got into another unit - and I was still paying for the druggie den! Thankfully the new company acknowledged that PTLA is full of lazy @$$h0les and waived the $250 fee that PTLA no doubt would have charged me for the 10 weeks they spent not replying to my request to move. WORST. COMPANY. E V E R. Also, be SUPER suspicious: there used to be reviews dating from back to 2014 here that averaged to 1.2. ~ mysteriously~, they are all gone.

According to certain user reviews, some tenants have praised specific employees, like Julian and Jeremy, for their understanding nature and diligence, which contributed to smoother rental processes.
