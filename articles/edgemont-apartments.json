The new managers are amazing and there are even little events they host to try to get to know everyone. The management know me by name. They are really fixing up the place!",

        "review": "Apex is now PTLA and ever since they bought this property it has been grossly mismanaged. The beautiful trees that made living here bareable were butchered last year or cut down altogether. There is constantly barking dogs despite complaints and trash everywhere. This used to be a well maintained property with an on site manager, but now I'm lucky if I get a response through email or maintenance tickets. I never wanted to live where Apex owned, now my family has to move again. There is so much more to write....",

          "text": "As of last week, the property is now managed by Gather Property Management, and we are really looking forward to addressing the things you mentioned, so that Edgemont is a place you are happy to call home. We have opened the on-site leasing office, so we will be regularly available to you. The property has such a lovely setting, and the floor plans of the apartments are so spacious. We are immediately focusing on things like keeping up the garbage areas daily, tending to the pet waste stations, and making sure that your maintenance requests are handled timely. The new fitness center will be opening soon, and there will be more amenities to come for our residents at no additional cost. If you have any other suggestions or concerns, please bring them to us in the office. We look forward to getting to know you!"

        "review": "Don't rent here unless you want to live in a place that goes neglected.  PTLA took over mgmt of this property in Feb and they are running the place down. It is the middle of June and they have not sent anyone out to maintain the lawn. The grass is taller than my dog and in some places it is taller than my son who is 5'10\".\n\nTrash is a problem here too. I have seen trash that has been laying around since November. PTLA is aware of the problem because myself and others call weekly but they refuse to do anything about it. We are also supposed to have an on-site property manager and yet we have not had one in 5 mos. The office should send someone once a week to deal with issues here. Lawn maintenance, trash pickup, and on-site manager are things that are supposed to be included in our rent. These things have been neglected and yet we are still paying the same amount of money.",

        "review": "DO NOT RENT!!!!! First off, this company refuses to do any communication by email so they have no paper trail of any of their promises or issues. Red flag. Secondly, they will not tell you that half of the buildings back up to a large industrial site that starts it machinery at 6 am every day, even weekends. Lastly, when we tried to break our lease during the pandemic due to needing to financially help family, we spoke to Rea, the property manager (we emailed her first to get this in writing, but the only way she would actually talk to us was on the phone) and she told us we would need to forfeit our deposit, which we expected and were ok with, but also pay a $375 cleaning fee, which we decided was ok as well.   A few days later, the new maintenance man cornered me alone in the mail room (I am a 24 year old woman) and told me he knew what apartment I was in and interrogated me about the state of the carpets as he would be moving into that unit when we vacated. This was a scary and unsettling experience.\nOnce we finally moved out, we got a call stating that we needed to pay the next month's rent as they could not get the carpets cleaned in time to rent it. We had given ample notice and agreed to the initial fees.\nThese were not new carpets and it was their employee moving into this unit, not a tenant. They knew we would not be able to take them to court or fight this so we did just have to eat the charge as they were threatening us with collections. They took advantage of a young couple during a global pandemic and grossly extorted us for money they had verbally promised us was not expected. Not worth the hassle for overpriced, shoddily built apartments.",

Ra (the property manager) and Jordan (in charge of maintenance) are always very communicative and helpful. If I ever have an issue with something they are very responsive and attentive.
