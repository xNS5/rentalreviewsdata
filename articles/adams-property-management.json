Problems generally get fixed quickly, and they'll be a respectful and attentive landlord as long as you're an attentive tenant.\n\nThey have a reputation for being strict, but I've always been a respectful tenant, and am treated with the same respect.\n\nThey've never played games with nickel-and-diming security deposits, something many other landlords in Bellingham seem to love to do.",

Truthfully Adams is the second worst (Lakeway wins first by a landslide- oi vey). This guy...I've never been so abused by a property management company. Know your renters rights, people! DO NOT let Howard Adams bully you!",

        "review": "Absolutely disgusting and disgraceful excuse for a Property Management company.\n\nMy roommates and I were in love with our duplex we were renting from Adams, until we noticed a few of the appliances (along with the already-damaged carpets and floors that needed maintenance in terms of cleaning) needed attention. Since Adams is... SHOCKER... supposed to facilitate maintenance on up-keeping the house, we have made arrangements for some of these things to be fixed on numerous occasions (and arrangements were NOT made easily by any measure - we always had to be the ones calling the repair people [which i'm pretty sure is not standard procedure]). Finally, one day when my roommate decided to take the rent check in, she inquired about the possibility of having the carpets taken care of, since we had been ignore several times on this request. Without hesitation, the owner (Howard) flipped out on my roommate and spewed the most distasteful sexist garbage onto her, claiming she was a \"bitch\" and threatened eviction on us for no good reason whatsoever, other than the fact that we were \"annoying\" and he \"hated our unit\". (All VERBATIM from what was said) Long story short, APM will not be going down without a fight. Absolutely the worst rental company experience ever.",

        "review": "Renting with Adam's for six years was one of the worst decisions of my life. The homes are not clean -- we moved into a house filled with garbage, food that was YEARS old, and damage -- and ended up having to pay for the previous tenants damage. Howard and the other woman in charge do not have any idea of how to run a business. They are aggressive, disorganized, unprofessional and downright ridiculous. Howard will come to your house unannounced and be rude. Yes, he will just walk in. I wish I was kidding. Don't expect to ever get a call back unless  they didn't get their money. Howard is incredibly aggressive towards women and will cuss at you over the phone or in person. The office is dirty and covered with papers. I have no idea how they get anything done because when they arent being incredibly rude they are so out of it it's comical. Without a doubt the worst experience i've ever had.",
