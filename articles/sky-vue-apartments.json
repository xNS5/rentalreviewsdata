        "review": "Avoid.\n\nMy experience with management here has been disappointing.\nDefinitely the most anti-tenant environment Ive encountered.  They respond to any inquiry with aggressively trying to get you to sign another lease.\n\nThey are quick to tow, do so often (I witnessed at least ten vehicles being towed), and often threaten to do so. I have never lived in another complex where towing was an issue.  There were several instances, such as during parking lot repairs when they ordered the entire lot to be cleared, warning that any remaining vehicles would be towed.\n\nDuring my two years here, I witnessed three separate incidents where falling trees caused significant damage to vehicles (two of which are pictured). Despite these occurrences, management has, to date, failed to address the dangerous trees effectively, of which there are still many.\n\nSpeaking of the parking lot, halfway through my time there, management arbitrarily began charging tenants $25/mo. just to park in the lot, when it had been free with the lease in years prior.  (and yep, you guessed it, they tow anyone not paying).\n\nThe units and buildings themselves are consistently dirty, no matter how much effort you put in. The carpets and kitchen flooring are stained and discolored, and theres a persistent unpleasant odor throughout the complex.  Appliances are old and outdated and will likely give you issues.\n\nI wouldnt live here again for the price I was originally paying, let alone the price increase they changed during my stay. You can find a better place.",

        "review": "They did not honor their $250 rent concession for September that was offered to tenants who renewed their lease. Then had the nerve to charge late fees on that $250 because they were negligent in crediting it on time. Impossible to get it straightened out with them, despite the rent concession being in writing and management confirming in email that I will be getting it for September rent. Hard to get a hold of, and they keep saying they will fix it but don't. This is how they treat good tenants. Beware.",

        "review": "Sky Vue has basically terrible customer service in the Leasing Office, for a week and a half we were without hot water and working electricity and they ignored the entire buildings communications to them for a week until saying they would fix the problem the following Friday (then didnt actually fix it until the following Tuesday). The maintenance team enters your home without notice (theyve walked in on me undressed). The building itself is falling apart, with constant need for maintenance in the apartments and the side panel of the building recently just fell off? Also saw some reviews stating it was clean The stairways are notoriously smelly and dirty with spills and dirt. Not worth it for the price.",

The reason the repair took so long was because PSE (Puget Sound Energy) was the one who had to make the repair and they got to the community as quickly as they were able. Our team tried to accommodate as best as possible, offering alternative showering locations, Door Dash giftcards, and also a rent credit. I'm sorry that these efforts for a repair that was out of our hands were not to your satisfaction. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you in greater detail regarding your concerns.

        "review": "Here goes nothing: My roomates and I did a lease takeover with Landmark at the beginning of the year. That process was hell but at least we were able to get a decent place in Bellingham at an affordable price when split between the 3 of us. We were able to have our pets with no issues and maintenance requests were slow but at least processed. We get news in April that Pacific properties and WWU living are taking over management and that our apt will be rented out by room at a ridiculously high rent. Approximately 750 for a mini master and then appox. 740 for a single room plus 30 per person for water. The unit was originally 1050 total and included most utilities. Im sorry I have never in my life paid more that 30 for 3 months worth of water services so 90 a month is a scam. The property is right next to the I5 on ramp so if your unit faces west, youre going to have interrupted sleep like no other, also the appliances and entire building is outdated. I know WWU has said they are upgrading the units however new office style carpeting in the halls and a lurid paint scheme dont justify the obscene rent hike.\nAnother change implemented is no double occupancy so even if the price hike wasnt enough to make you go insane my roommates and I wouldnt have been able to stay as they were a couple renting the mini master room.\nAs mentioned by others WWU Living communication leaves something to be majorly desired. Their emails arent clear and are often sent out WHILE the project is happening. This occurred while they were cleaning balconies and painting the exterior of the property. The great mailbox vandalism of 2019 may not have been their fault directly, but they could have communicated sooner that our mail was going to be rerouted to an offsite location and kept us updated. It is their job to contact the appropriate outlet and relay the info to the tenants.\nThere are only 10 reviews including mine but the mass exodus of units over the past 3 months should speak for itself.",

        "review": "The management here is horrible.   My daughter rents an apartment here and they almost never give notice before entering her apartment.  Her first roommate was brought in to view the apartment without notice and while my daughter was sleeping.  Her roommate later told her that whoever was giving the tour said they knew she was in there and that they really werent supposed be doing this.  Today they entered again while she was at work And left all the lights on so she knew they were there while she was gone.  While I was talking to her in the phone she told me that the maintenance guy just came in again, unannounced, with no warning, and not even a knock on the door.  She peeked out of her bedroom door and saw him and he wasnt even wearing a mask.  She is terrified to leave her room now.   I called the management and of course I get no answer, I just left a voicemail.  I feel like they take advantage of young college kids and think they can get away with this kind of thing.  Steer clear of here if you want any privacy.",

        "review": "EDIT: I posted this review a few months ago and I wanted to update with things that have happened since then. My lease ended on August 9th, but we had to deal with several more problems from property management. Despite the fact that our lease ended in August, we were still charged for September rent in our online portal. My roommate had to call several times to even get an answer, and was simply told \"oh that happens sometimes, but you don't have to pay it\". I then emailed them about the issue through the online portal because I wanted that in writing, and I received no response. Finally, after several weeks, the charge was removed, but not after quite a lot of complaining on our part, and if we hadn't said anything, I'm sure we would have been expected to pay. As other reviews have stated, our mailbox was broken a couple months back and we were not notified for a week. A whole week went by where our mail wasn't being delivered and we were not told. It also took over a month to fix, which may or may not have been their fault, but communication was lacking either way. Additionally, while this didn't happen to me personally as we cancelled our internet before this, I've heard from several other residents that they couldn't cancel their internet plans before moving out because, with no notification, Pacific Living Properties merged all tenants accounts into one controlled by them, so tenants didn't have control over them. Again, this was done completely behind their backs and I'm not even sure how it's possible, but it happened. Right now we're just waiting on our security deposit (which we were told we'd receive within 3 weeks of our lease ending, but I'm honestly skeptical) so we can finally be done with this place for good. Absolutely do not rent from Pacific Living Properties, WWU Living, or Sky Vue if at all possible, despite the fact that they're now so desperate for tenants they're offering discounts to current residents to entice them to stay, and continually extending the deadline for lease renewals in the hope of getting more people. It's not working, and it isn't worth it.\n\nIf you're looking for an apartment in Bellingham, look elsewhere. I've lived here for two years and it's decent, but it was recently bought by a new property management company, Pacific Living Properties, and is absolutely no longer worth it. They've increased the rent on my 3 bedroom apartment by almost $700 (from about $1500 to almost $2200) for the next leasing period. The amenities advertised in their listings are exaggerated at best and a straight up lie at worst. They advertise a community game area and a resident center with free printing, for example, but neither of those are actually on site, they're at other apartment communities managed by PLP. I've already had more issues with this company in the month they've managed the property than I had in two years with the previous owners. Again, the apartments are in alright shape, but are absolutely not worth the $700+ per person you'd be paying for them. You can do a lot better for a lot cheaper, so save your time and money.",

        "review": "bear with me, this will be long,\n\nWhen this building was owned by Landmark it was fine, low prices (I paid $550 for a 3 bedroom with 2 closets & a private half bath) made the outdated interior, rough around the edges aspects of this place alright. Since it was purchased by Pacific Living (WWU living) its genuinely a scam. Prices for the 3 bedrooms went up $300 a person. For no reason. Literally no reason at all. Currently I am sitting in my third floor bedroom as my entire room shakes & my ceiling crumbles in my bathroom due to my ceiling fan being physically hammered out of my ceiling due to unnecessary re-roofing. They have been unbearably banging, yelling, dropping heavy wheelbarrows etc since 7am. Besides the current situation I am in they promised updates to make the costs worth it. this included paint (ugly paint at that) fixing a roof that nobody felt needed fixing or complained about, pressure washing the entire building which ended in water leaking in from all windows & doors because of how poor the structure of this building is & promises of covered parking (doesnt exist) & other useless cosmetic features nobody asked for. I have to run my dryer 3 times to get my clothes dry, the microwave doesnt open all the way & makes a super loud scary noise when used, weve had our freezer, fridge, sink, dishwasher, & mold on our ceiling fixed & weve been here for less than a year. Theyve been doing updates for the past month & have offered no accommodation or apologies for how unbearably inconvenient it is for their tenants. Nobody is renewing their lease that I know of and theres an entire facebook page where people posts complaints & even are considering legal action against this company. The WWU Off Housing department is NOT ASSOCIATED with this company in any way & have sent complaints & attempted legal action against Pacific Living for using WWU as a marketing scam. They are genuinely trying to scam college kids. The images online dont look like the actual apartments, their promises are empty & I cannot wait to move out. They are attempting to force everyone to sign a document that has agreements not within our personal lease so that they can charge us $200 if our apartment isnt clean enough when they do tours. They are trying to change our lease agreement in the middle of our lease. Do not move in here, do not pay the ridiculous rent, do not believe this company when they say anything. People who have lived here for 5+ years are moving out. Adults live here & are moving out. Everyones moving out. Find another place to live, trust me.",

Although we understand the increase can seem high, we would also like to thank you for recognizing that we are following through with the updates. Renewals are receiving upgrades in the apartment such as new fixtures, hardware, and new flooring in the kitchen/bathroom. We will also be painting the outside of the building, re-landscaping the property, updating the lighting in the hallways as well as painting the walls.\nWe recognize that student housing is not for everyone and that all current resident are not a student however we do manage 4 other properties nearby that are all rent by the room options. This model benefits the residents to only be responsible for their room rent and not an entire unit.

        "review": "I'd give 0 stars if possible. It's a college town so there's not going to be much, if any, great property managements. However stay away from this one, seriously, it's the worst one I've ever dealt with. If I would've known Landmark was selling I wouldn't of wasted my time moving in just to be basically forced to move out a few months later. They increased the rent by over 50%, utilities aren't included anymore. The barbecue place they talk about is a drive away, not on location. Also their pictures are inaccurate. There is one specific picture with bar stools, the bar top can barely hold something the size of a candle. I moved into a 2 bedroom, 1.5 bath. The master has 2 closets and a half bath and its huge. The 2nd room is probably half the size, 1 closet, and has to share a bathroom but Pacific Living is charging only $10 less for the 2nd bedroom. I've also been told that you are not allowed to share a bedroom with anyone. And they rent out by the room, I'm not a Western student, I don't want some random person living with me. The parking is awful. You get 2 parking passes, even for the 3 bedroom, and there is never enough parking. No guest parking, and they hand out parking tickets often. The management is the absolute worse at communicating, for instance we stopped receiving mail due to mailbox damage and was never informed our mail was being directed off site. The location is awful anyway, I wake up constantly due to the freeway. Oh and the fire alarm goes off often, so the whole building has to evacuate. I could go on but moral of the story: they only care about taking all of your money. You can find somewhere much better for cheaper. I enjoyed living in Son Rise properties.\n\nThey have also been doing remodeling but not informing the residents of when things are getting done. For example, when they did the hallway floors we had no notice and we were stuck in our apartment for hours. Thankfully, I lived on the bottom level so I just jumped my balcony so I could get to work on time. I don't know what everyone else did on the upper levels.\n\nBy the way, it's super sketchy you won't even allow us to be there for the final walk through. It's not our fault everyone is moving out due to the rent hike. Also, how do you not have corporates phone number? I need to speak to someone higher up then WWU living since you aren't willing to help me. You put me on hold for 7 minutes just to tell me you can't find the phone number.",

At that time we responded with the following: \"Hi Mahkayla, Thank you for taking the time to reach out and leave a review. We are sorry to hear you are as displeased with the community as every interaction. with you has been a positive one. In regards to the price increase, apartments are receiving upgrades such as new fixtures, hardware, and new flooring in the kitchen/bathroom. We have also painted the outside of the building, are in the process of re-landscaping the property, changed the flooring and painted the interior hallways. We recognize that student housing is not for everyone and that all current residents are not a student however we do manage 4 other properties nearby that are all rent by the room options. This model benefits the residents to only be responsible for their room rent and not an entire unit. We understand that parking can be difficult at times but to ensure that everyone does have at least one available space we do have to limit the amount of parking spaces that are given out. Tickets are distributed through our parking lot monitor to any car that does not display a permit in their window and/or is parked incorrectly in the lot. It looks like your move out date is coming up but we are happy to provide you with an additional permit to ensure this doesnt continue to happen. The mailboxes were vandalized and we replaced the part that was our responsibility within a week and a half (mostly due to shipping). Unfortunately the Post Office took more time to replace the panel with the lock. They are the only ones that can have the key so our hands were tied but we did follow up each week and every time we received an update we would send one out to the residents. After looking through the emails that were sent it does look like the address of where the mail was being held was at the bottom of each one. We are happy to discuss any areas of improvement that you feel the management could have done better. Please feel free to reach out to skyvue@plpinc.net or if you would like to set up a time to meet at the leasing office we are happy to do that as well. We appreciate your residency and hope to hear from you soon.\". Please reach out to us directly if there is anything further we can do for you."

        "review": "Theres something to be said about any place immediately going up by 50% over market price  with new owners. And a fresh coat of paint isnt fooling anyone. PLP are profiteers and they are disrespectful of existing tenants who still have leases through Landmark. Maintenance requests and other help is being ignored or handled with minimal effort.\nMost notably they are charging THE SAME rent for units with two VASTLY different sized rooms. These apartments originally considered the second bed in our unit as a master bedroom. It has its own bathroom. Under PLP, its now going to be charged the same as the smaller bedroom at HALF the size - seven hundred fifty dollars. Each. The new leases have far stricter rules than necessary as well.\nThe website literally lists features that this apartment does not have. The mailbox was broken into recently, and at last look its been a week with no signs of the issue being addressed. So were not getting mail now and unsure whether or not its getting regularly stolen. I reported it myself and was met with a rude yeah were aware and no further information.\nParking here sucks, and theres no indication that they will address the issue, despite the (and I cannot stress this enough) 50% increase in rent over market price. Prepare to go looking for street parking at night or occasional parking tickets.\nEven if you can afford this place, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite the overwhelmingly negative reviews, one positive remark did highlight some improvements at Sky Vue Apartments. A tenant noted a shift in management that brought about better communication and maintained a standard of professionalism. They appreciated that maintenance requests were handled promptly, shedding light on some positive aspects of their experience. This feedback suggests that some tenants have found the current management to be more accommodating than past administrations. Another point mentioned was that the management has been more open to approving applications for individuals in need, and some tenants found the condition of the units to be decent. While exceptions, these comments provide a glimmer of hope for potential tenants who might consider the complex.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>This section of the article highlights the scattered positive feedback. While rare, a review did mention a decent living experience at Sky Vue Apartments, emphasizing that new management had increased communication levels. This suggests efforts have been made to address previous communication issues. Furthermore, some tenants felt that management's approval process for renters in need was commendable. Although not common, these snippets of feedback imply that there are segments of residents who find the service and living experience acceptable, if not commendable, under certain circumstances. The mention of affordable rent before recent hikes also brings a favorable point to light, where pricing was once considered competitive.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Several user reviews expressed dissatisfaction with management and their handling of the property. Issues like late reimbursements for promised concessions were common complaints, with tenants noting difficulties in communication and getting matters rectified. A significant number of reviews also mentioned excessive noise due to ongoing, unexplained construction, which caused considerable inconvenience. Moreover, some reviews critiqued the outdated appliances and ineffective maintenance that seemed to ignore smaller but crucial living standards. Tenants felt trapped by the structural disrepair and sudden hikes in rent with minimal upgrades to justify them.</p><p>Lack of transparency was a common theme, with instances of mailbox break-ins going unreported to residents, leaving them without mail for extended periods. Moreover, arbitrary price hikes pushed rent beyond affordable limits for many, deterring potential renewals. On several occasions, the reviews criticized management for ignoring the underlying problems, focusing on cosmetic changes to increase rent. Residents particularly resented the charges for utilities that were previously included, leading to a consensus that the apartments no longer provided value for money.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most concerning issues with Sky Vue Apartments stem from alleged unethical management practices. Many tenants reported unauthorized entries into their apartments, which understandably breached their sense of privacy and security. Stories circulated about management bringing prospective tenants without notice, contributing to a feeling of vulnerability among current residents. Adding to the severity, parking vehicles have been reportedly towed without prior warnings, inciting a feeling of constant surveillance and unease. Multiple tenants recounted severe structural issues, such as falling trees damaging vehicles or mailboxes being tampered with, which management reportedly took too long to address, further exacerbating tenant frustrations.</p><p>Compounded by reportedly astronomical rent hikes of up to 50%, many stated that moving out was their only recourse. There is mention of poorly managed transition phases with different management companies causing confusion about lease terms and tenant rights. The prevalent sentiment is one of distrust, as numerous tenants expressed fears of being scammed or neglected by higher-ups within the management hierarchy. These egregious reports highlight a severely tarnished reputation, leading many current residents to strongly advise against moving in.</p></section>"
