        "review": "If you love silverfish you should live here!! I lived in Sandpiper (unit 211) and it was infested with silverfish all year. I started noticing them 3 months into moving in. Because Im scared of bugs, I mostly stayed in my partners apartment so I was rarely at my own. Still, with the dehumidifier running almost every day & barely using the bathroom to prevent moisture, they were everywhere. The apartment helped me by calling Pest Control and so around 75% of the silverfish I would find were already dead. But its gross. The whole building is infested, my friend who moved into a unit above mine recently found some in her bathroom as well. Other than that, Im giving it 2 stars for being modern, affordable, and downtown accessible housing. I loved everything else about living here except the Silverfish & my upstairs gaming neighbor who would scream and bang on his desk until 4am every night :)",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>The Sandpiper has several positive aspects, primarily appreciated by tenants for its modern amenities. Residents have highlighted that the property is affordable and conveniently located in downtown Bellingham, which adds to its appeal for those who prioritize accessibility. Its placement makes it ideal for those who enjoy the convenience of urban living, being close to stores, restaurants, and public transport. Another point of praise is the overall modern feel of the apartments, which is often sought after by renters looking for a fresh and updated living space.</p><p>Moreover, the property management at The Sandpiper has shown responsiveness in some instances, as noted by a reviewer who described the service as \"really responsive\" and \"great.\" This indicates a willingness by the management to address tenant needs promptly, at least some of the time. Such responsiveness is crucial in maintaining tenant satisfaction, and even a single review valuing this aspect suggests there are times when management exceeds expectations in meeting resident concerns.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>In regard to great aspects, The Sandpiper gains commendation particularly for its advantageous location and affordability. Being situated in downtown Bellingham ensures that residents can access a plethora of services, entertainment, and dining options without the hassle of long commutes, significantly enhancing the living experience. The affordability of the units, combined with their modern design, makes the apartments attractive to a range of budget-conscious renters who do not wish to compromise on style or convenience.</p><p>Completion of maintenance tasks is handled efficiently, as indicated by a user's brief but positive feedback about the responsive management. This suggests that, at its best, the management team is attentive and dedicated to creating a positive living environment. Although review details are limited, it seems when the property's team is responsive, it leaves a lasting impression on tenants.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>However, there are notable issues at The Sandpiper, as indicated by one tenant's experience with a significant silverfish infestation problem. The resident of unit 211 described encountering silverfish throughout the year, even after efforts to manage humidity levels and minimize moisture in the apartment. Despite management calling pest control, the issue remained pervasive, causing discomfort and inconveniences for the tenant who resorted to spending time elsewhere to avoid the pests.</p><p>Noise disturbances are another complaint, with a specific mention of an upstairs neighbor causing disruptions during late hours. Persistent noise issues, such as gaming-related disturbances lasting until 4 am, illustrate an environment where management might need to better address tenant concerns related to noise control to ensure a more peaceful living situation for all residents.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most concerning aspect of The Sandpiper is the severe silverfish infestation that, according to user reviews, affects not just one unit but potentially the entire building. This issue was so severe that it overshadowed the other positives of living in the apartment. The overwhelming presence of pests to the point where they are seen dead even after pest control efforts exemplifies a failure in adequately managing such critical issues. The lack of a public response from the management to address this feedback on the review platform also raises concerns about accountability and commitment to improving tenant living conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, the absence of any management responses to the reviews suggests a lack of engagement with tenant feedback, which might otherwise help in resolving ongoing issues or providing assurance to current and potential residents. Such disengagement can negatively affect the property's reputation and might deter prospective tenants who prioritize transparency and active communication with property management.</p></section>"
