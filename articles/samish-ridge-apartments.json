        "review": "I have lived here for five and a half years.  Snow season means shovels and ice melt at every entrance.  The slopping drive way is shoveled as much as possible. Truely the management cares.  Mowed during the summer and pet friendly.  K & M live on site and hire tenants to work on projects.  It is my favorite place (don't move much) in the last 23 years.  Not a slum at all.  Storage may be available on-site. Quiet too.",

        "review": "I really enjoy living here. The apartments are spacious and nice. The People that run it are really awesome and friendly, and they can fix most things, so you don't have to wait forever for a service appointment! There is plenty of parking, and their pet policy is very reasonable. There is a nice clubhouse(pool and ping pong table) and workout room. The only thing that could make this place better is a bike rack.",

        "review": "I've lived in 4 of these apartments over the last 6.5 years and I have nothing but wonderful things to say. The apartment's themselves are big and very pet friendly. The apartment manager Karen is one of the best people I know and treats every tenant as if they were family- she has done so much for me over the years. I feel like these apartments are truly home.",

        "review": "Best apartment I've ever lived in. Excellent value, mucho convenient, especially if you're a Western student because it's right next to the park and ride so you'll always have a spot on the bus. Pet friendly! Mel and the whole team are awesome, even Canada Man-- all friendly, responsive, and helpful. Be sure to apply soon soon soon because it's so great they rarely have vacancy. Small drawbacks: freeway noise and the ceilings/floors are a little thin so don't apply if you're a partier.",

Not only that, but their pet policy is fantastic!  I can happily have all three of my cats with no problem and the deposit was very reasonable.  This has been my favorite complex to rent at ever!",

        "review": "Samish Ridge is hands down the best apartment complex I've ever lived at and by far the best in Bellingham! Leann and Kari are the greatest. Unfortunately we graduated and my fiance was offered a job opportunity back at home so we moved. We have had a hard time finding a place down at home that compares. This complex was pet friendly, the apartments are very clean, well maintained, spacious and affordable. The staff is beyond great, they're always available to talk to, the property grounds are well kept, quiet, and safe. We never once had an issue with our place and the only time we had a small maintenance request, it was handled within the hour. We also miss their workout area and club house. They have pool table, bowflex, three cardio machines and a sauna. Rarely did it ever get busy enough to wait for anything either.\n\nThe location is great, it's not too far from the University and in a great neighborhood where you're close enough to the city, but partying and noise had never been an issue. The complex is comprised of a pretty even mix of students and  working professionals. You're just about a 10 minute walk to Fred Meyer or to Haggen and the park 'n ride is right across the street, so you have plenty of options. This place is rarely vacant, as we were on a waiting list and referred by some friends before first living here. So take a look and if they have a vacancy, take it! You'll thank me later! :)",

        "review": "I previously lived here for about 2.5 years. I have lived several places since but this is absolutely the best apartment complex I have lived in to date. \n\nThe first thing is the management. Leann and Kari are awesome, awesome managers. Nice and friendly and respond to maintenance requests in record time. I never realized just how spoiled I was until I moved away.\n\nLocation, location, location. Super quiet complex away from the main campus student rentals. I lived here when I was attending WWU and it was great because it was literally a five minute walk to the park and ride. After I was out of school it was nice because it was super easy to get on the freeway to go to work - 1 minute drive to go north on I-5, less than 5 minutes to go south.\n\nThe apartments themselves are spacious and a great value for the price. I lived in both a two bedroom and a one bedroom and they were both huge! The one bedroom had the largest closet I have ever seen in an apartment, ever. The cabinets/carpet/flooring are all standard apartment fare, nothing special but really well maintained. Washer, dryer, dishwasher included. There's an exercise room in the main building and you can reserve common area in the main building for events.",

        "review": "If you're going to live in Bellingham, live at Samish Ridge. I cannot say enough good things about it.\n\nWe lived here for four years and they were wonderful. First off, the location is awesome. It's close to Haggen, Fred Meyer, Rite Aid, El Agave, Boomer's, and it's right next to the Park N Ride so it is beyond easy (and a short bus ride) to everywhere on Bill McDonald Pkwy and the WWU campus. We rarely used our car because Bellingham public transit is so great and Samish Ridge is right next to the Park N Ride.\n\nThe apartments themselves are clean and spacious. There is a fitness room that I used countless times, the area is beautiful for going on walks, and the manager is wonderful. Her name is Melanie, and she is incredibly kind and personable and responds to maintenance requests and questions very fast. \n\nThe complex is quiet - not a party zone for students like Indian St., and the rent is fair. Pets allowed AND washer/dryer in unit. Again, I can't say enough good things. The staff, the location, the apartments themselves - everything was superb. We loved living here and were sad to move out of the area.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>This article highlights some positive aspects of living at Samish Ridge Apartments.

User reviews underscore the property management's flexibility and understanding when it comes to pet ownership, with one tenant happily keeping multiple cats without issues. The property also provides ample parking and features such as a clubhouse and gym that residents find beneficial, creating a well-rounded living environment. The presence of quiet surroundings and a peaceful community further contribute to a positive living experience at Samish Ridge Apartments.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>In this article, the great aspects of Samish Ridge Apartments center around exemplary property management. Multiple user reviews commend the management team for their exceptional responsiveness and friendliness. Tenants feel like they are treated as family, and maintenance requests are handled swiftly, often within the hour. The sense of community fostered by the management team adds to the overall appeal, with residents noting the managers' personal touch in everyday operations.</p><p>Another great feature frequently highlighted in user reviews is the strategic location of the apartments. Proximity to the Western Washington University and the park and ride makes it convenient for both students and working professionals. This contributes to the high demand and low vacancy rates, as new tenants often find themselves on a waiting list. The apartments' location also allows residents to enjoy a peaceful atmosphere without being too far from the city's hustle, striking a perfect balance for urban living.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Although user reviews of Samish Ridge Apartments are overwhelmingly positive, this article addresses some minor drawbacks that tenants have experienced. One such issue is the noise from the nearby freeway, which some residents found disruptive, especially if they prefer a quieter living environment. The complaint suggests that those sensitive to noise may need to consider this factor before moving in.</p><p>Another point mentioned in user reviews is the thinness of the floors and ceilings, which can be a concern for those sensitive to hearing footsteps or activity from neighbors. However, these issues seem to be dealt with minorly and do not overshadow the generally positive experience at Samish Ridge. Residents looking for a vibrant party lifestyle may also find the area too quiet, indicating it's more suited for those seeking a tranquil living environment.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>There are no significant grievances or ugly experiences reported by tenants at Samish Ridge Apartments, as user reviews tend to reflect overwhelmingly positive sentiments. This article has found no evidence of major issues such as neglect of property management duties, unreturned security deposits, or poor communication that typically mar a tenant's experience. The fact that management has not responded to the user reviews could suggest that they choose to directly address tenants' concerns rather than in public forums, or that the reviews themselves were adequately reflective of the tenants' contentment.</p></section>"
