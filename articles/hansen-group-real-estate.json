        "review": "Jon and Ashleigh are highly responsive, patient and brutally honest with you during your home buying experience. I have purchased three homes and sold one. They gave me the best experience that I've ever had in real estate. They showed me house after house after house, all the while continuously narrowing the search to exactly what I wanted. I felt well represented, even before Jon knew that I was approved. Jon's knowledge of Whatcom county was invaluable as a newcomer to this part of the country. I can't say enough good things about this team!",

That, along with world-class negotiating skills make him an ideal agent to have in your corner. He's been very attentive to our needs and desires, even recommending we not pursue properties that didn't line up. Highly recommend Jon and his team! He will help you accomplish your goals.",

        "review": "Jon and his team did a tremendous job selling my father's home.  My father and mother had relished living in their Victorian house for decades.  It was a difficult decision to sell the home.  Jon and Cody understood the meaning of the home to my father.  They \"got\" the feeling and architecture of the house.  When faced with a challenge Jon continued his work with a practical and positive approach.  His team (thanks Katie!) were supportive, prompt and detail oriented.  If you are considering selling your home you will be well served by Jon.  Can't say enough.  Thanks Jon, Katie and Cody!\n\nSheila LaRose",

        "review": "We worked with Jon and Ashleigh after we felt pressured to purchase a horrible fixer-upper by a previous realtor. With the market being so competitive, we were wary that we were going to be pushed again to put down an offer on a home that didnt meet all our expectations. That was far from what happened. Jon and Ashleigh walked through the buying process at our pace. Our journey took a year, and throughout that time, we felt nothing but support and encouragement. They validated or concerns, presented different options, and put us in the drivers seat. Once we found the perfect home, Ashleighs drive and expertise helped us get the winning bid. We couldnt be happier with our new home and neighborhood!",

        "review": "I am choosing 2 stars for my interaction with Jon Hanson, because really it was Meh.  And I have experienced better.  Jon was not our agent, but rather called on a property we were listing.  He called my line to schedule a viewing of the house for his clients and treated me like his personal secretary requesting I take a message for him for our listing agent.  When I let him know he would be better to call the agent directly he insisted I take a message.  Honestly I was not impressed and when it came time to review offers not only did he have his clients on an obscene escalation, which wasted money, but I found that his general attitude was not helpful to his clients in making the winning bid. When faced with two very similar bids do you pick the offer tinged with arrogance or the other?  The choice was clear for us.\n\nIn a sellers market I would advice that you look for an agent that will not only work hard for you, but also show that they can negotiate and engage with prospective sellers respectfully. I would hate to see a family miss out on the home of their dreams over agent communication issues.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>This section highlights the positive feedback received by Hansen Group Real Estate in user reviews. Many customers have praised the knowledge and resourcefulness of Jon and his team. One client noted that Jon's vast experience and market insights made conversations particularly beneficial, underscoring the team's ability to provide helpful advice and guidance. Additionally, there have been multiple mentions of team members being supportive and detail-oriented, traits that are highly valued in the industry. The team's commitment to their clients' needs is evident in how they handle the buying and selling process; for instance, a reviewer appreciated how Jon and Ashleigh took the pressure off during home selection by focusing on the clients' best interests. This client-centric approach has earned the team high marks from satisfied customers.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The Hansen Group Real Estate has garnered accolades for exceptional service, often going above and beyond normal expectations. A frequent theme in the user reviews includes instances where team members made the process of buying or selling homes smooth and stress-free. Clients have reported successful transactions, noting the team's world-class negotiation skills and dedication. For instance, Patrick shared how Jon resolved issues without hesitation, even months after closing, which demonstrated a sense of responsibility and care. Furthermore, Jon's familiarity with Whatcom County and Ashleigh's strategic expertise have been depicted as invaluable resources, helping clients find not just any home, but their perfect home. Such personalized attention and dedication have prompted clients to label their experiences as the best they've had in real estate.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite the overwhelmingly positive feedback, there are a few instances of dissatisfaction. One user review detailed an interaction where Jon was perceived to have exhibited an unprofessional demeanor when arranging a property viewing for his clients. The reviewer felt treated like a personal secretary, which left a negative impression. Furthermore, there were concerns about his negotiation approach, which the reviewer believed might have resulted in a poor outcome for his clients. This experience highlights potential areas for improvement in communication and client representation. Another user allocated a mediocre score, hinting at an average experience that didn't meet their expectations. Such reviews suggest that while Hansen Group excels in many areas, there may be occasional lapses that require attention.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>In terms of highly negative feedback, the Hansen Group Real Estate has very few such instances; however, one user did leave a one-star review without further explanation. This lack of detail makes it challenging to address specific concerns or discern the root cause of the dissatisfaction. It's noteworthy that owner responses to reviews are somewhat inconsistent, with some negative comments receiving responses while others are seemingly ignored. Without clear specifics from the reviewer, it is difficult to gauge what went wrong or how the team might address these issues. Nevertheless, maintaining open lines of communication and actively engaging with all feedback could help prevent any isolated incidents from overshadowing the generally positive reputation the company holds.</p></section>"
