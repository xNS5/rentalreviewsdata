        "review": "Buyers & Sellers Beware!! \nThis was the worse and most stressful experience ever with a real estate company. I'm completely mortified about the way we were treated, and manipulated. We felt extremely mislead, bullied, were given legal advice on multiple accounts and other extremely unethical practices. They pretend to care, but really don't. Very two-faced. The \"supervisors\" are not any better, they are a joke and don't follow through with a single commitment they make. An alarming fact, the supervisor told me that they deal daily with unhappy clients with their agents!!!! Seriously, daily???? That's a major red flag. Go to John L Scott or Remax, but don't use these guys. \nI wouldn't even give them a single star,  more like 5 thumbs down",

        "review": "As first-time home buyers, my husband and I couldn't have asked for anyone better than William (Bill) Hornbrook as our agent. He exceeded our expectations. We appreciated his responsiveness and knowledge/insights. As high-strung and stressed as I could be, I appreciated that he was never pushy but always patient even when we saw house after house or got discouraged. We had a deadline a few months away and in a demanding market, he directed us to houses within our criteria and though we had a couple of failed offers, he kept an eye on the house we really wanted so when it came to market he immediately let us know. And we got it! Bill immediately sent all paperwork via secure email for convenient electronic signing and easy download. The search was the most stressful part but once we were in escrow with Guild Mortgage (his recommendation!), it was a breeze. We couldn't be happier with the whole process and our lovely new dream home.",
