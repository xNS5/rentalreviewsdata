There ARE rat cluster buddies that like- run around in groups of 20 near and under the dumpster, and I AM scared of them infiltrating this sweet unit during the Winter, but all has been good for now... the unit is completely carpeted with ONE washer and ONE dryer in a room and each load is $2, so $4 to wash and dry a load. It's in a safe area tho and we got a little porch in the trees where you can hear the rats fight~ genuinely really crazy to hear them just go at each other like that. Cool place though~",

        "review": "This is NOT a safe place to live. If you're considering renting here, don't.  The residents include several criminals at this time. I've seen threats left on apartment doors and cars. I'd love to break my lease because I feel unsafe, but aparently I cannot. Cars get keyed all the time. We aren't allowed to recycle. There isn't enough parking for the residents. By the time I had lived here 3 months, we had gone through 3 different property managers, and none of them seemed to have a clue what they were doing. I cannot stress enough how terrible living here is. I have had 0 positive experiences with property managers or other tenants.",
