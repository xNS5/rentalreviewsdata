While noise from a dancehall a block away can be an issue on Fri/Sat, things were quiet by 11 pm on my Thurs-Sun stay, with no street noise or bumps in the night from neighboring rooms.",

        "review": "The Hamlet Hotel is a must.  Would love to keep it \"Our Little Secret\" but will share.  It is comfortable, cozy and stylish.  The comforts of Home.  Spent 2 days and didn't want to leave.  The NightLife on Friday and Saturday nights can be a little LIVELY but the Hamlet provides earplugs.  This doesn't take away from the wonderful charm and comfort that the Hamlet provides.  We stayed in Suite 201 and look forward to staying in the other 3 suites available.  Looking forward to our next stay.",

          "text": "Pam - you are so sweet to take the time to provide your feedback, thank you! Of course, we are delighted that you enjoyed our unique Hamlet and that you and Bill experienced its charms along with the dynamics of our downtown neighborhood.  In the event we are fortunate to host you again, you may appreciate knowing that each of our four suites now also Include LectroFan white noise machines. We expect this can benefit our guests who choose to turn-in before some of the other kiddos \nSafe travels and please come back again, soon!\n\n-Fred"
