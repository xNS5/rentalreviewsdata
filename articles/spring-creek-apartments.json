They have strict rules in place which Makes for a wonderful experience both inside and outside of the apartments. They were very attentive to any fixing needs, usually fixing appliances and such within the hour of me calling them. The recently remodeled apartments are absolutely beautiful inside. I would highly Recommend them to anyone looking for a quiet, nicely kept, and well run apartment complex.",

The recent remodel looks wonderful and they make a genuine effort to make everyone feel that this is their home.  The opportunity for a large garden is rare for an apartment, and the grounds are amazing.  Walking trails, an old growth apple orchard, etc.",

I love the sense of community I've felt here. My neighbors and the staff are so welcoming and quick to fix any issues that have come up. And the location in Bellingham is very convenient.",

We were in the process of being put on the wait list when they asked \"Will it be a family moving in?\" When we explained it would be us three she immediately told us that they wouldn't be able to accept us. We were confused because my partner and I have been living in other apartment units in California together for the past three years and have had no issues regarding us not being a hetero-normative married couple. We further asked why that was an issue and she explained that they've had problems with people breaking leases that made it difficult for the property management. We were trying to explain how discriminatory this sounded while explaining our situation and she said, \"Well this isn't the right place for you then\" and hung up. I have never had an experience quite as homophobic as this. If possible to give a 0 star I would.",

This resident highlights how the management plans inclusive events, indicating a genuine effort to include all tenants regardless of their background, further solidifying Spring Creek Apartments as a desirable living space.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>Despite many positive aspects, some user reviews have highlighted certain drawbacks at Spring Creek Apartments. A recurring issue reported by several reviewers is the thinness of the walls, which can lead to unwanted noise disturbances from neighboring apartments. This concern about privacy and noise is something potential occupants might need to consider. Furthermore, although some have praised the management, others have had less fortunate experiences.</p><p>Particularly, there's mention of unprofessional behavior from management in specific incidents. One applicant found the management to be unaccommodating during a potential lease signing, which resulted in a negative experience and frustration due to perceived discriminatory practices. Another reviewer noted the dissatisfaction with a noisy replacement fridge and felt the need for improvement in the management's communication regarding such maintenance decisions. </p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Several user reviews have expressed serious concerns regarding discriminatory practices by the management at Spring Creek Apartments. One review details a troubling experience where a potential tenant was denied an apartment due to non-traditional family dynamics, which they perceived as discriminatory and homophobic. This allegation of discrimination is a significant blemish and raises concerns about inclusivity and fairness in the leasing process.</p><p>Moreover, there have been instances of alleged rude behavior from the management team, reported by multiple reviewers, which suggest a pattern of poor customer service. One reviewer explicitly described interactions with the manager as condescending and hostile, severely impacting their experience. Such conduct, if prevalent, could deter potential renters and tarnish the property's reputation, highlighting a critical area in need of improvement for the management team.</p></section>"
