We have used property management companies for many years now in several cities. We know that the caliber of companies can vary greatly. The  proactive and professional service provided by this team far exceeds any of our previous experiences. Would recommend them highly.",

        "review": "We used Windemere as our property management for three years. They were difficult to get ahold of and used different 'associate' managers, so there was very little consistency. That would have earned them a three star rating. But when we returned to our property, we were very disappointed with the condition of our home. Even more shocking was that they were willing to return the entire damage deposit to the renter despite obvious damage to our home (holes in drywall, smashed remote, etc). It became an exhausting process of emails back and forth. My 'favorite' part was having to digging through year of receipts to prove to 'my' property manager that I wan't lying when I said I'd purchased new stove knobs for the renter. I enthusiastically do not recommend.",
        "ownerResponse": {
          "text": "I was able to pull up the account and see it was eight years ago. I did address this with you at the time and unfortunately we had to 'agree to disagree'. I still stand by the deposit refund that was issued but understand you still feel the tenant was not charged enough. I am sincerely sorry, but I am governed by Washington State Landlord Tenant Laws and I charged for all items legally allowed (items that were above normal wear and tear). I do wish you didn't have a negative opinion of Windermere Property Management but it is your right to harbor your feelings. This is simply a situation I am not able to rectify."

        "review": "Rented an apartment from them for a year and decided to move into a house after my lease was up. Never in my life have I ever had a rental company keep all of my deposit. Long story short, they fired the manager, ignored my calls and 4 months down the road I talked to a construction crew member that repaired an area with water damage, in the apartment I had rented , keep in mind that I complained 6 months after moving in that I could hear dripping Every time the apartment above me ran their dishwasher. I've asked around and come to find out: not many renters like them or have received a deposit back --minus of course the usual charges for move out cleaning--. I truly hope the new staff has fixed this issue.",

Our records do not show you as a tenant in 2018 and our staff consists of only 2 people; both of us with the company multiple years. I take client satisfaction very seriously and am always here to discuss any concerns but again I do find you in our system. What town is the rental in?"
