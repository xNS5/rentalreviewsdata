        "review": "I met with Jackie and she explained the apartment application process in clear understandable language but also with warmth and clarity about the property and how living at Vintage might be for me. On the tour she showed me everything and every where, even the trash room (which was clean and freshly scrubbed). When we passed other residents they greeted each other and it was evident Jackie has a great relationship with them. The building is in excellent shape even taking in its age; No obvious wear and tear or deferred maintenance. I am looking forward to a future with my dog living at Vintage Bellingham.",

        "review": "The facility looked nice from the outside, but a completely undeserved rude reception this morning from the office manager was a turn off. Dour and unfriendly from the first words out of her lips, to potential new residents no less, is a key indicator of how they operate normally. Yes, we were let in by friendly residents after they saw us struggling to get an answer from the front call button first (which the manager bluntly admitted she didn't answer).   We live by the Golden Rule so were shocked at being treated so coldly for no reason.  We quickly left and found very friendly walk-in receptions at both Spring Creek and Affinity.   I don't normally post comments, but felt anyone looking here should be forewarned.",

There is a real family feel here and the community is so supportive and caring of each other. The apartments are very nice with multiple floor plans to choose from. The laundry and garbage are conveniently located on each floor. The grounds are beautiful and it's relaxing to sit on your balcony or in the gazebo by the flower garden and enjoy nature. Jackie the manager does an amazing job of organizing events for the residents and the Seahawks rallies are a favorite. She is helpful to the community in every way!! David the maintenance supervisor keeps the building in great working order. Jackie and David work so hard to make the Vintage at Bellingham a wonderful place to live. I would recommend it to anyone!",

They recently updated the place (new paint, furniture, landscaping) and it looks great. The Cordata area is such a great place for seniors, as the Peace Health Cordata building is so close for doctor appointments, and a park was just built down the road - in fact, the whole neighborhood is great for walking. An affordable place for seniors to live, that won't bankrupt you!",

Management (Jackie) and maintenance (Dave) have combined to be a perfect fit here. Together they make living here pleasant,  peaceful, safe and relaxing and trouble free. The  place is always kept cleaned and when something needs to be repaired they do the best they can to repair it as soon as possible. If you want to make friends there are card games,  movies,  bingo,  and  a pot luck once a month. Management  has gone out of her way to keep everyone safe from the COVID19  (0 cases)  and while enforcing the rules and regulations keeping everyone happy. I would HIGHLY recommend The Vintage at Bellingham for any Senior single or married.",

Jackie was great to work with to get my mom through the paper work process and made her feel welcome from the very first meeting.  The space is warm and welcoming, even during COVID I felt my mom could sit in any of the open reading area's on each floor and read and have the opportunity to meet people in the community in a safe space.  She has only been there a few weeks but the experience has been very positive.  I can see her enjoying it for many years to come.",

Normally the pool table room, tv room, and game areas are open.  The computer room and exercise room is currently open.. The hairdresser lady still works on second floor but you have to make appt. Some apartments are handicap ready. The apartments are clean and really very lovely but smaller than in older buildings. Perfect for one or two people.",

Its their passion and pride that make this such a happy place to live. The grounds are gorgeous and the apartments have all the amenities you need. Jackie always has something positive to say and if you have a situation, shell sit down and truly listen to you, offer any guidance and if necessary call David to help. We havent had one  case of Covid and thats because of her daily diligence of keeping everyone safe. Its so nice when she has special bbqs, or ice cream specials delivered to your apartment. I feel that she is very, very honest about what goes on in the community and surrounding area. That is the reason so many come to her for advice.

I have a dog and it is great here for being able to walk her here at the park and around this area. Now they have just built a million dollar park which is called Cordata Park which is wonderful for all ages including all seniors across the street. The building is very clean around here. The property is very clean and landscaped and nice around here. The property manager here is wonderful. I also really like that it is on the bus line even though I drive, but sometimes I ride the bus. It's great that we have all of these amenities, exercise room, tv and pool table room and several areas to lounge around in the building as well as kitchen and beauty salon to get your hair done when you don't want to go out. There is a laundry room and rest rooms on every floor. We also have a pop machine and snack machine for those who want to snack that don't always want to leave the building. Also a outdoor patio on the 3rd floor and main floor. It's really a positive place, likeable place it grows on you and you can go to church when things go back to normal. There is always a gathering of some sort on Sundays, Bingo, Card games, dominos , movie nights and coffee for those who like and wish to use a computer we have a business center as well. Plus the entire staff is working very hard for all the seniors at vintage clean and sanitized and David is doing a really great job in fixing things and with the garbage around here.\n\nSo if that all sounds good come and check it out.",

Looking for a place to live that not only would be convenient to services and shopping but would have a community feel to it also. Not only is it convenient but it goes beyond that with The Manager who truly takes her job to heart and has come to this community and within one year has cleared up many issues including giving the tenants the feeling of inclusiveness and the feeling of safety that they did not have. Everyone is treated equally and respectfully. The Vintage at Bellingham has a cleaning crew, maintenance person and Lanscaping crew that always keep us looking clean and tidy. During the Covid-19 pandemic the manager and fpi management have kept every resident up to date as to CDC recommendations as well as coverage from the governor of Washington state.\n\nIf Clean, tidy, close to shopping, access to medical facilities , safety , well maintained property and great management and staff mean something to you then I would seriously tell you to come check out a great place to live Vintage at Bellingham.",

  "summary": {
    "text": "<section><h2>Good</h2><p>Residents of Vintage at Bellingham have expressed satisfaction with the apartment complex, highlighting its cleanliness and maintenance. The community\u2019s sentiment reflects well on the property management, specifically noting the prompt and efficient handling of maintenance requests, affirming that issues, even if minor, are resolved on the same day. The property's state of upkeep is corroborated in multiple user reviews, with one resident emphatically indicating their appreciation for the experience of living in a quiet, safe, and clean facility, which is attributed to the meticulous attention to detail by the management staff.</p></section><section><h2>Great</h2><p>Exceptional management seems to be a recurring theme in the user reviews, with the Community Director, Jackie, receiving acknowledgments for her responsiveness, kindness, and the sense of safety she provides for the residents. The proactive approach by the property management to organize activities and maintain a vibrant community spirit, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is also commended. The grounds of Vintage at Bellingham are consistently described as beautiful and inviting, which, along with the personalized attention from the staff, including a helpful maintenance team, contributes to a highly regarded living environment for seniors.</p></section><section><h2>Bad</h2><p>While mostly favorable, there are instances where user experiences have been less than ideal. A reviewer who experienced difficulty with the online scheduling system voiced frustration, indicating potential technical or communication shortcomings. Additionally, one episode of reportedly rude reception by the office manager stands out among the largely positive narratives, suggesting that on rare occasions, interactions with management may not meet expectations, which could be an area for further attention and improvement by the property management team.</p></section><section><h2>Ugly</h2><p>Amidst the overwhelming positive feedback, there's an isolated incident of dissatisfaction from a user who felt compelled to leave a negative review after an apparently unpleasant encounter with the office manager. This reviewer felt that they were treated coldly and abruptly, which led them to seek accommodation elsewhere. While such incidents seem to be uncommon, as indicated by the property\u2019s high adjusted average rating, they nevertheless highlight that even a single negative experience can resonate deeply with prospective residents and potentially affect the property's reputation.</p></section>"
