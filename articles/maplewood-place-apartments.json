        "review": "Cheap apartments but you get what you pay for. Management not on site. They give no cares about any problems that arise(which many will that are most likely not your doing) and in fact they will  most likely turn it around to make it about you and how it's your fault and your responsibility. The neighbors alone will make you cringe. Noise at all hours, definitely drugs dealers who have people going in and out. Parking lot is beyond small for all that live there, good luck trying to even fit a regular sized car in those parking spots when it's full. Good luck not getting your car smashed or scratched because others that live there do not understand how to back out or enter such small spaces. Management does a horrible job at communicating all together to new tenants, so if you work late and the only spot you pay for has been taken by someone else. There's nothing you can do. Overflow is always full and street parking as well. So you're looking at illegally parking at the Free masons lodge across the street or miles away from your apartment. Enjoy the cold! It isn't until you ask management to get on the apartment towing list to be able to actually call the tow company and get a car towed out of your spot, not on your dime, when such things happen. But after that happens the first time, good luck not getting your car keyed. There are many who try to warn others about Apex, heed their warning, unlike me who didn't. I will be posting pictures of obvious no goes on this place.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>This article focuses on the overall experience at Maplewood Place Apartments, highlighting both the positive aspects\u2014though limited\u2014and areas of concern. However, the user reviews available depict very few positives, as there is primarily one review that paints a bleak picture of the property management. The only slight acknowledgment of the property\u2019s affordability can be viewed as a silver lining for prospective tenants, underlining that the rent is low, but often leading to compromised living conditions.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The current sentiment indicates limited great experiences reported by tenants at Maplewood Place Apartments. Since there is strictly one review available and it carries a negative tone, there are no notable great features or commendable aspects highlighted by users. Prospective tenants may find it difficult to derive any encouragement from user reviews thus far as feedback from positive tenants is conspicuously absent.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>The sentiment in this article leans heavily towards the negative due to the poor experiences shared in user reviews. One user recounts issues with management responsiveness, stating that problems arising within the apartments are met with indifference and often blamed on tenants rather than being addressed. Furthermore, the report of inadequate parking facilities exacerbates the situation, leading to frustrations among residents who struggle to find satisfactory parking solutions, often needing to park illegally far from the property.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>This article illustrates the serious concerns tenants face at Maplewood Place Apartments, with the user review detailing alarming issues like noise disturbances and the presence of apparent drug activity nearby. Such experiences have created a sense of unease among residents, with one user warning others about potential safety hazards. The management's lack of effective communication and poor handling of maintenance problems presents a disheartening picture, emphasizing a troubling environment that could cause significant stress for current and prospective tenants alike.</p></section>"
