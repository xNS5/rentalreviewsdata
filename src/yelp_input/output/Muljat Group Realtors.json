      "review": "Sophia Evans of the Muljat group Bellingham was incredible as our agent from start to finish! She was highly recommended from our mortgage broker as someone who had the right amount of push and pull and a \"bull dog\" as they put it.  She was exactly that, just when you needed her to be. Sophia communicated impeccably, with us and the other agents involved and she was truly great at getting the necessary information to put forth the strongest and best offer on our behalf. We always knew she had our absolute best interests at heart and she was never willing to let us settle during moments of anxiety or fear. We couldn't have asked for more from our agent and we are forever thankful to her and Muljat for helping find us our dream home in a housing market where that seemed nearly impossible.",

      "review": "So I found a great realtor, Gordon Neufeld, to help me purchase my first home in Bellingham. He is extremely patient and thoughtful, and will answer all of your questions, no matter how trivial. He was recommended to me by two other faculties from WWU who have purchased homes with him and were very satisfied. His knowledge of the area and diligence is what sets him apart from others. Lastly, he does not pass off as \"slick\", unlike some of the other realtors. However, I have had no experience working with other people from the Muljat Group so I cannot say for the others.",

      "review": "Their agent, Jon Rockwood, lied to me, telling me I would get the winning bid on a house if I increased my offer by $1500. The next morning he said someone else had increased their bid by $5000 and I needed to do the same, so he just used me to start a bidding war. So I told my realtor they will not only get my money for this house, but they wouldn't for any future real estate transaction. I don't mind looking out for the best interests of your seller, but not at the cost of lying.",
