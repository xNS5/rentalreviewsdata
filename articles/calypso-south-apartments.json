My husband and I have lived here for over a year and a half and have gone through multiple management companies but Olympic is the best. Chanelle and Nicole are wonderful and really listen to the things being said. I know my neighbors and they are all nice and who doesn't love the dog washing station! Out of all the apartments I have lived in, this one is the best.",
