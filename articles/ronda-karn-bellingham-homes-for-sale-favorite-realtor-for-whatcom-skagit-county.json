We moved out of state before the house officially closed, but with Ronda, we never had to worry that something would be missed. I highly recommend working with her if you are buying or selling your home!",

We researched local real estate agents and spoke to a few prior to making a decision. Ronda stood out to us immediately - so it was easy for us to know we wanted to work with her. She is extremely knowledgeable, professional, and went above and beyond in so many ways. She's an amazing negotiator too, and really makes you feel like your success and happiness is her goal. Ronda and her team made our first home buying experience so smooth, stress-free, and extremely enjoyable. We found our dream home faster than expected, and knew we would miss working with her after closing. She is just amazing! If you are considering Ronda as your real estate agent, this is your sign!",

It's a very competitive market in our area and she worked very hard to find exactly what we were looking for.  Ronda responds to email, text messages, and voicemail very promptly.  She is very knowledgable about the market, and provides good advice as well.  Well done :-)",
