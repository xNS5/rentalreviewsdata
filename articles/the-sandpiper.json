        "review": "If you love silverfish you should live here!! I lived in Sandpiper (unit 211) and it was infested with silverfish all year. I started noticing them 3 months into moving in. Because Im scared of bugs, I mostly stayed in my partners apartment so I was rarely at my own. Still, with the dehumidifier running almost every day & barely using the bathroom to prevent moisture, they were everywhere. The apartment helped me by calling Pest Control and so around 75% of the silverfish I would find were already dead. But its gross. The whole building is infested, my friend who moved into a unit above mine recently found some in her bathroom as well. Other than that, Im giving it 2 stars for being modern, affordable, and downtown accessible housing. I loved everything else about living here except the Silverfish & my upstairs gaming neighbor who would scream and bang on his desk until 4am every night :)",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>The Sandpiper is noted for its responsive service, with users highlighting that they received help promptly when issues arose. One tenant appreciated the management's efforts in addressing pest control by calling in professionals to tackle the silverfish problem, indicating that there is an intention to maintain the property despite some shortcomings. The building's modern amenities and affordability, along with its convenient downtown location, also received positive remarks from tenants, suggesting that many feel the aesthetic and logistical aspects of the property meet their needs.</p><p>Additionally, the downtown accessibility is a significant advantage for tenants who prioritize being near urban conveniences. The overall ambiance of the apartments is described as up-to-date, which aligns well with the modern living preferences of many renters today. Despite the challenges faced by some tenants, the existence of responsive management strengthens the positive perception of the property.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>User reviews do suggest that The Sandpiper has offered an overall satisfactory experience for some renters, especially highlighting the excellent service from the management. One user specifically mentioned great service and responsiveness, indicating that the team is available and willing to assist tenants when they reach out. This level of support can greatly enhance a tenant's living experience, making it easier to navigate any issues that may arise during their stay.</p><p>The building's modern design and location are consistently mentioned as highlights, making it an attractive choice for young professionals and those seeking a vibrant community. With an average rating of 3.5 out of 5, there exists a segment of renters who found the property to exceed their expectations in various aspects, particularly in service quality.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><pDespite some positive aspects, numerous user reviews indicate areas where The Sandpiper falls short, particularly regarding pest management. One tenant reported an ongoing infestation of silverfish that persisted despite efforts to mitigate the issue with a dehumidifier. Although management attempted to address the problem through pest control services, the overall acceptance of bug presence could be viewed as a critical oversight on their part.</p><pFurthermore, the noise issue raised by the same tenant about disturbances from neighbors suggests that sound insulation may not be adequate. Such complaints highlight a recurring theme of tenant discomfort that the management may need to address in order to enhance overall tenant satisfaction moving forward.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>While most reviews were moderate, one looming issue is the ongoing pest problem that was reported as having significantly disrupted a tenant's living experience. The silverfish infestation affected multiple units, indicating a potential systemic issue within the building that has not been adequately resolved. Such pest concerns can tarnish the reputation of the property and create an uncomfortable living environment for all residents.</p><pAdditionally, the lack of active engagement from management in responding publicly to user reviews may lead to an impression of neglect or indifference. Addressing tenant concerns directly in reviews can help mitigate negative perceptions and improve overall trust in the management, especially in light of reported issues that could discourage potential renters.</p></section>"
