        "review": "I unfortunately lived here for 1 whole school year, and boy did I encounter a ton of interesting things.\n\nPros: Maintenance crew. These guys are the only thing keeping this place afloat, and they dont even have that large of a team, quick responses to tickets for apartment issues when I sent items in (bulbs out or closet off the tracks).\n\nCons: Lack of security, Managers, front hosts, price\n\nSecurity: Not only did I encounter a homeless man passed out in the stairwell when going in for a morning final, I had my car vandalized within the garage of this complex, as well as encountered a trespasser at 4am lurking around my floor looking for unlocked rooms. I too came across someones back car window smashed out and items stolen within (premium parking spot, 2nd floor garage).\n\nThe garage is a hotspot for sketchy things to happen, and this all stems from the company being too cheap to install a gate, the maintenance team recommended this a while back, but the company refused it due to the cost.\n\nManagers: I dont understand how these people still have jobs, they sit at their desk for 8 hours managing the front hosts, and dont do anything useful, theyre not lenient in re-scheduling room checks for people out of town for holidays, theyre not useful in managing noise complaints against other rooms, and from previous posts it also seems as if they cant even get security deposits back to people within a timely manner.\n\nFront hosts - I understand they are college students, so theres only so much they can do with their useless managers, so again not much complaints for them, rather how they are managed. They respond quick to noise complaint responses via text within working hours, but those complaints werent of any help as the I continued to send complaints over (manager not taking action). But apart from that, they are helpful over the phone with questions and helpful when filling out paperwork.\n\nPrice: The apartment price doesnt come with the cost of the monthly garage price; and for the cost of this place, it wasnt worth it. The room itself you pay for an internet router that is on the ceiling, a lack luster living room that is furnished, skimpy drawers for your room and a rock solid prison bed. Not to mention the jail like courtyard that no one ever used.\n\nAll in all, this place is at best a 2/5, for location to campus and the maintenance staff. I would stay away if you can, there are plenty of other better spots around (New England apartments for example). This company will soon go under, it seems like their owner is also running his other locations as poorly as this one in other states, which makes sense as to why the onsite managers are as useless as they are. Unfortunately the maintenance team isnt getting the resources they need in order to keep this place afloat. As for what we are paying, they should have plenty of funds to manage their costs and upkeep, but the owner is losing money, so hes cutting his spending unfortunately. Spend your money on a house or other well managed properties if you can, if this happens to be your last resort, just expect to encounter what Ive written out.",

        "review": "The things that the management do and don't do here is audacious.\nThings that they do: ask for rent early, walk into your apartment without notice while your girlfriend is changing, randomly shutoff the water, violate the lease agreement terms multiple times. Things that they don't do: fix the security cameras, fix broken locks, have functioning handicap accessibility buttons, clean up the broken glass from the several cars that have been broken into, clean up the puke that has been in the parking garage for over a month now, respect their tenants. Do not live here unless it is a LAST RESORT",

        "review": "Pros:\nPretty solid apartments. Pricey, but all the appliances are good quality and function well. Nice amenities, including an awesome top-floor deck overlooking downtown, full gym, and study lounge. Close proximity to both campus and downtown is a huge plus. Maintenance staff are fantastic and fixed every issue my roommates and I had within a few hours usually.\n\nCons:\nIn the 3 years I lived here, though, I found there to be an overabundance of irritating, immature people living here. If you live here, be prepared for a fair amount of noise and to be surrounded with people who don't care about others and vandalize exit signs, handrails, floor signs, and all manner of other things. This isn't necessarily the fault of the complex, but it's something to know if you decide to live here. They don't empty the trash room on the 3rd floor enough either, so it was disgusting and overflowing much of the time. Also, because it's on a major road to downtown in a college town, be prepared to hear a lot of loud cars, trucks and motorbikes with modified exhausts. Internet speeds are decent (25mbps down and up), but stability is questionable.\n\nOverall, I don't regret living here, and while I can't say how it compares to other apartments in Bellingham (I only lived in the dorms my first year and here my other 3), it's solid if you're willing to spend a lot. It seems like Elevate gets a lot of hate, and I don't think most of it is justified.",

        "review": "Loved the living experience. The room is great and I dont hear much from my fellow neighbors. My one critique is that they arent very clean regarding the fitness room and hallways. I wish they vacuumed and maintained the fitness equipment like their yoga balls, basic cleanliness, and replace broken equipment (like the punching bag). The staff is very friendly and have fun activities for their residents. Maintenance requests are dealt with in a timely manner. There are wifi/ internet problems here and there but overall not an issue day to day.",

        "review": "This is my second year living at Elevate and I've renewed my lease for next year. I love living here! When I first visited, Corbin gave me a great tour and from there the application process was easy and the employees were very helpful and kind. I feel safe living here as there is a key fob system so the keys can't be copied and there are locks on nearly every door in the whole building. The facility is always clean and the staff members who fill maintenance requests are always very friendly and helpful. The apartments are spacious and the windows are nice and large. Elevate is pet friendly too, so having a cat has been very easy. Elevate also does a lot of awesome events and giveaways and they offer free printing (you just have to bring paper). The apartment is the perfect distance from the WWU campus- it usually takes me about 5-10 minutes to walk to campus. Overall I would highly recommend Elevate!",

        "review": "I moved out on August 31st of last year and did not receive my deposit back. There were promises being made that it would get back but no results. However, the Elevate Bellingham property management wasnt necessarily the bad guy in this case and were very communicative and were mostly just the middleman to get stuff done right.\nThe issue lies with the management company and their tardiness and lax behavior towards getting people the deposit they are owed. After a whole year of communication I can confirm that Veronica, the community manager, was nothing but kind and helpful and truly wanted to right the wrongs that management was doing. Im not saying what they did isnt bad, but from a property level Elevate did all they could to help.",
