        "review": "Lived here for about two years.\n\nThe initial impression was bad - the landlord seemed to not know how to sound anything other than snappy/rude on the phone, almost even condescending.  Thought maybe I was making a mistake, but gave it a try since I like townhome-style apartments.\n\nLocation was great - close to WWU, close to grocery stores and restaurants, gas station right around the corner right before easy access to the freeway onramp - and a small farm next door that sold fruits and vegetables - a bonus. Did some walking around at night throughout the year - pretty safe neighbourhood.\n\nCome to think of it I don't think I ever saw the landlord while I lived there - he was like a phantom in the mist - I know he was around the premises from time to time though - to remove snow from the walkways or tape some notices on the door and whatnot.\n\nThe maintenance guy deserves most of the credit for my staying there for two years. He was quick to respond to maintenance requests, very efficient, courteous, accomodating and always friendly. Wave and he will definitely wave back.\n\nThe unit I was in, had a neighbour who made loud, rhythmical noise all night - made my bedroom feel like a cheap club. Sometimes their pet elephant slammed into the wall and dragged itself along the hallway, or a balled up armadillo bounced down their stairs for the hell of it. Lost many hours of sleep and much, much sanity. However, I am not taking stars out of the apartment because I figured I just drew a short straw.\n\nIn the end I have come believe that the landlord is proud of his property since he takes good care of it. He was responsive to my emails/calls, and despite his rather impolite ways, in the end I got used to it and stopped getting offended.\n\nI would definitely go back and live there if I ever return to Bellingham - just not the same unit so I can avoid that neighbour.",

        "review": "Sehome Court has been a really great place to live for the past four years. The owner and maintenance person are very helpful and responsive. The property is well kept. Maintenance issues are handled immediately. The price is very reasonable for a spacious two bedroom apartment. They are strict with rules regarding parking and smoking but that helps make it a great place to live.",

Very clean and there is an on site maintenance person who will fix any emergency issues and also keep up on all ongoing projects to improve living conditions. Neighbors were kind and respectful, appreciated how the owner screened tenants well. Would highly recommend",

        "review": "I would like to say that the customer service I received while trying to fill out the application was one of the worst experiences I have ever encountered. There were too many red flags with the management. When I was trying to drop off the application papers there was a man in front of the office building who very rudely told me I had to leave and I tried to tell him that I needed to drop off some application papers and he kept interrupting me and telling me to leave. The first time I called them I was being asked personal questions that go against HIPAA. When I was asking him questions that I had about my lease, he made it seem like I was the one who was wasting his time. Ive worked in customer service and the way that the manager talks to the applicants is so unprofessional and condescending. The manager is disrespectful and doesnt know how to run a business. Ive had so many issues",
