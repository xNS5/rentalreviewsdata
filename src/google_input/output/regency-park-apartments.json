I had to make this private account because you can't complain anymore without being chastised (Julie is no longer here to take tenants seriously anymore). The large, Bald male with a red beard cursed me out and proceeded to threaten me with physical violence over their inability to keep the dumpster clear. The only reason I didn't call the police is because I diffused the situation by leaving the scene. This is my first time having to post a bad review for Regency, but they need a new maintenance crew. Many other people are complaining about him as well, BEWARE!",

He is the reason we are reporting Regency to Tenants Revolt. He called us discriminatory names under his breath while inspecting our apartment (after 9 years of living here, we've never experienced this with previous maintenance). Julie is the only redeeming quality to Regency after Michelle and Hans left. Julie is so sweet, she always tries to help you out. Diane is awesome, she needs to replace Deneen. Deneen will lie to you, she will insult you back-handedly and treat you like a child. When you really need her help, she'll treat you like a peasant. Michelle and Hans were so heart-felt and understanding, the sense of community is COMPLETELY LOST. We are saving up to leave this place. Why did Michelle and Hans leave? Please come back... We miss you so much. The new maintenance is terrible. Stay away from Regency, this place is becoming more dangerous as the months slip by, I'm not sure who's doing background checks, but just Google Regency Park Apartments crime in Bellingham.

The management can invade your privacy, have many rules, make you sign papers throughout the whole lease period (multiple times), and not just once at the beginning/end.  Every 3 months or sometimes less, they come in to your place to do checks on cleanliness, the fire detectors, and random procedures. They even keep track of your car in the parking lot and count how many days your gone. They also have rules of visitors and how long they are allowed to stay. No visitor can stay longer than 5 hours and can't come over days back to back. They are nice at first, but over time you will find out that they are rude and can be pretty unprofessional at times. I was not satisfied with being there. The price is descent for what you get. I just really didn't like the experience. Also, there are many kids around and if you live near the park, the kids get super loud and its incredibly disturbing.",

Any time I have submitted a maintenance request the request is always responded to within the time range they tell you they can get to it. The office staff are WONDERFUL! I've never had an issue with any of them to date. They are welcoming, professional, and they even remember me by name, something I very much appreciate. There are frequent inspections- an annual investors/insurance inspection, smoke detector inspections, etc.that can feel a little invasive, but honestly it's ok because they are keeping on top of making sure the property is safe and maintained well and you are given ample notice that they will be entering your unit.\n\nAlso, they host a number of community events/socials, have a pool, fitness room, and theater open for party rentals.\n\nAs for neighbors...that is pretty hit and miss, but that is life in an apartment complex. The \"bad\" neighbors don't seem to last long anyway.",

The major problem is the noise level from the large amount of children, if you cannot deal with a ridiculous amount of cursing and screaming from children as young as 3 then stay far away from Regency Park.  DO NOT rent an apartment adjacent to the playground, your window WILL be used as a goal for whatever ball game the little rats decide to play that day.",

      "review": "I absolutely despise Regency for very good reasons and here's why.\n1. Every few months the rent goes up more and more, and now Regency isn't so affordable anymore.\n\n2. The management is often TERRIBLE!!! To start off with, the owner is snide, stuck up, rude, and uncaring. Every time one of us talks to her she says some sort of snide remark, is very impolite, and just brushes off everything you say to her. Hauns, her husband, is okay, but really conniving and a liar. During an inspection he'll tell you everything is totally fine, and then you get a notice the next day saying you have to clean or fix something or else you're evicted. He also always says he'll do something and then never actually does it. The rest of the management isn't TOO horrible, but they're usually poorly trained and unprofessional. We usually digitally sign our lease, but there have been MULTIPLE times where the management just completely loses our lease somewhere, then blames us for it and says we never signed it. They have also lost our rent checks before, blaming us for that as well. The only good thing about them, is at least the former manager Cindy no longer works here. She was by far the most stuck up, bitchy, uncaring, conniving, and just all around terrible person I've ever met.\n\n3. They have CONSTANT inspections and often give you little to no warning. We are now on our third inspection THIS MONTH. It is February 10th.....yea.... They usually have an inspection for some sort of stupid reason at least every 2-3 months. The worst part is that they come in, say you're totally fine, and then give you an eviction notice the next day for stuff a simple as a COUPLE dishes in the sink, one small thing being in front of the heater that takes two seconds to move, or a SMALL amount of clothes somewhere that hasn't been put away yet. Seriously these guys give out eviction notices for ANYTHING they can find.\n\n4. It's a terrible place. The surrounding streets, stores, and schools are nice, but they're not the problem. The problem is the terrible neighbors, the constant police visits, and the management doing nothing about any of this! Seriously I can't count how many times I've complained about my upstairs AND downstairs neighbors slamming things, screaming, or blasting music at all hours of the night, but does Regency do anything about it? No. No they don't. The place has serious drug problems and there was even a shooting a few years ago. Not a safe place for your kids. Not to mention even the KIDS have problems! Probably because their parents aren't usually good people if they live here. The kids steal, scream at all hours, cuss, and start drugs and drinking early on. I implore you, if you have children and want them to actually grow up decently, keep them FAR away from this place.\n\n5. Maintenance is unreliable. If something is broken, you go and tell the office and get simple papers done. Then you sit and wait for weeks while they keep telling you they're planning on coming but never do. I always see them chatting with each other and doing nothing. They just don't care.\n\nAll in all, Regency is a terrible place run by uncaring people who act like they care when they really don't. They're lazy, disrespectful, and overall just very uncaring. If you can avoid living here, please try.",

At one point, they attempted to charge us for trash removal from the hallway when there was no trash for them to remove.  And when I showed her proof of it, she said she still wouldn't remove the charge while addressing me rudely.  It's been 27 days since we moved out and we never received our deposit back or a mailed statement stating why they haven't returned it and now I have to get a lawyer involved to deal with them.  They constantly close the pool during the summer, they don't have it open during any reasonable hours for there not to be screaming children in it and they baby sit everyone in the pool.  Never had an apartment complex like this before.  Also, because it is low income, the majority of the people act the stereotype of lower class and there is a lot of crime.  I'd say there was police there 5 out of 7 days of the week at minimum.  Lots of drug activity.  Also, I paid 1,050 ish for a 1088 sqft apartment and I currently live in a 1,200 sqft apartment for (drum role please) $950 a month and it is in way better shape.  Do not, under any circumstances, live at these apartments.  And if you do, let me say \"I told you so\" now.  Might as well get that out of the way.
