Their application fee is $65, compared to $50 for most other property managers in Bellingham, but so far that is our only criticism. Move-in is in September so will update with any new feedback then, but they have so far proven trustworthy, communicative and friendly. And their portal is really helpful also!",

There were many hoops I had to jump through when he was verifying my rental history due to errors from my prior management companies, and Frank was patient and understanding throughout the whole process. After I got it cleared up he sent us notification that we were approved for the unit as well. He was communicative throughout the whole process, which is something that spoke volumes to me, especially given that my current management company doesnt communicate with their tenants about anything. Overall, I had a great experience with the application process with Landmark!",

Our family of 6 has had the best experience with them since day one! They moved mountains so we could move in almost 2 weeks early with our 5 day old baby. They have also been fair and effective when dealing with neighborly disputes. Our assigned property manager, Cami Winslow, has been absolutely wonderful and the most understanding. We feel very blessed to have found this place and this great company at such a stressful time in our lives.",

Ive felt like every concern Ive had over the 3 years Ive been a tenant has been answered in a prop and timely manner.  Most renters have encountered challenges with their rental. A appliance goes out, issues with a fuse box etc which is of course to be expected. Any homeowner can tell you the challenges one can face within the home and what it takes to fix it.  As a renter, its so important to have a landlord or management company that takes these issues seriously and fixes them promptly.  Fortunately with our Manager Cami Winslow, every concern or issue has been resolved quickly and fixed correctly.  Knowing that these things will be fixed when needed is invaluable and the biggest reason we are staying with Landmark and at our current residence.",

        "review": "I am tenant and I had a flood happen in my apartment recently. There was a gap in communication with my property manager, but when I tried to follow up, I reached the front desk. Ocean, the first lady I spoke with, was rude and short with me. She doesn't tell you what she is going to do she just sends you off to someone. I asked her not to just send me off to a voicemail, because this was a time sensitive matter and instead of talking with me to solve this issue, she transferred me anyway. When I called back in, I got someone else (I can't remember her name, unfortunately) and she was extremely disrespectful. I don't know what happened in the two minutes it took me to call back, but as soon as I introduced myself, she had a terrible attitude. Immediately was talking over me, cutting me off when I tried to explain the situation, raised her voice at me, and accused me of yelling at her. It was the WORST customer service interaction I've ever had. She was extremely rude, disrespectful, unkind, unwilling to help resolve the issue at hand, as is her job. She is obviously incapable of handling that position, if that is how she treats the tenants calling in for assistance. I asked to be transferred to her supervisor, and she was snarky about it, but luckily transferred me right away. I spoke with Wendy. Wendy was amazing. Clearly, knew how to do her job, and what customer service meant. Literally, all I wanted was an escalation so that my property manager knew that I was trying to reach her about a time sensitive issue. That's it. That's a completely reasonable request, and Wendy was able to  help me with that in 5 minutes. So, in my experience, don't go into that office, expecting to be treated with dignity. At least not by those two workers. They showed very clearly that they have no desire to be respectful or uphold any standard to customer service.",

        "review": "What can you expect from a rental company? They were pretty bad, but mostly for the lack of effort and communication they put in. Its nice to be left alone as a tenant, we never had the quarterly inspections or really anyone give us a hard time (except once when they told us we had to mow our lawn, it definitely looked better long but I understand).\nHowever, this lack of communication is why we really didn't enjoy their management. We never (not once!) got emails back when we had questions, if things broke (and things were broken most of the time) it took hours and many, many phone calls to get a hold of anyone. I missed multiple days of classes trying to get in touch with someone about our heating being out during the coldest month of February (it got below 15 degrees and we had no heat in our house).\nOn that note, there were so many issues with our house which were genuine safety concerns - windows being painted shut, our single toilet consistently breaking (like at least twice a month) and then randomly starting again -- we once called the emergency line because it was a weekend and their response was that we needed to wait until Monday... there were 5 of us and ONE TOILET. Their solution to the no heat problem was to send over 6 space heaters, which immediately flipped the circuits and forced our fridge and freezer to shut off. Our stove top looked like someone had shot at it (literally bullet hole looking things) and the \"5th\" bedroom they advertised was the size of a walk in closet and I as a 5'2 person could stand straight up only right inside the door. There was no windows in that room and it got above 110 degrees on sunny summer days. I lived in the basement because the fifth bedroom was not a room, the dryer very near to when we moved in got a disconnected aluminum tube that was supposed to send hot wet air outside. Well, it instead filled my room with all of that wet hot air anytime any one used it. We asked them to fix it, got asked to be sent photos, and after we did, no one ever followed up or came to look at it. I tried taping it myself but the moisture was to intense for the tape to stick. My entire room and most of my stuff was often damp for a full year.\nI was often genuinely concerned for my well being and the well being of my roommates and I am so glad we decided to move.",

Moving is stressful and nobody needs the property manager themselves making it harder than it has to be. If she is still my PM when moving units Im already planning on asking for a new one.",

When I was moving out the property manager (Sarah Lynn Mazza or something) said the people in my apartment complex live like roaches. They had no record of allowing me access to the shared garage beneath my apartment and I lost personal items including $60 snow shoes. PSE accidentally had a problem with my account and charged both Landmark and I, and Landmark also charged us to pay them back. When we got it settled with PSE they informed us that Landmark is to pay us back and Landmark said its not their responsibility. They were stingy about my last security deposit, and were rude in general. I left renting through landmark and chose to rent through somewhere else. Then my landlord sold out to landmark and upon taking over they immediately raised my old cracked walls one bedroom apartment in Ferndale with no in house laundry or dishwasher (or garage or anything special) from $900 / mo to $1,200 / mo in one go.

Recently, they changed the new team and it's horrible. I filed for work order on April 27th because the freezer stopped making ice. She followed up with me with a message and I answered her message that the freezer just suddenly stopped working. Then, she just forgot about this email. Now, without a question, if it's suddenly stopped making ice, a normal person would assume something went wrong with the freezer and cooler. However, this lady adressed that I didn't mention anything about the cooler not working. First, who would jump to conclusion immediately without analyzing for information. Second, she didn't want to admit it's her fault for not responding to my email and insisted that we have been communicating via emails, in fact, that didn't happen. Third, she gave me that BS of new construction so it's under warranty and they can't send their men into the unit. Moreover, I called today and brought up this again. The agent answered very unprofessional. \"We need name and address, that's more important\" with a terrible attitude and tone. Where's \"We are sorry that happened to you, can we please get a name and address?\" Even McDonald employees are more friendly than Landmark customer service associates. I don't know if we should stay with Landmark for future. This is just very bad experience and unprofessional working ethics from the employees. We are currently paying 3,800-4,000$+ a month for Landmark and for this price, the sastisfaction we received is low to terrible.\nIt's been 9 days of room temperature food. If anything happens, expect a lawsuit. We have plenty of time and resources to make sure that this is heard !",

Prompt maintenance, responce to emails, and clear communication (I am also the person to read every word in a contract, which helps avoid surprises because I know what I am getting into. Definitely reccomend for some of these 1 star people). They do have a weird thing with lease takeovers where the security deposit continues through the years, but if you trust your takeover people then we simply figured it out like adults and the people moving in paid the people moving out. It is a weird law but not the end if the world. I also appreciate that we can pay a securing deposit for an apartment we like before viewing or before our applications are processed. Sure, it is a gamble as to whether we get our money back, but it is a well informed one that we take advantage of in the competitive apartment world of bellingham.

Every year in November I get a notice letting me know I need to provide a copy of my renewed renters policy. As an insurance agent I encourage all RENTERS to get a renters policy but also make sure the Property Mgmt CO is listed as an Additional interested party. This ensures that a copy is sent to them at each renewal. This does not however eliminate your reminder notice threatening a charge for not uploading to the portal your new policy. I do know that Landmark will upload the notice for you if they receive it. Most insurers send 30 plus days prior to the renewal the notice just like they do with Mortgage Companies who most likely are paying the bill for the homeowner out of escrow funds. If you are not sure you can call Landmark and ask if the portal shows your active version of the policy. Its extra steps but may reduce some frustration otherwise.  Good luck!",

HOWEVER, I called the office and spoke to Ashley, who was so understanding and incredible. I had called my bank and I was pretty sure that the charge wouldn't go through at all, but I won't know until after my rent payment is technically late. She not only assured me that it obviously was not my fault that the charge was incorrect, but she helped me fix the whole mess that I am in and made sure that I would not be charged any late fees for when it is fixed. Other than that, I haven't had any other issues with Landmark. She did say that this happened to a few people though, so I would check in with them to make sure that your online account is set up right before the last few months of your lease. They really need to change their system.\nTheir customer service regarding the main office has always been great for me though.

Any extra service or change of tenancy is a non refundable fee, even if you don't go through with it. Wouldn't let my wife and child live with me, the legality of that is beyond me. Rent is outrageous for what you get, parking spaces in my complex were below the legal size, and just in general rude to their tenants. It's unbelievable they can get away with this, something needs to be done in this country about these landlords/REM companies. Don't go through Landmark if you can avoid it, which I know is hard since only a few companies operate in Bellingham.",

When I first toured a few of their units the agent showed up late and high. The first unit we were showed seemed like the current tenant was not made aware or the unit being showed. Her underwear and belongings were all over the place. It was very uncomfortable and if I were in their shoes I would not want strangers walking around my apartment and touching my underwear; which leads me to the second reason. Landmark tried to show my aparment without my consent months before the end of my lease. They notfied me they were going to show up and expected my apartment to be cleaned. The day they chose I had work and class, I could not be there. They said it didnt matter and they were going to show up anyways. When I complained, they half quoted a law that allows landlords to show units and asked me to write them a statement explaining why I didnt want to show my unit so they could give it to their lawyers. After a quick google search I found the law they quoted and noticed they only stated half of the law, it explicitly says that a landord cannot show a unit without the tenants pressence or consent. Even then, they insisted on showing my unit. They only stopped once I notified them that I had valuable delicate computer equipment, a firearm, and that I would press charges if they trespassed without my consent. Landmark has no regard for privacy, once you sign their lease they will stop showing any sense of respect. The whole time I was emailing back and forth with their office, the lady I was speaking to kept forwarding me their internal emails. In their conversations they were being very disrespectful and outright vulgar while referring to me.\n\nPlease just avoid Landmark, talk to any local before you sign and they will tell you how bad it is.\nIf you're a college student, save yourself the pain and simply find another apartment. Dealing with work, school and a landlord that wants a dozen people touching your belongings was the most stressing week I ever had.",

Long story short, they are as unprofessional and crooked as the rest of the reviews say, even if they manage to put on a good face for a while.\n\nAfter signing a mutual lease termination in October, they allowed my ex-roommate to stay on the premises for an additional 45 days, during which time he didn't pay rent, utilities, or keep the place clean. At the time they told me not to worry about it, the lease termination meant I wasn't responsible for anything he did after.\nAfter they served him a pay or vacate notice he left, but the apartment was trashed. I offered to clean it up before they did the final move out, as I felt bad he'd been so irresponsible and appreciated what I thought was their help. They told me I wasn't allowed to go back and clean or repair anything because I terminated my lease months ago.\n\nThen, in March, about a week after I move out of the Tullwood apartments and am no longer a Landmark customer, they send me a $1500 bill that includes not only the rent and utilities my former roommate owed, but also all the damages and cleaning fees. That's $1500 AFTER my deposit, which I did not get back when the lease was terminated in October.\n\nThinking it was a misunderstanding, I called the office several times over the course of the week, and the property managers refused to take or return my calls. It was finally the accountant Rich who said that even with the lease termination I was still responsible for the charges, and to pay up or go to collections.\n\nWhat a nightmare.",

Our new oven arrives and I'm losing my mind because it has a clock/timer. Then I notice it has an oven light/window. Then I saw the literal warming drawer underneath. I'm just...losing my mind for this decent quality oven. It's not like they got something top of the line, but they got something nice enough to actually have in your home.

I would have written this review sooner, but our property manager, Grace, constantly threatened us with the loss of our security deposit. When we would call to ask simple questions or text her, she would be extremely condescending and rude, always threatening to take our money and potentially more.\nOut of all my years of renting properties, I have never had anyone as horrible and blatantly rude as Grace. One of my roommates moved out early and when we called to ask about details and how the remainder of our lease would go with only two of us left in the unit, she told us to grow up and figure it out ourselves because that is not her problem. The last month we were in our unit, we were automatically charged for rent despite already having paid first and last months rent when we moved in. When we called Grace to ask about when the money would be returned because it was not our fault, it was landmarks; she told us that we should not have paid (we didnt, they took our money), and that we might not even get the money back depending on how our unit looked on move out. She didnt even answer our questions, she just kept saying to not count on getting our money back. The constant threats of them taking our money made our living experience even more unbearable. As if our property wasnt disgusting and unlivable enough.\nWe were previously with Lakeway who also has a horrid reputation in Bellingham, but Landmark is definitely worse. Grace has no business working as a property manager and made us feel unsafe asking any and all questions about our property.

Then COVID hit and I left and moved onto the hotel property I managed for a much less glorious lifestyle than most seemed to imagine. Thankfully, a year and a half later I was finally able to move out, except that nowhere was available in Bellingham. On a chance, I decided to call Amy the property manager of Tullwood who, much to my happy surprise, informed me a one-bedroom had just opened up and was not even listed yet! Even better, it was the same size as other units I had been exploring but at about $200-300/month less expensive! Its a great property, all the tenants are nice and polite, lots of kids around- Amy in particular is amazing and super friendly and helpful. She goes out of her way to make everyone feel welcome while fostering a relaxed environment. The property itself doesnt have a lot of frills about it but its well maintained, and well located. The buildings are secured and locked for and added sense of comfort in addition to the gated property, and noise between units is minimal. If I ever move back to Bellingham, Tullwood is the first place Ill check out and Amy will be my first call!",

They didnt tell us until our second time applying for a place that you should put a holding fee down in order to be considered, not just the actual application fee. (If you are in the process of applying, definitely do this!! It cost us the first place we applied to, which we were in love with). We felt mislead by them not telling us this on our first application.\nThe application process was overall very pricey with lots of different weird fees, but we paid them.\nOn move-in day, a man (we later found out was the maintenance man) yelled at us to move our truck out of the parking lot as we were unloading. There was no where else to park and we werent blocking anything, plus moving everything out took like an hour, tops. It was unprofessional for him to raise his voice at us like that. We saw him a couple more times after that and he was professional and nice, and did a great job fixing our dishwasher, so maybe he was just having a bad day?\nWe have had a few issues with management not being easy to get ahold of, but as long as youre persistent youll get an answer eventually (call instead of email, this is really the only way weve gotten a response).\nThere were some really good things: Our apartment was in good shape when we moved in, clean and free of damage besides normal apartment wear and tear stuff. The price of rent is reasonable for the place we have, and we could keep our cat, which is great. The parking at our building was free and we could always find a spot, even late at night.\nOverall, it was not a great experience, but not the worst, so Ive given them 3 stars.",

These are the events: 1) The first time I had to pay rent I missed the appropriate date and instead of calling me or emailing me i was left a note on my door that I was to be evicted in a few days. I paid my rent with a $150 fine but felt like I had been treated harshly. 2) When I paid my first rent they slapped on a pet fee (that was not in the lease agreement) because I had stated in a questionnaire they gave me that I wanted a pet. The deposit (which was stated in the lease) was $500 and the monthly pet charge (which was not in the lease) was around $150 a month. 3) The first time I filled a maintenance report it was about how my dishwasher didn't use water. When a maintenance worker came to fix it they told me that \"the problem was simple and I might get the entire bill\" which made me feel award before he left silently. 4) When I asked multiple times to get my intercom and toilet fixed it fell onto deaf ears until I started making maintenance requests daily. That got somebody to come to my apartment, look at my toilet, mess with the back, and then they left me a message telling me that it was \"good enough\" and if I wanted it fixed more to call them. My intercom still doesn't work. 5) There was a time when some of the parking lot spaces had to be vacated in order to update the sewer system and Landmark left letters on several people's doors which seemed arbitrarily aggressive about how certain spots had to be vacated to a different location that was made abundantly clear that we were not suppose to park or we would be towed on those days and if we were in that designated zone the day after they switch out the sewer system then we would be towed. 6) The parking. Every person I talk to that lives here has had multiple issues with parking. There is not enough of it and people (mostly Landmark) gets tow-happy with vehicles.\n\nThese have been my personal experiences with Landmark. I have also heard from trusted sources that people who have moved out get most if not all of their deposit on their apartment's taken.",

I had a friend who moved in to a different unit in the same building and had to force them to get the carpets cleaned before he could bring his stuff in because the unit was so dirty. I left the apartment in much better shape than it was in when I moved in, and yet they charged me $500 to clean the place. I don't know that that $500 is going towards, but if the condition of how it was when I moved in is any indication, I don't think they're truly using it to clean the apartments. They charge for every little thing and treat you poorly in return.\n\nI really didn't have a strong opinion either way with Landmark before moving out. I had had a few things break, and it took a few grumpy phone calls before anyone would fix anything, but it was an average apartment experience up until move out. The apartment manager was not in the office when I turned in my paperwork to move out and I never got any sort of confirmation from her that they received it. Out of a $1300 deposit, I only got $700 back. Why? Cleaning the carpet (I expected this since I had a cat and that's the only way to get cat hair completely out for the next tenant), painting over nail holes that I filled as requested ($125... really? In what world does touch up paint cost $125?), \"replacement of drip pans\" that were spotless when I left, and $250 for \"cleaning\". Cleaning what? Beats me.

If you ever have to call to resolve an issue, you usually only get one call to the front desk before they recognize your number and stop picking up. Even when they do pick up, any time you need to speak to a manager/anyone with the authority to resolve your issue, that person always happens to be out of the office (convenient for them since the issues these individuals resolve typically come at a cost to the agency). On one occasion they pulled this routine of ignoring calls and claiming the property manager was out for lunch (at 3pm? Really?) for 3 weeks when my roommate was simply trying to get a refund because we had been double-charged for a $10 electric bill. They gave me the same go-round when I was trying to resolve an issue with the end of my lease. For weeks I called the office to inquire as to whether I would be given a partial refund for my rent payment for the month of November, given that I had committed to vacate by the 20th. All i wanted was to know if I would either receive said refund, or be given until the end of November to vacate. One final note is that, at the start of my tenure with them, they conveniently forgot the addendum on the lease that I sublet, which would state that the lease expires in November, and tried to wrangle my roommate and I into a year long commitment instead of the 3-month commitment we signed up for from the sub-letter. It took an actual visit from the sub-letter with a physical copy of the addendum in hand to overturn this mistake.

We had to put in a few maintenance requests and after waiting a few weeks we decided to call and had to keep calling them about it over and over until it actually got done. And not all of them were fixed. When we first moved in none of the cleaning or maintenance, that was suppose to be done and that's even written on the lease, was never done. The carpet smelled like pee, the blinds were bent and never went back down, one of the heaters was broken, and our washing machine leaked into the apartment right below us. The blinds later fell off without anyone touching them and we asked again if we could get new ones and never happened. They charged us for the installment of new blinds when we moved out. Currently waiting for a \"Secondary Review of Security Deposit Refund\" form that we requested because we feel we were incorrectly and unfairly charged. We'll see how long it takes for them to respond back to us. They charge you at such a high rate for cleaning and maintenance services after you move out. They charged us $200 for cleaning services. What's the point of spending hours cleaning it yourself if they're just gunna charge you out the ass to have it cleaned. They also charged us $135 for carpet cleaning, which I can somewhat understand, and they also charged us $188.32 for other maintenance repairs, which is a joke when they never get any of your maintence requests fixed when you're living there. Never again will we go back to Landmark to look for an apartment. Very poor customer service. Just finished watching the review move out video on YouTube and I hope they're not blaming us for all those rips in the carpet and all the other scratches because we moved in and they were like that. We even wrote it down on the checklist, that they probably lost. Also the heaters were already scratched and the blinds that were left on the floor next to the window was when they fell and no one came to fix them after I sent in two requests. The Maplewood apartments are really old, so we were expecting the usual wear and tear of our apartment when we first moved in, but when you write down the damages on a checklist when you first move in and then feel like you're being blamed for them is not how you should treat your customer, especially when you're trying to gain more customers or want returning customers.

Since applying which took a full week and we couldnt even get ahold of anyone on the phone during that time. The unit was infested with cockroaches and the bug maintenance people came out every week and it did nothing. Maintenance calling numerous times because they forgot if they came out or not. Like what a joke. And then upon move out they took our whole security deposit. And now we owe money?! It took two maintenance guys 6.5 hours to replace some blinds, a closet door, drip pans, and a screen vent?! They said it took them an hour two replace drip pans and 2 hours to go shopping. And apparently they arent a capitalist company. Stay away from this company thats what I have to say.",

          "text": "Hi Rebeka, I just wanted to answer some of the comments from your review, Our application process is about 5 to 7 business days. From your tenant page you had applied and moved into the unit during our pre-leasing season which is our busy time of year for Landmark. During pre-leasing our phones do ring nonstop and can only be answered so quickly.  From looking into your service requests we had only one request about the cockroaches and I know we would have been more than happy to come back to your unit and resolve the issue had it not been resolved the first time. To answer your concerns about your security deposit, in the Landmark lease under Deposit and Non-refundable Fee Agreement it does say \"a charge will be made for the cost of restoring the Premises to its original condition for any damage incurred during this tenancy, normal wear and tear excepted.\" We wish you luck in your future renting experiences and thank you for your feedback."

The next time rent came around, they told me that one of the $100 bills was a fraud & that they sent that bill & my name to the secrete service and told me it was my problem and that I still need to pay $100. I did not consent, they had no proof, and they flat out were just handling cash in the background behind the counter loosely. Needless to say I told them I was going to take action and they credited the $100.\n*Note: they have implemented online payments and have seemed to pull that together quite a bit.\n- A lot of unnecessary fees\n\nPros:\n- When I moved in, I requested that the carpet be pulled and replaced due to a previous tenant; they did right away.\n- To come and fix the microwave due to inactivity; they did in a reasonable time frame.\n- Management did multiple upgrades & consistent inspections to the property\n- I cleaned my apartment and returned it during move out day and received 77%, I guess that is OK due to having a dog, painting the walls, & forgetting to clean the oven.\n\nBesides the issue above and me cleaning the crap out of that place for only a 77% return, I actually didn't have the worst experience with them.

        "review": "There are a lot of opinions about Landmark out there, I will leave my review based solely on factual occurrences:\n\n1. I moved out and moved into a new Landmark property. Well over 21 days passed and no deposit or statement of fixes was given. When I inquired after a couple months, they sent me a check for just over $10.00. I followed up with a demand letter for entire deposit citing the RCW they were blatantly attempting to violate, they refunded the full deposit within one week.\n\n2. When moving out of our last place after buying a home, I wanted to make sure they still had the move in inspection form we signed; they legally need to have a copy on file to be able to keep some/all of a damage deposit and they also are legally required to provide a tenant one copy when asked during that tenants tenancy.\n\nWhen we asked for a copy, we were told it wasnt available, it was filed away in storage off site, they had switched from paper files to digital since we moved in and they may not have it at all and theyd have to get back to us a different day, etc. After a rather large commotion and being threatened to have the cops called on us for harassment because we knew exactly what we were entitled to, they conveniently sent over the electronic pdf of the document via email within literally 21 minutes of us leaving the office. Very impressive if it was indeed a hard copy only stored offsite like they stated.\n\n3. We had to break our lease due to buying a home and went through their break lease option, electing to pay rent until it was re-rented. They immediately listed the property for $1,500, multiple hundreds of dollars more than the $1,300 we were paying. Certainly their right, just seemed scummy.\n\nThere were some other instances of subpar property management, but these two situations told me everything I need to know about how they do business. There is a reason they are one of the worst review property management companies in Whatcom county.",

We waited for them all day, and they didn't show up.  2 days later, there's a knock at the door, the contractor they hired to work on the apartment.  Ok, not the day you said you'd be here but sure, come on in.  I left for work and came back to brand new heaters, which were very nice and solved our heating issues.\n\nWhat was not included in the notice we received was that there were going to be large holes in the walls around the heaters, since the new ones were so much smaller.\n\nThere are heaters in every room of the house.\n\nI thought it was weird, and it's a little jarring to walk into your home and see that much damage without warning.  So I waited a couple of weeks thinking maybe they were busy, there are 10-20 units in my complex, it probably takes time.  I tried to be very understanding of things and I've worked in a hotel under construction before, I understand that sometimes things get delayed and it sucks and I was patient.\n\nAfter a month went by and I heard nothing, I called them and asked about the repairs.  The assistant manager of this property, who was and is very nice, and has continued to be kind and sound so understanding, has been the only one who would talk to me when I called.\n\nBut as nice and understanding as she sounds, she still does not call me back with more details like she continues to say she will, she does not leave any messages, every time I call, I get told that they're working on it and it's the contractor's fault.\n\nJust gonna cut in here to apologize for the long review, but I just want to prepare you for what to expect should you decide to move into one of their properties.  Wish I had known before I renewed my lease with them.\n\nFinally, in JUNE, the contractor shows up.....but he only fixes half of the holes in the house.  My roommate was asleep in her room at the time, but the contractor told me not to worry about waking her up, since he had to come back one more time anyway, to put in the baseboards where parts of those holes still remain in every single room.\n\nWe are now to the point where I call them every week or two, and have the same lovely conversation with the same nice sounding lady, who tells me every time how frustrating it is for them as well.\n\nAnd now we are a week away from AUGUST.  For those of you not keeping track, it's now been 4 months of foot-long holes staring at us while we sleep, cook, eat, use the bathroom, watch TV, and when we go to leave.  It's the first thing you notice when you walk in the door, and the last thing you see on your way out.\n\nOh, we've had a bunch of fun with all those carpenter ants and spiders and earwigs coming into the house because of this issue.  It's just been a BLAST.  Thanks for raising our rent in June as well!  I really think those improvements you made are worth paying you an extra $25/month.\n\nI work in a job where I see about 50 new people every day and am encouraged to have conversations with them while they wait.  I come into contact with people new to the area and looking for advice on where to live almost daily.\n\nI'll make sure to pass this story along to all of those people, just to make sure we don't have any more \"frustrating experiences.\"",

They leave taken units up after someone has put a holding fee down and let people apply for them, then send an email saying its unavailable but you can transfer your application to another listing (they will refuse to refund it even if the unit was not available at the time you applied even though they still had it listed). This can be good depending on if there are lots of  listings that appeal to you, however it seems to be a ploy to make people feel invested in Landmark and to then try to force themselves to find a place to apply to with Landmark. I applied to two unrelated units at 6-7pm, and 8:48 am got emails saying that both units had had holding fees placed on them.  I asked to know the exact time for the holding fee because one of the units had been listed for months untouched, so I found the timing a little suspicious that they had been taken overnight just like that. Additionally, they post new units usually when they are closed so you CAN'T call. You have to risk losing the unit by waiting till they open to ask about availability, or risk the wasted fee; they know what you will choose and are literally banking on it. They never got back to me so I can only assume that the listing were taken loooong before I ever applied. They even updated the availability date of on of the units to \"Available Now\" after they informed me it had been taken. EDIT: Further proof of this suspicion was confirmed when I saw the same taken apartment newly listed on FB marketplace 3 days after a I was informed a holding fee had been placed on it and they had stopped accepting applications on it.

Secondly, the place that we currently live has needed so many maintenance issues updated on it that were supposed to be completed before we moved into the place. We've had our lease for about 5 months now and they still have yet to complete them all. On top of that there were minor issues that were submitted as maintenance requests, and when confronting them over several weeks later they denied ever receiving any requests. When asks when they would be able to send someone out they said that they had no idea and couldn't even give a time frame. I told them that this was unacceptable and we've been waiting for weeks to have several minor issues resolved (this would take an hour out of any maintenance persons day if even that) they got extremely defensive and then started being the most disrespectful to me for simply asking for a date to schedule a maintenance appointment. As someone who has worked retail for several years and seen a lot of bad customer experiences, this takes the cake as the worst customer experience ever.

The leasing agent also told me that they were going to have to pull up all the carpet and even replace a missing match in the linoleum and had me view another apartment that was not trashed but would not be available.\n\nThe location was good, very close to the college and they promised everything would be better when I moved in; they had 2 months to get it redone! When I showed up to move in most of the stuff that had been there was gone but there was still trash, the carpets had not been cleaned let alone replaced like the promised and turned my shoes and feet black when I made the mistake of walking on them. The flooring was still missing in some places. There was broken glass in the garbage disposal and mold in the fridge. Everything that could be covered in dirt and mildew was.\n\nI went straight over to the leasing office where I spent time being told the carpets had been cleaned, the manager was sure they had been because the cleaning company sent a bill, though now he couldnt find it. finally he sent over a cleaning person and when she got there she realized how bad it was and called two other cleaners to come help her. They still could not get it done that day and I had to delay moving in. They promised to still replace the carpets and they have not. they also would not let me out of the lease, though I could find someone to take it over and forfeit my $1,700 in deposits and rent I had already paid.\n\nIts just been worse since then. If you do decide to rent from them still after all the reviews dont ever need maintenance done. Days after moving in I noticed the toilet was leaking. I thought Id let them know that something else had been missed. It can cause damage after all. The maintenance person came out and took apart the whole toilet, rebuilt it. he said he replaced some rings and washers and then said the reason it had been leaking was because there was too much weight being placed on it. ok, so I rest a roll of toilet paper on the tank but come on how much can that weigh? What  a nice way to blame the new tenants and call us fat. Which I dont think we are, me and my husband weight about 190 and 185. I dont think that should break a toilet in a week. And they charged me $70 for the privilege of being insulted.",

It started when we had to sign a lease 6 months prior to moving in.

Getting repairs done was a nightmare- I had to threaten legal action just to get running water and lights on in the house. We received erroneous bills in the mail which they would say were 'taken care of,' only to receive another bill plus late fee later. They are extremely unscrupulous about returning deposits. Legally they have 14 days to return your deposit so they send a letter stating they are holding your deposit for \"estimated\" charges. They claim you'll get it back once they receive receipts from their vendors. Good luck! You have to continuously call and email to get any response.

I made several attempts to contact the staff at Landmark and no one ever contacted me back about repairing my fridge. I left two emails, voice mails and even went into the office on two separate occasions, still no one contacted me to tell me if and when someone would be over to fix my fridge. Then, low and behold, four days later, a repair service calls me at 8 am to ask if they could come over and look at it that day. Sure, let me take a half day off of work and miss out on pay because no one could call me to schedule a time. Since having a working fridge is pretty big deal I had to leave work early so that I could meet the repair man since he didn't have a key to my apartment. Then, after wasting half of my day the repair man tells me he'll have to order the part and it will be next week before my fridge is fixed. Unfortunately I can't go without a fridge that long. I have a young son that needs to have milk for his breakfast as well as other drinks, snacks, food, ect. So I called Landmark once again to find out what they were going to do to help me until my fridge was fixed. The answer I got was, \"I don't know.\" Not the answer I was looking for. In addition to this the person who answered the phone, James, was very rude, but not as rude as the person I contacted next, my property manager, Heather Helford. All she did was make excuses as to why it took so long for a repair man to come out and look at my fridge. I don't want your excuses, I just want good customer service. Lets get one thing straight, if it wasn't for people like me paying rent, then you wouldn't have a job Heather. On the same note, if you're so frustrated with your job that you treat your customers like crap then perhaps it's time to find a new line of work as customer service is not your strong suit. Call me crazy, but I would think that you would want to make sure your tenants are happy so they continue renting from your company. I've lived here for four years. And in those four years I've always paid my rent on time, if not early and when something breaks down I don't think I should be verbally abused over the phone.",

The floors literally had feces and gum and other gross stuff on it and we have no idea how they would get there. There are nails coming out of some of the floors. The house smelled so bad the first day we moved in it nearly made us puke and we spent our own time and money having to clean it ourselves. The house obviously has not been well maintained at all because all of the paint is cracked, floors are creaking and when we scrubbed them over and over (probably more than 10 times) it would come up black every time, the washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher are ancient and look like they belong in a museum, we dont have a garbage disposal and pretty much all of our plumbing is clogged, a lot of the windows dont work, our front door lock looks like the most unsafe door lock Ive ever seen, and all of the outlets are 2 prong which is not safe because they are not grounded.

We try our best to be understanding and accommodating to all our tenants and any issues that arise while renting with us, we only hope that our tenants can be understanding and patient with us in return."

Please know that Landmark contracts with a carpet cleaning company and they clean carpets each time a home is vacated -- at the end of a lease -- as part of our tenant changeover process. One exception is in lease takeover situations when individuals are assuming a lease from someone else. Carpet cleaning and walk through inspections are not done at that time, those tasks are done at the end of the assumed lease. With regards to fleas in the unit, at the end of each lease (when tenants move out) our property managers check for pest issues during their walkthrough. The carpet cleaning company also reports any they find. If fleas are found, we send in a certified pest company to take care of the issue. If a tenant moves into a unit and finds there are pests of any kind, they should report that to us right away."

They never call or email back, especially when it's regarding money that they STEAL from you. We paid our rent online using their new online payment system and it charged us a $75 late fee when it WASN'T LATE, and they NEVER paid us the money back. They kept going on about how the accounting team was \"working on it\", which is a flat out lie. They do everything they possibly can to screw you out of your security deposit, so unless you plan on spending multiple days cleaning every nook and cranny of your place you can kiss that money goodbye. The people who work there are the rudest and most incompetent people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting, and the company just seems incredibly disorganized and unprofessional in general.

For instance, if you have a married couple and two children, for a three bedroom apartment, they will expect an extra $100 rent / month, despite each child getting their own room and the married couple sharing a bedroom.\n\nThey were non-negotiable over the phone, regarding this fee, even when we indicated we were not college students, but rather, a married couple with one child seeking a two-bedroom apartment. They stated that since there would be three tenants and it was a two bedroom apartment, we would have to pay an extra $100 rent / month, regardless of the fact that my wife and I would be sharing a room. We had friends (a married couple with two children) who had an identical experience to ours, indicating that this is a consistent practice for Landmark.\n\nThis practice seems like an instance of housing discrimination based on familial status, and is rather predatory in an already difficult housing market.\n\nPerhaps if Landmark Real Estate invested as much time tending to their rental management policies as they do on Google, submitting counter reviews, they might have a better reputation within the community.",

        "review": "I co-signed for my son & his girlfriend to rent a small house in Bellingham while they were students. Though we were braced for difficulties because of some of the bad reviews, Landmark turned out to be just fine and very fair to work with. Yes, they have fairly strict requirements to be eligible to rent or co-sign, but I dont blame them - they have to protect their own interejsts and their property owners.  Their lease is also fairly thorough and strict, but as someone who once had a property of my own mistreated by tenants, I applaud that they require their tenants to take proper care of their rental, leave it in as good a condition as they found it, and be decent neighbors while they live there. Thats really what it comes down to. I was professional and polite in dealing with them, and I received the same from them. They even offered to adjust the term of the lease so it would coincide with the end of the academic year. At one point we needed to have something done to property to facilitate the type of internet we wanted, We followed proper procedure and requested permission, and they were quick to respond and supportive.  The only reason I gave them 4 rather than 5 stars was I thought the extra administrative fee charged at the beginning was steep (I understand there are costs associated with new tenants/leases, but in my opinion it seems like that should be borne by the propery owner who is paying the mgt company to rent the property for him/her - though I should add that all the mgt companies in this area seem to do this); additionally, the property was not cleaned all that well prior to move-in (Im a perfectionist about that), and there were a couple of things that really needed refurbishing: the finish on the tub was gone to the point it wasnt possible to clean it well, and the kitchen range needed refurbishing, e.g. temp markings worn off on the oven dial so no way to set oven to specific temp  (not unusual in older places, and more of a property owner issue). But - we were very thorough and detailed in documenting the condition of everything at move-in, again at move-out (when we worked hard to clean as well as humanly possible - as all tenants should), and we had no trouble getting back the majority of the deposit (less carpet cleaning costs, which they tell you from the beginning they will deduct). Bottom line, I felt they simply want tenants to behave like responsible, polite adults (as I would want if I was the mgt co. or property owner), to follow certain procedures (like communicating in writing, which protects both sides), and they would respond in kind.",

The dryer was a serious fire hazard that we had to discover and report, rather than them do a inspection of their own property. Sidenote, the maintenance guys were all very pleasant.

It took them 6 months after I moved out, even after giving them my intent to vacate 90 days in advance, they completely ignored it and forced me to stay on the lease for nearly 6 months after I moved out and even after the new tenants moved in. The lease ended and they didn't write a new one so I was kept as a contact and a liable person without my permission and was constantly getting calls and emails about maintenance requests for months after. They break the laws all the time and get away with it because they rent mostly to students who don't know their rights. They also include some sort of owners fee to your rent which is illegal. And they make you include renters insurance in your rent which is optional but they don't tell you that. Scam scam scam, avoid at all costs.\n\n*In response to the owners response: First of all, those are NOT the only contacts I have had with you all, blatant lie right there. I did not text you in April, I came in in person and spoke with a lady named Grace and one other woman because I KNOW how unorganized you all are and have never had any luck communicating with you guys over the phone of email so I have gotten into the habit of just coming in in person as to not waste my time. Also, as you can see from the picture added, You guys were sending me emails and I was getting hassled with calls regarding maintenance requests up until the END of October 2018. I moved out, and gave my intent to vacate with this exact date: July 3 2018, IN APRIL. The lease for that address ENDED 8/20ish/18. I should have been off the lease and done with you guys THAT DATE at the latest, the last week in August because that was when the lease ENDED. I continued to be the held liable, constantly getting calls and bothered by contractors trying to fix the bathroom because both the toilets were broken. I hadn't lived there for three months and I knew all this was going on because of Landmark being negligent. The only way I was FINALLY able to get off the lease and being a current contact for this address was by this email sent on Oct 26th 2018, I responded and gave them a terrible review and they responded and FINALLY got me removed around 10/26/18, when I had moved OUT ON 7/3/18 and the lease ENDED 8/20/18 and I was continued to get calls and emails till the end of October! How is that acceptable?! No excuses. This is negligent and unacceptable. I will always tell people to steer clear, especially college kids, they pray on the young and threaten to kick you out if you don't give up and do what they say. And it is ILLEGAL to make tenants pay for renters insurance. It's a choice, and is not something that is just added to your rent. There is a $3 owners free and a $12 renters insurance fee that is added to every months rent in the portal. If tenants what renters insurance, like you said, THEY can seek out a renters insurance policy IF THEY'D LIKE. But to add it to rent is illegal and the only reason you guys are doing that is to cover yourself. Which is illegal. Someone please audit this company soon what they are doing is a crime... Can't keep operating like this and think no one will say something. I am so thankful I am not tied up with this company anymore.\n\n****If you are not sure about your rights as a renter in this town, please refer to the second picture posted. These are some resources I have found that could save you from corrupt companies like Landmark. YOU HAVE RENTERS RIGHTS! Stay educated! And reach out to these sources if you have any questions!****",

Overall I have not had a great experience and its barely been over a week since Ive moved in.",

The work order was then sent to another member of our team, Joe, within hours of receiving it. Joe then visited your house the very next day to examine the issue and informed us that it was in fact a hornets nest and that we should wait a few days before sending someone out to patch it up. A work order was sent out that Friday to have the ceiling patched up on the 14th and the entire household was contacted to inform you all that Northwest Renovations would be out there on the 14th to patch up the ceiling.We're doing everything in our power to resolve this issue for you and your roommates and we're sorry if you feel that isn't the case."

That process takes behind-the-scenes staff time, much of which is not seen by tenants when they do things like pick up keys or sign addendums.\n\nIt is the industry standard for property management companies to charge additional fees for that service -- Landmark's $250 change of tenancy fee is included and disclosed on all of our rental agreements.\n\nWe do hope you will enjoy living in your new rental home.

They had to get rid of that app within one year, but certainly didn't help those of us who were struggling.\nThe property is rundown. The rules about no smoking and pets are not enforced. There were bug problems that continued for several months. Smoke from neighbors smoking on their porches seeped into the apartment. There was a huge problem with the walkways along the 2nd story entrances. So many soft spots that I was concerned about dropping a foot through the walkway.  \nI think of all the time and all the phone calls I have made over the last year for different problems.\nThen, in the checkout process, we received approval to check out early. But this was never communicated to the Accounting department. So the Accounting department refused to honor the email approval we received from the property manager. We paid about $500 that they refused to refund.\n\nThis company seems very disorganized. And the employees do not seem very happy. Be very cautious if you decide to rent from them.",

I urge you to consider going to another leasing company for your apartment rentals/leasing if you plan on settling in the Bellingham area. I know most Yelp review pages for leasing companies will have negative reviews but I HIGHLY encourage you to read about my experience and consider going to another company when looking for Bellingham apartments/houses.\n\nWhen I moved into my apartment, I was appalled that they said that they cleaned and fixed the apartment. OK, I'm a pretty clean person but who says the apartment is considered fixed when there are holes punched into the door... Not only did we take photos of this but we reported this immediately to the leasing company and it took them 2-3 months for them to finally fix the doors.  \n\nNow, moving out I'm so appalled at this and to this day I am appalled. Our security deposit was around $800. We made sure the apartment was cleaned spotless, even better than when we moved in. Everything was fixed and tidy with no damages. We got back $24. All I said was \"LOL are you serious?\" I was so shocked at this. Did they change the carpets? Fix the blinds?  Redid the kitchen with this?!? We called so many times about this and they said they were going to look into this and we finally got an answer saying that there was damage to the apartment case closed. I'm so confused at this and still to this day as we left the apartment in better condition than before. In the end, fighting this for months after we moved out was not worth $300+ of my share of the deposit as we would always get told that a message will be taken and a call will never get returned to us...\n\nI've rented from now 5 places and this is by far the worst company I've ever leased apartments from. Even if you find the perfect apartment complex and it's through them, I want to urge you to find another place to rent from. If you choose to rent from Landmark, you better document everything with your phone (including photos and videos) of when you move in and out and ask for a final ledger upon move out. PLEASE PLEASE find another place. Now I know why the previous tenants left those holes in the apartment (see photos) and I would have probably done it too after all the frustration I faced leasing from Landmark.",

The entire experience has been nothing short of frustrating and overall exhausting. We will not be renewing our lease here when the lease is up.\n\nI do not know where to even begin with these people. The property manager we deal with is Grace Macdonald. Both room mate and I have not liked this lady from the get go. We moved to Bellingham with the hopes of finding something nicer than our old place and we settled for the place we have now with Landmark. The apartments themselves are decent and fairly new, but the management makes it so that the apartment quality isn't even worthwhile.\n\nLet us start with how unprofessional the landlord is. Every other day or so, we get texts that sound like a third grader wrote them. We have been asked to basically spy on our neighbors and be snitches on each other for Grace. Everything, from literal begging and pleading, to how to park cars etc, is texted about all the time. It seems as though she cannot properly manage her property well at all. Do not think any complaints or maintenance you have will be handled at all. We have been waiting for our washing machine to be fixed for four months now. Still nothing from them. We have neighbors above who stomp louder than elephants and we were essentially told to suck it up when we asked if they could message the people about sound etiquette. But only week one into our stay and we already had Landmark messaging us to be more quiet.\n\nThe apartments are nice... in the winter and winter only. They are equipped with heaters in all rooms. But in the summertime, these apartments will make you feel like you are in a slow cooker. NO AC whatsoever. Be prepared to drop $400 on an AC unit for your place. The apartments are on the expensive end. 2 bed and 1 bath is close to $2000 every month, including all utilities. We are broke. the bedrooms are also small as hell. The security deposits and pet fees are outrageous too! Each cat is $500 and an additional $40 every month to your already ludicrously expensive rent.\n\nThere are no amenities at all. No covered parking, no garages, no pool, no gym, no clubhouse. You get the idea. What you DO get offered by Landmark is a gardening plot and paid parking spots. But, as the name suggests, they are paid for monthly. So, in addition to expensive rent, you can pay $60/month for a parking spot no closer than 95% of the parking and $30/month for a box of dirt. Money greedy.\n\nBottom line, living here has felt like being watched over by the Gestapo - Landmark cares solely about money and making their tenants miserably controlled. Never renting from these people again.",

I applied on May 25th and did not get an approval until 6/24 to get keys THE NEXT DAY.  I had spent weeks asking for updates so I would know whether to start cleaning and packing.  Their stupid online application system makes it very difficult when getting an ESA animal approved...even though my dog had lived with me on an approved status for the last year!  My letter was 13 months old and they wanted one within the last 12 months.  The online portal was locked from edits, but Landmark would NOT accept an email of the letter.  The whole thing was NOT my fault.\n\nAnd then....with 5 days to move in record setting heat wave, I asked for an additional couple days to have a hidebed couch taken out by Habitat for Humanity.  They gave me until July 1st.  Not helpeful.  It is 8/21/21 today and my old apartment still sits empty.\n\nThen they charged me 6 additional days of rent in July as well as 8 hours of cleaning!  They place was awfully cleaning but for some cleaning residue and a few bits on debris on the floor that likely blew in as they opened the door!  \n\nI disputed the refund amount and got back half of what I was asking for accompanied by a bitchy email from Cherise.

        "review": "There are a lot of opinions about Landmark out there, I will leave my review based solely on factual occurrences: \n\n1. I moved out and moved into a new Landmark property. Well over 21 days passed and no deposit or statement of fixes was given. When I inquired after a couple months, they sent me a check for just over $10.00. I followed up with a demand letter for entire deposit citing the RCW they were blatantly attempting to violate, they refunded the full deposit within one week.\n\n2. When moving out of our last place after buying a home, I wanted to make sure they still had the move in inspection form we signed; they legally need to have a copy on file to be able to keep some/all of a damage deposit and they also are legally required to provide a tenant one copy when asked during that tenants tenancy.\n\nWhen we asked for a copy, we were told it wasn't available, it was filed away in storage off site, they had switched from paper files to digital since we moved in and they may not have it at all and they'd have to get back to us a different day, etc. After a rather large commotion and being threatened to have the cops called on us for harassment because we knew exactly what we were entitled to (we actually offered to call our family friend for them who is a sheriffs deputy on duty at the time, they declined) they conveniently sent over the electronic pdf of the document via email within literally 21 minutes of us leaving the office. Very impressive if it was indeed a hard copy only stored offsite like they stated. \n\nThere were some other instances of subpar property management, but these two situations told me everything I need to know about how they do business. There is a reason they are one of the worst reviewed property management companies in Whatcom county.",

They will fix little things in a reasonable time frame, but anything else takes weeks or doesn't happen. \n\nThey charge fees for everything. Be mindful of every entry because they frequently over charge. They do correct their error with a quick \"oh, sorry, our accountants must have made a mistake, we will fix that\"...but will do so multiple months in a row. \n\nIf you have fees noted in your lease (water bill, insurance, etc) be extra cautious. They charge many in   \"error\" and include a \"service fee\" for their entry of the initial fee being charged. The entry fee is only $3, but it's still frustrating to be changed a fee for them to enter a fee.\n\nWater management is also really sketchy. There's only one meter on the our four-plex, so they charge a \"water fee\" and divide the bill based on square footage and number of people in the house, but will routinely \"miscalculate\" and overcharge. Ex: We were charged $136 for one month of use in our apartment, and when we asked if we could see the bill they said \"no\", but noted that they had overcharged, and then lowered the fee to $90. We've since asked to see the bill on three additional occasions and they've said \"no\". \n\nWe will avoid renting with Landmark in the future.",

This enthusiasm for this company has quickly faded as each encounter we have had with them has been both frustrating and the staff have proven to be disingenuous. \n\nWhen asked to fix the collapsing counter in our apartment, we were told that it would be taken care of. On further inspection after it was \"fixed\" screws had been put into the base of the counter, but weren't actually attached in place to keep it steady. On first glance it looked as if it was fixed when actually no support had been given at all.\n\nAs a company, Landmark has proven time and time again that it does not care for its tenants. Every exchange through this company has been through text, impersonal, and has always included a threat. When trees were being taken down in the northern parking lot, instead of being asked to move our cars we were simply informed that if they weren't moved by the next day they would be towed. \n\nAlthough that example might seem pretty innocuous, it's a behavior that is repeated almost every time we have any interaction with them. When rent was due recently, my account that is set on autopay originally took the money from my account, but bounced it from the system the same day. Instead of alerting me to this by email, call, or text, Landmark instead taped an eviction notice to our door. Once I fixed this error with rent we were then slapped with a fee of over $100. Now while I understand the fee the real frustration has come from trying to talk to staff at Landmark.\n\nCustomer service has been unhelpful and more willing to threaten tenants than actually provide a semblance of sympathy. I know I can't tell anyone where to rent from, but my experience here has been incredibly disappointing.",

I am absolutely appalled at what others, including myself, have been through in dealing with these sharks. First of all, the main office is ridiculously unresponsive and you have to call them seemingly dozens of times in order for them to even reliably pick up and answer your call, even during stated business hours. Secondly, the terms in our lease at Sophia Place were ridiculously unreasonable. They can (and will) nickel and dime you for everything they possibly can. Want a garden plot? $50 security deposit and then $30 a month. Paid parking? $60 a month for a spot no closer than 95% of the rest of the parking spots. Also, be prepared to empty your bank account if you have pets, and the deposits are NOT STATED on the website. In case anybody was wondering, it's $500 per pet for a security deposit followed by $40 a month thereafter per pet. Speaking of prices, the cost of rent is absolutely unaffordable. By the time we moved out, we were paying almost $2000 a month including utilities and pet rent and all of that jazz for our 805 square-foot apartment. The base rent for Sophia Place got jacked up as well. It used to be $1500 a month for ours, and if we hadn't moved out, it would have been $1605 a month. Also, they do not do month to month leases. So if your lease is about to expire and you can't find another place to go, tough luck, you will have to sign for another several months, if not a year. It's whatever they decide. Also, forget about getting your security deposit back. You will never see it again, even if you make your apartment shine brighter than the surface of the sun. The staff themselves are extremely rude and sound like they absolutely hate their jobs, and the ones that don't sound like they are very clearly faking a positive attitude. If you can, please find somewhere else to live in Bellingham. It's sad that seemingly every other property in that area is owned by Landmark so it doesn't give you many options. Don't do it.

        "review": "I lived at Centre Pointe which is a fairly new condo building in Bellingham.  Landmark serves as the property manager for an individual that owns an entire building.  The units are clean and kept very well.  When I moved in, there were multiple minor issues that needed to be addressed including a broken exterior window in the master bedroom.  It took Landmark 2.5 months to have the glass replaced.\n\nWhen I moved out a couple of months ago, I cleaned the place spotless as expected and outlined in the lease agreement.  This was also noted by Landmark in the YouTube video they record while performing the move out inspection.  The only issue was noted as being some minor dust on the marble counter tops in kitchen and bathroom.  They ended up charging me a cleaning fee that was deducted from my deposit.\n\nLesson learned and bottom line (and what I have heard about all property management companies in Bellingham), be prepared as they will keep a portion of your deposit no matter what.  There is nothing you can do unless you want to take them to court.",

We tried scheduling through their online system and all three times Landmark cancelled the viewings without telling us. That's right THREE TIMES. The first time, it seemed like an arbitrary mistake, it was fine. Turns out we didn't need a reservation and were told when we called to just pick up the keys. The second time however we waited at the house for nearly half an hour and nobody showed up. We called. Turns out it was a mistake on their end. The house is still occupied and they never notified the tenant that people would be coming by to view the house. They actually apologized that time and offered to reschedule us for today. We graciously accepted the apology. Hey mistakes happen. We had a VERY busy day today and made it back to Bellingham, sleep deprived, hot and anxious to see the house and lo and behold, we waited another 20 minutes. Nobody was there. We called and the person on the phone was rude to US and blamed us for cancelling the reservation. There is no way we could have. We made the reservation over the phone. The person kept talking over my fiance and offered no apology, solution or explanation beyond that if the tenant doesn't want to show the property, they don't have to. OKAY, but I thought you just told us that it was our fault? \n\nALSO the house looks totally trashed from the outside. There is definitely potential and it was in our price range, but the yard is an absolute WRECK. Nobody has maintained that yard in perhaps years. From what we could see, the inside didn't look much better. Good riddance.

I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to some of the office staff as most were having to work from home and for the most part, they were polite to me. \n\nMy husband and I were moving back to Bellingham after living abroad, and due to the virus, were not able to see a unit in person. The website made it seem as if all tours were virtual at this point. We saw the pictures of a like unit online, which in reality looked very little like the actual unit. We applied and submitted a holding fee. I was not thrilled about submitting a holding fee before seeing the unit in person, but I was under the impression only virtual tours were being done at the time. \n\nDespite turning a holding fee into the dropbox, when I finally got through to someone around a week later, I was informed that my deposit had not been received and the unit had been given to someone else who had put down a holding fee. I found the receipt number of the money order submitted and despite the office not recording it, they had cashed the check and taken my money. After a few days of sorting this debacle out, they found my payment, told the other person there had been a mistake and gave us first dibs on the unit. We scheduled a viewing of the apartment, to which no one showed up from the office. I got a text afterwards blaming it on car trouble. We saw enough of the unit through the windows to know that it was insanely overpriced for both the area and the quality of the unit. We were homeless at this point and began looking for other units with other companies. Despite the fact that we never actually signed the holding fee agreement and they had made so many mistakes along the way, we had to accept the fact that they pocketed about 400 dollars from us for doing nothing. They had not even processed our applications until about two weeks later. It appears from reading other reviews that this is a common occurance with this company and that the pandemic is a good cover for shady business practices. \nThank God, we came across a private landlord who had our applications processed and a background check done within two days and allowed us to move in. Processing applications does not have to take weeks, be unorganized nor require a middle man to get rich on ridiculous fees. I would advise against using this company, as I would against most property management companies, but if you have to choose, avoid Landmark.",

After reading some of the other reviews (http://g.co/maps/b9hv7), I'm pretty sure it's the same shitty company.\n\nDO NOT RENT FROM THESE CRIMINALS.\n\nI'm reaching into the past to write this review, but considering this shady outfit managed to screw up my credit for several years I think it's only fair...\n\nWhen myself and two other tenants moved out of a house managed by \"Property Management Professionals\" we were given a bill that stated not only were they taking the entire $1000 deposit for the rental but demanding a couple hundred more on top of it.  The itemized list of charges was laughable; this was for a crumbling old house that the landlords had put ZERO money into for years (broken cabinets, faulty fixtures, filthy carpets, etc. when we moved in) and really needed a complete remodel.  \n\nGranted, our use of the space had added to the wear & tear so using some of the deposit money for repairs and cleaning was entirely justified.  Hell, even if they had taken the entire $1000 for this purpose we would have been OK with that.  The problem was that they demanded MORE money and each of us refused to pay it.  They threatened to send me to collections over the bill, and when they did so I received a letter stating that I had 30 days to refute the charges in writing.  You bet your ass I refuted those charges!  Did me no good, though: after repeated attempts through both Property Management and the collection agency to explain the situation and go through the itemized list of charges line by line I was completely blown off and told that I'd better just pay up or sacrifice my credit.  This being my first experience in such a situation I didn't realize what a mess that was going to be so I stood on principle and refused to pay their extortion money.\n\nWell, several years later I've found that NOT paying the $200 or so that this company unfairly charged me with no recourse has probably cost me thousands of dollars due to a lower credit rating.

BEWARE!\n\nI have been in property management in Seattle for over thirty years, and upon renting a house in the York district in Bellingham for my son and two friends I have encountered a truly unscrupulous business.  There is nothing good, fair, kind or ethical about Landmark Real Estate Management.\n\nPlease, when you move into a property take exact and perfect notes on your move-in/move-out documentation.\n\n   Carefully note the condition of the property upon moving in because if you don't you will be taken advantage of by a business that rents property in bad condition and then blames you for it upon move out.  Landmark will be keeping a $1,200 damage deposit and charges $400 for an elderly man to come mow the lawn for one hour and bills the tenant.  Granted, tenants should maintain the yard, but charging tenants about $200 each time for a lawn mow is highway robbery.\n  \nWhen I went to the managing office for Landmark to discuss these issues the general manager was no where to be found.  There was a young couple in the office suffering from the same problem - a property left immaculate and the damage deposit kept.\nI will be contacting an attorney and could care less what it costs.  These people have to be stopped. \n\nPlease, think long and hard before you use this company to obtain rental property. Just count on your damage deposit being kept and being jacked around by punks.\nGood luck.",

Lets check the CARPETS bet they didn't clean them again! Yes they put in the agreement the Kids pay 125 for carpet cleaning but somehow they never clean the carpet. Cross this off your agreement if your dumb enough to sign up with these guys.

        "review": "A one star review is generous. \n\nThough I thought I'd give yelp reviewing a go in the past, as evident by my one review, I gave it up - I didn't dig it that much. I feel this is a responsibility of mine however to divulge some interesting information and my experience with Landmark Real Estate Management.\n\nOur apartment complex, Civic Shield, was low end. We knew this heading in. It isn't flashy or particularly nice, fair. What we did not know was Land Mark's ramshackle performance of attending to our needs. \n\nUpon moving in the apartment wasn't even cleaned - we had to remind them of this. They sent a cleaning woman who spent a very reluctant twenty minutes at our apartment, repeatedly asking if she was done yet. She didn't do a great job.\n\nOur kitchen sink leaked profusely, and we had to have that fixed four separate times. Four times we had to have our master bedroom toilet repaired as well. The front bathroom sink needed replacing and the oven had to be fixed, and only one or two repairs were prompt or anywhere close. \n\nMost of this is excusable - apartment/renting stuff, no big deal right? I concur! What was problematic truly, though, was the insurgence of black mold. The apartment is built into the ground and in all of the rooms a bout of black mold started growing feverishly as soon as summer ended, and it was furious. We scrub it and use air filters and air out the room, but it comes back and back again. I believe this to mean there is mold in the walls, at least the foundation, and find this  unacceptable. To rent to people without proper inspection (giving them the benefit of the doubt here) is incorrigible. Landmark showed little to no interest in fixing this problem, but did manage to send a person to clean the mold a few times before finally using some sealant...on one part of the mold.\n\nMost disturbing is the following email, wherein I had recently called to let Landmark know that as they showed the apartment I would have no problem with letting potential renters know of my experience. Here is the response from my email, verbatum:\n\n\"If here is an issue with Landmark you need to come to us, not tell potential tenants about it. I have every maintenance request you submitted about the mold and every time we have addressed it properly and the way we are required to do so. It is not your place to tell anyone anything. Again, if there an issue you can address it with me in out office. If you have proof we never responded I need to see it in person. I have requests that show otherwise and I am more than willing to provide them to you. We have addressed all maintenance requests you have submitted. You are moving and it is not your place to tell anyone anything. Please provide me the proof that we don't respond. I know for a fact that maintenance is there right now fixing things because he just called me from there. I need the proof though please. You can drop it by the office by the end of today. I will gather our proof that we have and this will be discussed. Looking forward to meeting with you to review all of this.\"\n\nGranted I was incorrect in my assumption of there tardiness, apparently I miscounted, and we never did meet in person because of this realization on my part. There is no point in meeting to discuss their lack of haste and care for their poor property, but really what is interesting to me is \"It is not your place to tell anyone anything.\" Imagine if a burger place said, \"Here's your food, but it is not your place to tell anyone anything about your experience with our product.\"\nAgain stated later, \"You are moving and it is not your place to tell anyone anything.\"\nIt's like I rented from Bellingham's own mafia! Any ways, that's my soap box. Enjoy, rent wisely. They certainly are cheap, and we didn't die, so there's always that.",

From their point of view, every unhappy tenant is in the wrong, show Landmark even the slightest hint at your frustration, and they will break down and act like you are one hundred percent in the wrong and they should hold zero blame. Some examples to supplement my complete lack of faith for this company: Instead of handling late rent on a case by case basis and taking time to understand a tenants needs, this company has completely done away with a grace period due to the fact that in the past customers would always pay on the fifth. Great. Whatever. But when I pay my rent 24 hours late due to their servers not allowing my payment to go through, and I'm charged $134, that's absolutely ridiculous. They are also cutting a huge chunk out of our security deposit for an issue that was caused by previous tenants, and despite the fact that I sent in three maintenance requests throughout the year (all of which were ignored completely), I still get to pay for a problem that I can only help but think was charged to the last tenants security deposit to and they pocketed the money instead of using it to fix the problem. IF YOU TAKE NOTHING AWAY FROM THIS RANT OR CHOOSE NOT TO READ IT, THEN I HOPE YOU CONSIDER THIS: LANDMARK PREYS ON COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO RENT A PROPERTY AND HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO SIGN THEIR RIDICULOUSLY LOOP HOLED LEASES.

I found someone else to take over the lease, and she applied at least two months ago and still hasn't gotten onto the lease.  This was partially because her old landlords were difficult to get a hold of, but it also doesn't sound like they've been very good at staying in contact with her about that even though the landlord called me saying they hadn't been able to get a hold of her and was kind of threatening and mean when I talked to her on the phone.  My roommate talked to the landlord's assistant, but then it didn't seem like the landlord had heard anything about their conversation.  Since they couldn't get a hold of her most recent landlords, she submitted a cosigner application about a month ago and they still haven't processed it.\n\nThe main thing that bothers me is that I thought I had signed a lease extension form (and it turns out I had) and I went to landmark's office to talk to them about getting off of that, but they said they didn't have any record of me signing that form and that they just had a note on our place saying not to advertise yet but nobody signed onto the lease for next year and that I didn't have to worry about it.  When my landlord called me I told her this, but she said that she did have the lease extension form that I had signed.  Now I have to advertise for someone to take over in two months and I don't even know if they'll be able to get onto the lease in that long of a time.

        "review": "In short summary: NEVER RENT FROM LANDMARK. Landmark Real Estate Management has been completely unprofessional and negligent to my roommate and me over the past year that we have rented from them. \n\n1. Though their office is nice and the younger staff are friendly, the older women in the office are rude and their property managers are lazy. \n\n2. Upon moving into our apartment there were a host of maintenence items that should have been taken care of before we moved in. We listed these on our move in inspection and also filled out a maintenance report. In addition, the apartment was not cleaned properly. The bathroom had grime on the walls, toilet, and tub. The carpets were so dirty they filled up an entire vaccum bag. One of the locks on our front door would not work and our mail box was broken. My roommate found a comdom in the closet, along with other more minor issues. According to Washington State Rental Rights, the maintenance items should have been fixed within 10 days. It took over two weeks for only some of these issues to be fixed only after we contacted them multiple times about it. The other minor issues were never fixed because about a month after moving in we had a major issue...\n\n3. The whole ceiling above our shower began to get moldy incredibly fast. We would clean it properly but the mold wouldn't come out. We sent in another maintenance request and this time we had to send them a formal letter that they were breaching renters rights by not fixing it within 10 days (took over two weeks of multiple phone calls and office visits every few days with no response from our property manager). By then part of our ceiling needed to be replaced and the maintenance man cut a hole, filled it with plaster, and just left it like that. We had to contact them again so that he would come back and finish the job properly. It should not have taken over three weeks to fix a mold problem. Aparently it was caused by leaky pipes from the apartment above.\n\n4. With that ordeal settled it was a few months before we had another maintenance issue. My main point is that their communication and lack of response with tenants is extremely unprofessional and unneccisarily stressful for the renters involved. It seems like there should be a better way to communicate... like with phone calls and emails about progress or notification that they received the request and will fix something within a certain time frame... or something. \n\n5. More recently we received a notice to vacate within three days on our door. Both my roommate and I were gone at the time for the week so we did not receive the notice which was only sent by mail and door posting that was only accessible at the apartment that we weren't at. It seems like for urgent matters like these a phone call would be in order. The notice was for rent. Aparently their drop box was broken into on the day that rent was due and our cash and check (paid with both, yes we realize that part should not have been paid in cash, however it was a Sunday, banks were closed and one of us was out of checks that had not come yet in the mail). The more professional thing to do would have been to send out a notice to tennants that the drop box had been broken into and that they were investigating the situation. What they did was tell us we had to vacate over two weeks later and we didn't find out until three weeks later in a panic over a phone call that we made to them. After inspection their office does not have security cameras and they stated that they were not responsible for anything the public does on their property. Basically, if you use that excepted method of payment and it is breached, you're screwed! They said they put a notice out on Facebook. Why would we ever like their page after our first few experiences? In the end, since we chose to put cash money in the box that there is a note on warning not to put cash into, we decided it would be in our best interest financially to pay the extra stolen rent money instead of hiring an attorney and going to court. That's in addition to the stress caused to both of us who are students working hard to pay for school. Since my roommate's check was stolen, my roommate needs a new checking account. \n\n6. Needless to say, we have learned a lot from this experience and know what to look for in the future. We will do our best to spread the word around Bellingham and hope you do too. \n\nCheers! :D",

When we did an audit of our current parking, we discovered that tenants in 1 and 2 bedroom units had been assigned several parking spots that were assigned to vacant 3 bedroom units. Therefore, we are reshuffling things to ensure that all our tenants have access to at least one parking space.\n \nPrior to making this change official, we made efforts to inform our current tenants about the change with a notice in October of the initial audit and again in December of the final change. Both notices contained information on the reduction of parking for 1 & 2 bedrooms and the alternative location to park on Byron Street.\n \nAs for maintenance, we are constantly working to ensure tenants would continue receiving timely maintenance services.\n \nWe are working hard at Southgate to make it an enjoyable place to live. Change is not always an easy thing to endue however sometimes it is necessary to improve situations.\n \nWe hope that you understand that these changes will improve customer service to our valued tenants.\n \n-Candace"
