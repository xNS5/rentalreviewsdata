## Good
Westview Real Estate boasts properties with coveted amenities such as in-unit laundry and convenient parkingâ€”both rarities in a downtown setting. These features highlight the potential comfort and convenience that tenants can enjoy within the property.

Another positive aspect noted by tenants is the superb location of some Westview Real Estate properties. Tenants reported that the apartments' locations are very accessible and would be great places to reside purely from a geographical standpoint.

## Great
Despite the challenges faced by tenants, the quality of the apartments themselves occasionally received praise. Some users appreciated the layout and functionality of their living spaces, which seemed to meet expectations for comfort and liveability.

Furthermore, several users acknowledged the aesthetic appeal of their apartments. Westview Real Estate seems to have invested in properties that can appear inviting and potentially serve as lovely homes, judging from the physical descriptions given by some tenants.

## Bad
Unfortunately, common themes do emerge from the user reviews that point to several areas of concern. Issues with maintenance requests are repeatedly mentioned, which suggests a history of neglect from the management company. Tenants have narrated experiences of either unaddressed problems or being inappropriately charged for repairs that should arguably be the landlord's responsibility.

Communication with Westview Real Estate appears to be another significant complaint among tenants. Reports of unprofessional behavior from the management staff, coupled with difficulties in securing assistance from them, paint a picture of a company that may not prioritize tenant satisfaction.

## Ugly
Some tenants have shared deeply troubling accounts of how Westview Real Estate manages security deposits and lease agreements. It seems that in some cases, standards were inconsistently applied, and exorbitant fees charged without justification, leading to a financial and bureaucratic nightmare for those attempting to move out.

Moreover, the user reviews reveal a recurrent theme of poor customer service that extended to accusatory behavior and lack of compassion. These allegations, which have included charges for untouched rentals and unprofessional interactions, suggest a potentially systemic issue that calls for significant improvement within the company's staff training and operational protocols.
