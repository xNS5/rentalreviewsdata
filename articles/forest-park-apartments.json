        "review": "I have been a tenant at Forest Park Apts for over 20 years.  I have never paid my rent late except for this month - I was 2 days late because I simply forgot.  They put a late notice on my door for the rent plus a $50 late fee.  I immediately went to the office and dropped off my check and a letter indicating that I didn't believe I deserved to pay the late fee considering my record and long tenancy.  Royce Group sent me a letter stating I still owed $50 so I called them (Michelle Saab) thinking that perhaps they didn't get my letter begging off the late fee.  That was not the case.  She did get my letter but didn't care.  She said 30 other people were late, too.  I replied that I know for a fact no one has lived there longer than me - not even close - and that maybe I should consider giving my notice.  Her reply was \"okay.\"  \n\nA Complete lack of respect and loyalty to a very long time tenant that has never paid rent late!  Really??\n\n\nSHAME ON YOU!!",

  "summary": "<article class='review-summary'>  <section>    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>    <p>This article is a summary generated by ChatGPT, intended as a tool to help individuals find a property management company or rental property based on user reviews of Forest Park Apartments. It reflects both positive and negative aspects highlighted by tenants without including any identifying information about the individuals who provided reviews. The sentiments expressed in this article are solely based on user reviews and should be used for general information purposes only.</p>  </section>    <section>    <h2>Good</h2>    <p>The positive elements of Forest Park Apartments as reported by the tenants include commendable property management and satisfactory living conditions. Some residents reported a \"wonderful experience\" with the current management shortly after the property was acquired by a new company. The promptness and friendliness of the maintenance staff were appreciated and recommended to potential tenants.</p>    <p>Others highlighted that the one-bedroom apartments are nicely sized and appear to be quiet, contributing to a pleasing living environment. Additionally, there have been efforts seen by the new property management company to update and beautify the apartments, which has not gone unnoticed by residents.</p>  </section>    <section>    <h2>Great</h2>    <p>Exceptional instances include specific accounts of residents expressing their satisfaction with the handling of the property by the new management. One review mentioned the impact of national inflation on rent increases but did not directly attribute it to the property management's handling of the situation, indicating an understanding of broader economic circumstances. The attention to property updates and resulting aesthetics seem to be a definitive highlight leading to high resident satisfaction.</p>    <p>Though information on how often the company responded to user reviews has not been provided, the overall interaction between management and tenants speaks to a level of attentiveness to tenant needs. Positive experiences such as these illustrate the commitment to maintaining a well-managed living space for residents.</p>  </section>    <section>    <h2>Bad</h2>    <p>Despite some positive feedback, Forest Park Apartments have also garnered a fair share of criticism from its residents. Concerns have been raised over the perceived high rent for the age of the property, with some residents voicing dissatisfaction with the value for money. There was mention of a delay in refunding a supposed deposit, hinting at possible financial mismanagement or miscommunication by the property management team.</p>    <p>Furthermore, issues with maintenance, such as providing a used and dirty washer to a tenant, have caused frustration and discontent among residents. This particular case exacerbated the tenant's discomfort, affecting their personal belongings and thus compounding their negative experience with the apartment's management.</p>  </section>    <section>    <h2>Ugly</h2>    <p>On the darker side of the spectrum, some reviews cast a shadow on the property's reputation. One tenant highlighted not being informed about a methadone clinic across the street, which could indicate a lack of transparency or consideration for prospective tenants. Additionally, instances of alleged neglect, such as prolonged maintenance work on the property's infrastructure and safety concerns with broken fences and wires, have also been reported.</p>    <p>An undercurrent of dissatisfaction stemming from the new management's treatment of long-standing tenants surfaced when a 20-year resident encountered an unyielding response to a late fee dispute. This highlighted a potential lack of respect and loyalty toward tenants, suggesting an area where the property's management could vastly improve its tenant relations and communication.</p>  </section></article>"
