Im sure this place is fine for a certain demographic but as a nurse for 30 years this is like living in a dorm. Super loud. Nobody picks up their dog poop. Ridiculous management with frequent apartment checks. My lease is up. So freaking glad. Nearly 2000$ per month for a one bedroom and I live under a hundred a twenty pound dog. Peace out PTLA.",

I never walked my dog off leash but was threatened with a $300 fine for walking my dog off leash.\n\nInsane claims about the costs and fees after I left. Don't plan on getting your money back, to owe more money after you leave.\n\nSeleni in the office is nearly impossible to reach unless they want something from the tenant.",

It's been almost two weeks and the only time I've had a chance to talk with anyone is by showing face \"since the phone isn't working, and what I could only assume emails aswell\".",
