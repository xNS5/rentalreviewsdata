The one time I found the office open I went in and was asking questions and once it got to my credit  and she found out it wasnt perfect her demeanor completely changed to what I felt was disgust as if I was bothering her  so I left the office  would not recommend going to anacortes property unless someone new takes over management",

She is always making sure the homes she manages are in top notch condition. She is very Professional and communicates well with her tenants, customers and maintenance teams. I highly recommend APM.",

I have emailed her and doesnt return emails until 2-3 days later. Gives you an ultimatum on when she can meet you on her time not yours. I have on multiple occasions asked her to communicate with me on phone but you are not worth her time. Unless you have property you want her to manage she is at your beck and call if you are a renter in need of a rental good luck. I feel sorry for the property owners who are nieve or just dont care she is making them loose money because of her lack of compassion. I will look else where.",

Takes her a few days to respond to emails, calls are not an option with these people and you have to work off of their schedule which is unfortunate if you work the same hours. I'd suggest she take a little more initiative maybe I wouldn't feel like giving a lower score than what I gave. If it wasn't already apparent I highly don't recommend you do business with them.",

The worst person to deal with is Peggy... trust me you'll know when you see her she is the most untrustworthy person, and once you sign up to rent a place through her place of business you will most likely end up regretting it. She uses the fact that you dont want to ruin your credit as a tool to boss you around. Take my warning. DO NOT RENT THROUGH Anacortes Property Management unless you want to be treated as less than dirt.",

    "text": "<section id=\"good\"><h2>Good</h2><p>Despite the majority of user reviews reflecting negative experiences, a few tenants have shared positive feedback about Anacortes Property Management. Some users have praised the property manager, noting prompt responses to issues and a generally smooth rental process. One user emphasized that their rental experience was seamless and complimented the quick handling of maintenance requests, stating that the property manager was a pleasure to deal with.</p><p>Another review highlighted the positive aspects of the properties managed by the company, with one tenant appreciating how well-maintained their home was. These comments suggest that while not universally praised, there are certainly moments when Anacortes Property Management meets or exceeds expectations for some clients, indicating potential for improvement.</p></section><section id=\"great\"><h2>Great</h2><p>The standout reviews, albeit few, feature highly positive remarks about the professionalism and management capabilities of the staff, particularly one individual mentioned frequently. Numerous positive reviews highlight their effective communication and diligent property management skills, suggesting that when issues do arise, they are often resolved amicably.</p><p>A tenant shared a glowing experience, indicating they would be eager to rent again from the property manager. These instances reveal a dichotomy where certain aspects of the company shine brightly against the backdrop of generally poor management experiences, providing a glimmer of what clients hope for in property services.</p></section><section id=\"bad\"><h2>Bad</h2><p>User reviews depict a troubling trend of poor responsiveness and communication issues with Anacortes Property Management. Several users reported repeated attempts to contact the company, only to encounter unanswered calls and delayed email responses. One tenant recounted that it took weeks for appliance repairs, despite the company quickly cashing their rent checks. Such situations indicate a lack of urgency in attending to tenant needs, which is critical for a property management service.</p><p>Moreover, a recurring complaint surrounded the perceived unprofessionalism of the property manager, where users expressed disappointment over dismissive attitudes, especially when discussing credit issues. Many reviewers felt undervalued and ignored, leading to suggestions that prospective renters should consider alternative management companies.</p></section><section id=\"ugly\"><h2>Ugly</h2><p>The most extreme user reviews reflect significant frustrations experienced with Anacortes Property Management, particularly relating to the treatment of potential tenants and inadequate handling of serious concerns. In very distressing accounts, a user described losing access to a deceased family member's belongings due to lack of communication and extensions of promises unfulfilled by the management. This has reportedly resulted in long-lasting emotional and financial consequences.</p><p>Other users were equally dismayed by the untrustworthiness and non-responsiveness of the property manager, leading to feelings of being treated as less than human. Such reviews create a concerning portrayal of a company that seems to neglect its duty to uplift and serve its clients, leaving a tarnished reputation in the local rental market.</p></section>"
